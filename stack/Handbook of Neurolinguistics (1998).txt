PREFACE 
This handbook is intended as a state-of-the-art reference and resource book describing 
current research and theory in the many subfields of neurolinguistics and their clinical 
applications. The handbook aims at reaching the newcomer to the field, as well as the 
expert searching for the latest developments in neurolinguistics. 
The contents of this handbook were shaped while the editors were driving from 
Montrdal to Vancouver. The length of the trip and the beauty of the scenery contrib- 
uted to the number and creative combination of topics. In order to cover the many 
subfields and, at the same time, keep the handbook manageable, we opted to include 
short articles on a variety of different topics instead of longer articles. To keep with 
this goal and the goal of the handbook, the authors were asked--not always to their 
delight--to focus on the most recent advances in the field and to point the reader to 
older literature by referring to review articles. Despite these limitations, we think the 
authors did a remarkable job, and the many areas covered attest to the broadness and 
interdisciplinarity of the field. 
The book starts out with three prologues; the first written by Guido Gainotti, the 
second by Harold Goodglass, and the third by Andrd-Roch Lecours and Martine Si- 
mard. Gainotti discusses category-specific disorders for nouns and verbs--a topic that 
was raised by Goodglass and his co-workers in 1966 and which does not seem to 
have lost topicality 30 years later. Goodglass surveys the advances that have been 
made in neurolinguistic research, and Lecours and Simard discuss the cerebral sub- 
strate of language from the beginning to the end of life and the impact of environ- 
mental and biological factors. 
The book is organized in five major sections, with each section subsuming chapters 
that share a common framework but that may differ widely in the topics they cover. 
Part I covers the latest research in and provides a survey of the history of neuro- 
linguistics. Part II contains chapters dealing with clinical and experimental methods 
in neurolinguistics and covers methodological and statistical considerations; clinical 
assessment and research strategies; neurophysiological and imaging techniques; brain 
lesion analysis in clinical research; the sodium amytal test; and a theoretical outline 
of neurolinguistics that tries to integrate neural organization across brainstem, limbic, 
and cortical levels. In Part III experimental aspects of neurolinguistics are pursued, 
such as current views on linguistic and psychological aspects of various levels of 
language representation and processing, and the issue of lateralization of language and 
communication is investigated from various perspectives. In Part IV the clinical aspect

Preface 
of neurolinguistics is emphasized. Language and communication in multilinguals, in 
people affected with various disease processes, such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, 
traumatic brain injury, and psychosis, and in people with developmental disorders is 
discussed. This section of the handbook ends with a collection of chapters devoted to 
the important issue of recovery from and rehabilitation of language and communica- 
tion disorders. The final section of the handbook, Part V, provides information and 
techniques that should help the clinician and the researcher in their daily work: A 
methodology for eliciting, recording, transcribing, and analyzing language and com- 
munication data is described by Brian MacWhinney. Brigitte Stemmer and her col- 
leagues provide a list of neurolinguistic assessment and rehabilitation software and 
journal and book resources relevant to neurolinguistics and related fields. The final 
chapter of the book is a compilation of useful resources on the internet. 
We not only hope that this book will be a practical and useful resource for the 
newcomer and expert but will also ignite constructive criticism from our readers. 
Despite the inspiring environment that helped create the contents and the efforts put 
into the book by the contributing authors, some topics may have slipped the editors' 
attention, or some readers may wish that certain topics had been covered or presented 
in a different way. As we hope that the book will create enough interest for the printing 
of a revised edition, we would like to encourage all readers to provide us with feed- 
back, suggestions, and information to help make a revised edition even better. 
We would like to thank the authors of the handbook for dedicating their valuable 
time to the project, for their cooperation, for their willingness to keep within the page 
limits, and for their patience with the editors throughout the entire project. The first 
author is grateful to the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier C6te-des-Neiges, 
Montr6al, Canada for the financial and accommodating support. Finally, the first au- 
thor would like to thank her colleagues and friends for their moral support and their 
tolerance of her antisocial behavior during seemingly endless times of manuscript 
battles.

Category-Specific Disorders 
for Nouns and Verbs 
A Very Old and Very New Problem 
Guido Gainotti 
Institute of Neurology of the Catholic University of Rome, Rome, Italy 
Several clinical and experimental studies have shown that nouns and verbs can 
be independently disrupted by brain damage. 
A prevalent impairment in naming actions (producing verbs) is usually ob- 
served in nonfluent/agrammatic patients, with a lesion involving the frontal lobes, 
whereas a selective defect in naming objects (producing nouns) is usually ob- 
served in anomic patients, with lesions involving the temporal lobe and the pos- 
terior association areas. The speculation is offered that action schemata, sub- 
served by the frontal lobes, may play a crucial role in the semantic 
representations of verbs and that schemata of sensory integration, subserved by 
the posterior association areas, may play a critical role in the semantic represen- 
tations of objects/nouns. 
The possibility that nouns and verbs may be selectively and independently disrupted 
by brain damage is considered by many authors to be one of the most recent and 
intriguing discoveries in the field of neurolinguistics. As a matter of fact, the problem 
has been raised in the modern neuropsychological literature in a paper by Goodglass, 
Klein, Carey, and Jones (1966) dealing with specific semantic word categories in 
aphasia, but the interest for disorders selectively affecting nouns and verbs is at the 
same time older and younger than their paper. It is older because, for at least

two centuries, the selective impairment of nouns and verbs in patients with brain 
damage had attracted the attention of literary men, philosophers, and neurologists. It 
is younger because the Gloodglass et al.'s paper did not immediately orient the work 
of other researchers, but rather became influential some years later, when the seminal 
work of Warrington and coworkers (Baxter & Warrington, 1985; McCarthy & War- 
rington, 1985; McKenna & Warrington, 1978; Warrington, 1975, 1981b; Warrington 
& McCarthy, 1983, 1987; Warrington & Shallice, 1984b) convincingly showed that 
different categories of knowledge can be selectively disorganized by brain damage. 
Subsequently, several investigations have confirmed that nouns and verbs can be 
selectively disrupted by brain injury and have shown that this selective impairment 
can be predicted on the basis of clinical (syndromic and anatomical) variables. Fur- 
thermore, some interpretations aiming to clarify the meaning of these category-specific 
disorders have been advanced. This essay will focus on (a) recalling the pioneer work 
of authors who first called attention to disorders specifically affecting nouns and verbs, 
(b) summarizing results of clinical investigations that have given a detailed description 
of these disturbances and trying to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mech- 
anisms from the cognitive and the anatomical point of view, and (c) giving a short 
account of some recent experimental studies that used neurophysiological or neuroim- 
aging procedures to investigate these questions. 
THE PIONEERS 
A curious phenomenon such as a selective loss of nouns and verbs could not escape 
the attention of literary persons. Indeed, Denes and Dalla Barba (1995) showed that 
the Italian philosopher Giovanni Battista Vico reported, in the third edition of his 
Principi di Scienza Nuova, the observation of a patient affected by a severe stroke 
who could remember nouns but had forgotten verbs. According to Vico (1744), this 
selective impairment of verbs was due to the greater fragility of this part of speech, 
since "nouns elicit ideas that leave lasting traces, whereas verbs denote movements, 
which refer to transient fractions of time and space." If Vico's observation was an- 
ecdotal and important only from the historical point of view, much more relevant from 
the viewpoint of contemporary research is the contribution of Pitres (1898a, 1898b) 
in his papers on amnesic aphasia. 1 
In these papers, Pitres offers two important contributions: (1) he anticipates our 
present assumptions that an important component of aphasia (namely, the word-finding 
impairment) may result from disruption of a component of the memory system 
(namely, of semantic memory); (2) he also describes a clinical variety of amnesic 
aphasia, which he calls "antonomasie," in which the defect selectively concerns 
nouns. In his discussion of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this 
category-specific impairment for nouns, Pitres firmly discards the possibility that this 
1I want to express my gratitude to Prof. M. Poncet (Marseille), who called my attention to the 
Pitres papers.

selective defect may result from disruption of a brain "center" that specifically stores 
the representation of nouns. Analogous to Vico, he suggests that the selective im- 
pairment for nouns may be due to a different rate of memory decay of the various 
parts of speech. However, in contrast to Vico, and drawing on a model proposed by 
Ribot (1904) to account for various aspects of memory disorders, Pitres claims that 
words denoting qualities and actions (such as adjectives and verbs) are more resistant 
to memory decay than words denoting concrete entities, such as nouns. But more 
important than these speculations is the fact that Pitres also reviews the anatomoclin- 
ical cases of patients who had shown a category-specific impairment for nouns. Results 
of this review clearly demonstrate, in contrast with Pitres's theoretical positions, 
that the large majority of patients with a selective impairment for nouns had a well- 
localized brain lesion, encroaching upon the left temporal lobe and, in particular, upon 
the left angular gyrus. This finding, as we will see in section 4 of this essay dealing 
with the anatomical correlates of category-specific disorders for nouns and verbs, can 
have a certain theoretical interest. 
THE CLINICAL STUDIES 
As I noted at the beginning of this essay, the problem of disorders selectively con- 
cerning nouns or verbs was raised by Goodglass et al. (1966), who were able to 
demonstrate an opposite pattern of performance in Broca's aphasics and in patients 
with fluent aphasia on naming tasks using pictures of objects and of actions as stimuli. 
Broca's aphasics were mainly impaired in naming actions (producing verbs), whereas 
fluent aphasics showed a prevalent impairment in naming objects (producing nouns). 
This double dissociation was subsequently confirmed by authors who focused at- 
tention on agrammatic patients (within Broca's aphasics) and on anomic patients 
within fluent aphasics. Thus, Myerson and Goodglass (1972), Marin, Saffran, and 
Schwartz (1976), and Miceli, Mazzucchi, Menn, and Goodglass (1983) noticed that 
agrammatic patients tend to omit main (root) verbs, whereas Benson (1979) stressed 
the selective difficulty met by anomic patients in the selection of nouns. Other facets 
of the problem have been investigated by means of both group studies and single- 
case studies. With the first methodology, Miceli and coworkers have shown (a) that 
agrammatic patients are more impaired in naming actions than in naming objects, 
whereas anomic patients show the reverse pattern of impairment (Miceli, Silveri, Villa, 
& Caramazza, 1984) and (b) that the same kind of dissociation can be observed in 
comprehension of nouns and verbs (Miceli, Silveri, Nocentini, & Caramazza, 1988). 
With the second methodology, McCarthy and Warrington (1985) have observed a 
selective impairment both in comprehending and in naming verbs in an agrammatic 
patient and have attributed this defect to a degradation of the semantic representation 
of actions, whereas Zingeser and Berndt (1988) have described an anomic patient who 
presented a selective difficulty in producing nouns both in the oral and in the written 
modality. An even more specific defect in verb production has been reported by Cara- 
mazza and Hillis (1991), broadening the field of investigation beyond the syndromes 

6 
Guido Gainotti 
of agrammatism and anomia. One of their patients (H.W.), who showed a phonological 
working memory disorder, was unable to produce verbs in the oral, but not in the 
written, modality, whereas a second patient (S.J.D.), who showed a fluent but para- 
phasic speech, had a selective difficulty producing verbs in the written, but not in the 
oral, modality. Finally, some authors have studied category-specific disorders for 
nouns and for verbs in patients with focal progressive degenerative diseases of the 
brain, showing fluent or nonfluent forms of primary progressive aphasia. A cate- 
gory-specific impairment for verbs has usually been found in patients with a nonfluent 
form of primary progressive aphasia (e.g., patient R.O.X. of McCarthy & Warrington, 
1985, and patient R.A. of Daniele, Giustolisi, Silveri, Colosimo, & Gainotti, 1994), 
whereas a selective impairment for nouns has been observed in patients with a fluent 
form of primary progressive aphasia (e.g., patient P.G. of Daniele et al., 5994, and 
patient D.A. of Silveri & Di Betta, in press). As with all the clinical data, these clinical 
findings have a statistical rather than an absolute value. Thus, Williams and Carter 
(1987) have described anomic patients who were more impaired in naming actions 
than in naming objects, whereas Miceli et al. (1984) have described a classical agram- 
matic patient who was equally impaired both with nouns and with verbs. Even with 
these reservations, however, the prevalent impairment of nouns in anomic aphasia and 
of verbs in agrammatism remains a well-established clinical fact that requires an ap- 
propriate explanation. Both the intrinsic structure of the linguistic disorganization and 
the location of the underlying brain lesion have been used to clarify this issue. In the 
present survey, I will summarize first the interpretations framed in cognitive terms 
and then those based on anatomical considerations. 
THE 
NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL 
LOCUS 
OF COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT 
Some controversies exist about the neuropsychological locus of cognitive impairment 
leading to a selective defect for nouns or verbs. According to some authors (e.g., 
Miceli et al., 1984, 1988; Caramazza & Hillis, 1991), this impairment should affect 
the lexical representations (and in particular the phonological or the graphemic output 
lexicon), whereas, according to other authors (e.g., McCarthy & Warrington, 1985; 
Gainotti, Silveri, Daniele, & Giustolisi, 1995), a disruption of the semantic represen- 
tations of objects and actions might underpin the selective disorders for nouns and 
verbs. Both the lexical and the semantic defect hypothesis make reference to current 
information-processing models, assuming that the functional architecture of the 
semantic-lexical system may be based on five independent representations: two 
modality-specific (visual and auditory) input structures addressing a central semantic 
system and two response-specific (phonological and orthographic) output stores (Cara- 
mazza & Hillis, 1990b; Hillis & Caramazza, 5991). According to this model, a central 
semantic disorder should express itself both at the expressive and at the receptive level 
in any lexical task requiring a consultation of the semantic system (Gainotti, 1976; 

Prologue 
Category-Specific Disorders for Nouns and Verbs 
7 
Butterworth, Howard, & McLoughlin, 1984; Hillis, Rapp, Romani, & Caramazza, 
1990), whereas disruption of a single lexical entry should affect only tasks relying on 
the damaged lexical modality. The hypothesis that the selective impairment of nouns 
and verbs may be due to purely lexical defects is supported by two sets of data: 
(a) the observation of Miceli et al. (1988) that some agrammatic patients have a 
category-specific impairment for verbs (and some anomics for nouns) circumscribed 
to the production stage, in the absence of comprehension disorders affecting the same 
categories; (b) the evidence of an even more specific defect in verb production reported 
by Caramazza and Hillis (1991), whose patient H.W. was unable to produce verbs in 
the oral modality only, in contrast with the other patient, S.J.D., who showed a se- 
lective deficit in verb production circumscribed to the written modality. 
On the other hand, the hypothesis that, at least in some patients, the defect may 
be located at the semantic level is supported by two equally convincing sets of clinical 
data: (a) the observation of McCarthy and Warrington (1985) and of Miceli et al. 
(1988) that some anomics and some agrammatic patients show the same category- 
specific defect (for nouns or for verbs) both in production and in comprehension; (b) 
longitudinal data obtained by Daniele et al. (1994) in patients with category-specific 
disorders for nouns or for verbs arising in the context of degenerative diseases. These 
authors have shown, in fact, that in their patients category-specific disorders for nouns 
or for verbs were usually observed in a single output lexical modality in the first 
stages of the disease (a pattern of impairment considered by Caramazza and Hillis 
[1991] as being due to a disruption of the part of the corresponding lexical story 
where the affected word class is specified). With the disease progression, however, 
the same category-specific impairment tended to generalize to the other lexical rep- 
resentations, affecting first the other output lexical modality and, finally, also the level 
of lexical comprehension. Now, since it is very unlikely that with the disease pro- 
gression the same pattern of category-specific impairment may develop independently 
in different lexical modalities, these data suggest that even a deficit apparently cir- 
cumscribed to a single lexical modality might, indeed, be due to a semantic impair- 
ment. The order of progression of the defect across the different output and input 
lexical modalities could, in this case, be explained by assuming that the same semantic 
impairment may have a different clinical expression in different lexical modalities (or 
in different lexical tasks) according to the attentional demand of the task. According 
to this interpretation, confrontation naming tasks might be affected first because they 
require a more active and effortful search within the mental lexicon, whereas com- 
prehension (matching-to-sample) tasks might be affected last because they are more 
simple and less demanding. 
From the theoretical point of view, the lexical defect hypothesis makes the rather 
strong assumption that not only the semantic system, but also the modality-specific 
lexical entries may have a categorical organization. According to Rapp, Benzing, & 
Caramazza (1995), this redundant representation of the word class distinction could 
be due to the fact that these categorical effects are relevant at multiple levels of speech 
production (Garret, 1980):

Guido Gainotti 
1. at the level of the semantic/syntactic representation of lexical items; 
2. in the application of syntactic rules for generating surface phrasal structures; 
3. in the procedures responsible for assigning a phonological content to planning 
frames used in speech production. 
The semantic defect hypothesis, on the other hand, has the advantage of a greater 
parsimony in that it does not assume a redundant representation of categorical infor- 
mation both at the semantic and at the lexical level. Furthermore, it gives a better 
account of the fact that disorders specifically concerning nouns and verbs were not 
observed during connected speech but during tasks exploring the knowledge of in- 
dividual words (namely, confrontation naming and word-picture-matching tasks) using 
pictures of objects or of actions as stimuli. This hypothesis, however, oversimplifies 
the complex interaction of semantic and syntactic aspects of verb representation, since 
it focuses on the central meaning of verbs (actions), paying only marginal attention 
to the roles played by a verb's arguments (thematic roles) and ignoring syntactic 
aspects, such as the subcategorization frame and the argument structure of the verb 
(Breedin & Martin, 1996). 
THE ANATOMICAL 
CORRELATES 
OF SELECTIVE 
DISORDERS 
FOR NOUNS OR VERBS 
As I said in section 1, the majority of patients reviewed a century ago by Pitres (1898) 
for a disorder selectively affecting nouns had a lesion involving the left temporal lobe 
and extending toward the angular gyrus. This finding has been confirmed by recent 
investigations, which have studied lesion location in patients with a category-specific 
impairment for nouns. As a matter of fact, all patients reported for this defect by 
Miceli et al. (1988), Zingeser and Berndt (1988), Damasio and Tranel (1993), Daniele 
et al. (1994), Miozzo, Soardi, and Cappa (1994), and Silveri and Di Betta (in press) 
had a lesion of the left temporal lobe, extending in some cases toward the posterior 
association areas. It must also be noted that these findings are consistent with the 
standard lesion location in anomia, that is, in the aphasic syndrome where a selective 
impairment for nouns is usually observed. Less clear are the anatomical correlates of 
disorders specifically concerning verbs, since in this case the lesions are more scat- 
tered. In the majority of these patients, however, a definite pattern of lesion location, 
extending from the antero-superior parts of the temporal lobe toward the infero- 
posterior parts of the left frontal lobe can be observed (see Gainotti et al., 1995, for 
a detailed discussion of this issue). 
Even in this case, the localization of lesions provoking a selective impairment of 
verbs is consistent with the usual anatomical correlates of agrammatism (where a 
category-specific disorder for verbs is generally observed). Taken together, anatomical 
data obtained in patients with a selective disorder for nouns or for verbs therefore 
suggest that a temporal lobe lesion is in any case necessary to produce a defect of 
lexical retrieval. However, the lesion extends from the temporal toward the frontal

lobe when the word-retrieval defect concerns the action names and toward the pos- 
terior association areas when the object names are more difficult to produce and to 
comprehend. 
At present, only speculation can be offered to explain why the word-finding dis- 
order may mainly concern action names when the lesion extends toward the frontal 
lobe and object names when it extends toward the posterior association areas. My 
own speculation (Gainotti, 1990; Gainotti et al., 1995) is based on three main points: 
(1) the distinction between operations of action planning and of motor execution 
subserved by the frontal cortical areas and the operations of sensory analysis and of 
perceptual integration subserved by the posterior association areas; (2) the assumption 
made by contemporary connectionistic models (e.g., Ballard, 1986; Farah & Mc- 
Clelland, 1991) that information processing and storage are not separated, but closely 
interwined in a network, since information is stored as a pattern of activity in the 
connections between the units of the net processing the same information; according 
to this assumption, the representations of different semantic categories should be 
closely interwined with the neurophysiological mechanisms that have critically con- 
tributed to their acquisition; (3) the hypothesis that the frontal lobe, housing the neu- 
rophysiological mechanisms involved in action planning and execution, may play a 
greater role in the acquisition of the semantic representations of actions and that the 
posterior association areas, subserving operations of analysis and integration of sen- 
sory information, may play a critical role in the acquisition of the semantic represen- 
tations of objects. 
A rather similar "neurological model" of naming was proposed some years ago 
by Geschwind (1967). According to this author, aphasic anomia results from damage 
to the left angular gyrus because a large variety of sensory information converges in 
this region, supplying the subject with the "attributes" necessary to arouse the verbal 
label corresponding to the semantic representation of the stimulus object. In my opin- 
ion, the Geschwind model, stressing the role of sensory attributes in establishing the 
semantic representation of objects, could explain why a lesion of their convergence 
zone, in the posterior association areas, produces a selective inability to name objects. 
A similar model, stressing the importance of action schemata in constructing the se- 
mantic representations of actions, could explain why agrammatic patients, with a left 
frontal lesion, are particularly impaired in producing and comprehending verbs (action 
names). 
Although certainly speculative, this interpretation is consistent with the view, orig- 
inally proposed by Warrington and coworkers (Warrington & Shallice, 1984b; War- 
rington & McCarthy, 1983, 1987) and now accepted by many other authors (see 
Hagoort, this volume), of a relationship between categories of semantic knowledge 
and brain systems for perception and action. According to this view, various kinds of 
perceptual and functional information usually converge in the acquisition of different 
semantic categories, but the relative salience of each source of information may be 
different for different semantic categories. Disruption of a particular source might, 
therefore, lead to a prevalent impairment of the semantic categories that are more 
heavily based on the disrupted brain mechanism.

RECENT 
NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL 
AND 
NEUROIMAGING 
INVESTIGATIONS 
The hypothesis that nouns and verbs may be stored in different brain areas was re- 
cently tested in normal subjects by Warburton et al. (1996) with a PET study and by 
Preissl, Pulvermfiller, Lutzenberger, & Birbaumer (1995) with an Evoked Potentials 
experiment. These two investigations did not give consistent results. The PET study 
showed only a quantitative, but no qualitative, difference between the pattern of cer- 
ebral activation produced by tasks of verb retrieval and noun retrieval, since the rCBF 
increase was greater during the verb retrieval task (which was, indeed, more difficult) 
but the distribution of activation was similar in the frontal, parietal, and temporal 
regions of the left hemisphere. 
On the other hand, the Evoked Potentials study demonstrated a significant inter- 
action between word class and electrode site, with a greater representation over the 
frontal regions of a positive wave form generated post stimulus onset. Because, in a 
preexperiment aiming to assess the motor and visual associations elicited by the same 
stimuli, motor associations had been much stronger for verbs than for nouns, the 
authors conclude that the greater amplitude of the Evoked Potentials recorded from 
the frontal lobes has its counterpart in the stronger motor association elicited by verbs. 
CONCLUDING 
REMARKS 
Even if the observation of disorders selectively affecting nouns or verbs is a very old 
one, the systematic study of these disturbances with well-controlled experimental de- 
signs based on sophisticated linguistic or cognitive models is a very recent enterprise. 
It is chiefly for this reason that I have focused attention in this essay on a rather simple 
and clear line of investigation, rather than discussing in detail other more complex 
and controversial facets of the problem. We cannot, however, ignore some of the most 
puzzling aspects of this issue, aspects that mainly concern category-specific disorders 
for verbs. Both theoretical and factual reasons can probably account for the greater 
uncertainties concerning the clinical features, the pathophysiological mechanisms, and 
the anatomical correlates of disorders selectively affecting verbs. The theoretical rea- 
sons derive from the controversies existing about the relationships between semantic 
and syntactic aspects of verb representation (Pinker, 1989; Jackendoff, 1990), whereas 
the factual reasons refer to the observation that a very heterogeneous set of distur- 
bances is probably grouped under the heading "category-specific impairments for 
verbs." 
As a matter of fact, if we look at patients reported in some detail by various authors, 
the following points emerge: (1) some patients, as I have noted, show a selective 
impairment for verbs limited to a single lexical modality, whereas in other patients 
this defect can be observed at both the expressive and the receptive level; (2) in some 
of these subjects, the capacity to select the appropriate abstract lexical item (the 
"lemma," according to Levelt, 1992) seems relatively spared, whereas the defect

mainly concerns postselection aspects of the verb processing. I refer here, for example, 
to patient K.S.R. (Rapp et al., 1995), who showed phonemic distortions and neolo- 
gisms in oral production of verbs and misspellings in written production of nouns, or 
to patient S.M. (Silveri and Di Betta, in press), who showed morphological (inflex- 
ional) errors with verbs, both in single word production and in (matching-to-sample) 
lexical comprehension tasks. 
The heterogeneity of category-specific disorders for verbs has been confirmed in 
an interesting paper by Breedin and Martin (1996), who have shown that different 
patterns of verb disruption (involving theoretically relevant aspects of the semantic 
and syntactic features of verb representation) can be observed in patients showing a 
selective loss of verbs. A careful quantitative analysis of errors shown on production 
tasks and of the pattern of impairment shown on theoretically relevant tasks should, 
therefore, constitute the prerequisite necessary to gather the database required to elab- 
orate more complex and detailed interpretations of category-specific impairments for 
verbs.

The last decade of the 20th century is an auspicious time to survey the advances 
that have taken place in neurolinguistics in 50 years--much of it since the mid- 
1980s. This progress has taken place through a new appreciation of cognitive- 
linguistic factors in the definition of aphasic symptoms, through sophisticated, 
on-line methods of behavioral analysis, through continued research with the tried 
and true methods of clinico-anatomic correlations, and through the introduction 
of CT and MRI scans, permitting superb in vivo lesion studies, followed by meth- 
ods for functional imaging of the normal brain in action. A particularly gratifying 
development is the growth of interdisciplinary research carried out increasingly 
by individuals who are schooled in multiple areas, such as advanced imaging 
technology, along with techniques of cognitively sophisticated experimental de- 
sign, and who also share in the accumulated knowledge from the clinico-anatom- 
ical investigation of aphasia. 
Looking back to the period immediately after World War II, it is fair to say that 
concepts of brain organization for language and methods of study were largely un- 
changed from those at the end of the 19th century. The dominant models conceived

of language as a set of faculties, corresponding to the input and output channels of 
auditory comprehension, speech output, reading, and writing, with a storage center 
for each and postulated connections between them. Only in the case of interhemi- 
spheric disconnection phenomena such as pure alexia and unilateral agraphia and 
apraxia had the role of connecting pathways been concretely demonstrated. To be 
sure, the clinician-scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries had been well aware 
of linguistically defined symptoms such as anomia and agrammatism that cut across 
modalities. These features were noted descriptively but did not influence the structure 
of the anatomical models. 
However simplistic the classical anatomic-connectionist models might seem, they 
served the goal of clinical communication and lesion localization reasonably well. The 
only competition that they had came from the theorists of the noetic or mentalistic 
school, such as Hughlings Jackson, Finkelnburg, Goldstein, and Head. 
The approach that these writers had in common was to reduce aphasia to the loss 
of a general symbolizing capacity. Jackson's concepts of automaticity versus propos- 
itionality of language use and Goldstein's notion of abstract and concrete behavior 
have been incorporated into the thinking of contemporary neurolinguists. However, 
as an explanatory model, the concept of a general symbolic capacity has been com- 
pletely overshadowed by the accumulation of clinico-pathological evidence concerning 
the specific lesion-to-symptom relationships. 
A major change in the focus of aphasia research occurred in the 1950s, with the 
influx of psycholinguists and cognitive psychologists. The very factors that had been 
neglected by the classical theorists moved into the foreground, along with the research 
methodology of experimental psychology: controlled comparisons between contrasted 
groups or contrasted experimental conditions and the use of statistical tests of hy- 
potheses. But it was not merely the trappings of experimental methodology that were 
new. The questions asked began to probe the underlying rules that might explain the 
mechanisms that gave rise to linguistic symptoms. Hypotheses were imported from 
linguistic theory and from the psycholinguistics of normal language. For example, 
Goodglass and Hunt (1958) compared the accessibility of the plural and possessive 
final s inflection for aphasics, to see if they conformed to predictions from Jakobson's 
(1956) theory. Wepman, Bock, Jones, and Van Pelt (1956) examined the frequency 
relationships among parts of speech used by anomic patients, to see if they could be 
accounted for by a frequency-based account. 
Two studies in the early 1970s greatly influenced the direction of subsequent studies 
of syntactic processing and of reading disorders in aphasia. Zurif, Caramazza, and 
Myerson (1972), by revealing that agrammatic Broca's aphasics had difficulties in 
syntactic decoding, opened the door to research guided by the "central syntactic def- 
icit" hypothesis. Marshall and Newcombe (1973), by their analysis of the basic dis- 
order of what came to be called "deep dyslexia" and "surface dyslexia," opened the 
door to the cognitive neuropsychology of written language. 
Whereas classical anatomic connectionism had as its goal the construction of an 
anatomically based architecture of language processing, the often-reiterated goal of 
cognitive neuropsychology is the determination of the "cognitive architecture" of 

Prologue

language. These hypothetical architectures are commonly displayed as flow-chart di- 
agrams of sequential operational stages, subject to injury either of a processing com- 
ponent or its connection to the next component in the sequence. They differ from the 
anatomical diagrams mainly in that they make no claim to a structural basis. 
Much of the work in cognitive neuropsychology has relied on in-depth studies of 
single cases that displayed linguistically defined dissociations of particular theoretical 
interest. Unlike the psycholinguistic studies in aphasia of the 1950s and 1960s, the 
objectives of cognitive neuropsychology are not so much concerned with the clinical 
phenomenology of aphasia as with the elucidation of normal language processes 
through data gleaned from the damaged system. The movement to single case studies 
has been motivated by several considerations. One is that selection of research subjects 
on the basis of syndrome labels is too unreliable a predictor of how a linguistic process 
of interest is affected in any patient (cf. Schwartz, 1984). Another is the doctrine of 
"transparency," expressed in its strongest form by Caramazza (1984). This is the 
presumption that the normal cognitive architecture for language is defined by a fixed 
set of basic components, any of which may be injured in aphasia, resulting in a deficit 
symptom. The transparency doctrine postulates that brain injury cannot bring about 
the appearance of processing mechanisms that were not available premorbidly; hence 
there is a one-to-one relationship between any symptom of deficit and a preexisting 
component. 
Despite criticisms leveled at the assumptions of the transparency hypothesis and 
of a universal normal cognitive architecture (cf. Goodglass, 1993), single case analyses 
by cognitive neuropsychologists have been extremely fruitful in uncovering new syn- 
dromes. They have also provided new ways of conceptualizing relationships between 
previously described symptoms. For example, the syndrome of deep dyslexia and its 
cognitive underpinnings, as well as the analysis and interpretation of category-specific 
and modality-specific lexical dissociations, are products of cognitive neuropsycho- 
logical analyses of single cases. Thus, the application of the method has added to 
awareness of the phenomena to be accounted for in the cognitive-linguistic domain. 
Methods of behavioral analysis in neurolinguistics have expanded to include an 
array of on-line methods. Until recently, the study of linguistic operations was con- 
fined to the recording of the end product of what might be a multicomponent process, 
parts of which were outside of awareness. The last decade has seen the introduction 
of an array of on-line techniques that reveal the unfolding of language events in real 
time. They include the use of lexical decision probes, event-related potentials, auto- 
nomic measures, and functional brain imaging. 
The introduction of computed tomography (CT), soon followed by magnetic res- 
onance imaging (MRI), has accelerated the pace of new clinico-anatomic correlations 
beyond anything that could have been imagined four decades ago. Freed from the 
slow and haphazard accumulation of postmortem lesion information, every type of 
structure-to-function correlation is virtually universally available. But a second revo- 
lution came into being with the introduction of functional brain imagingmtechniques 
for identifying the sites of increased local cerebral blood flow or glucose metabolism 
that signal the brain regions that are activated by an imposed cognitive task. Now it

becomes possible to examine the normal brain in action, checking out hypotheses 
derived from lesion data as to the regions that may be vital for particular cognitive 
or linguistic operations. 
The problem of category-specific lexical dissociations is perhaps the most dramatic 
instance in which cognitive theory and investigative techniques have converged with 
advanced techniques in brain anatomy and physiology. Over a relatively short span 
of years, patients have been studied as a result of their presenting circumscribed dis- 
orders in retrieving or in identifying objects of particular categories. Among the af- 
fected categories are animals, fruits and vegetables, and flowersmthat is, objects of 
nature that are known largely by their visual properties (Warrington & McCarthy, 
1987). These deficits appear most commonly in recovered herpes encephalitis. A re- 
versal of this pattern has been seen in a number of aphasic patients, who performed 
well on animate objects, but poorly on man-made ones (Warrington & McCarthy, 
1983, 1987). Clues to the mechanism for category-specific dissociations have come 
from cognitive analyses of cases (Hart & Gordon, 1992; Sartori, Job, Miozzo, Zago, 
& Marchiori, 1993; Warrington & McCarthy, 1987), group studies of clinico-anatomic 
data (Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio, 1996), and functional im- 
aging based on normal subjects performing lexical retrieval of items from contrasting 
categories (Damasio et al., 1996; Martin, Wiggs, Ungerleider, & Haxby, 1996). Not 
only do the data from these sources reinforce each other, they also converge with 
recent insights from primate research on the role of the inferior temporal lobe in visual 
object recognition (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982). 
One of the by-products of functional imaging has been the general consensus that 
the simple anatomic serial processing models probably have to give way to networks 
of interacting units. In the study of brain and language, insight has had the habit of 
arriving in small steps. Although functional imaging has proven to be an exciting new 
channel of investigation, it has thus far brought additional bits of confirmatory data 
or new observations to be explained and reconciled with others. Thus, the outlook for 
the upcoming century is for accelerating progress with new tools in the areas of 
technology and knowledge, while the goal of understanding remains a daunting chal- 
lenge.

The "aging" notion covers a time span that begins in utero and ends with death. 
This is also true for the development of language. Indeed, we shall verify this 
assertion with a discussion on the embryogenesis and the ontogenesis of the ce- 
rebral substrate of language. Later, we will demonstrate the continuing process 
of the ontogenesis of language with a discussion on sociocultural factors molding 
the evolution of oral and written language and the biology of cerebral language 
areas. These interactions between environment and biology, lasting until death, 
insofar as the brain is not destroyed, will affect the capacity to exploit language 
during childhood, adulthood, and senescence and will also determine the ability 
to recover following a brain injury. 
CEREBRAL 
ONTOGENESIS 
The nervous system has its origin in the most external layer of the human embryo: 
the "ectodermal" layer, which is already present on the fifth day of gestation. At this 
time, the rostral extremity of the neural tube resembles a median holosphere with two 
anlagen distributed symmetrically, on its right and left sides. These anlagen represent 
the subcortical structures of the brain, and the cerebellar hemispheres will be one of 
the results of their development. In this area of the brain, the left and right parts grow

equally, with no laterality effect on the rest of the body, realizing in this way what 
Yakovlev (1968) has defined as the "primary parity." Later, in the fourth fetal week, 
the telencephalon is represented by a holosphere that grows from the median foun- 
tainhead (located in the lamina terminalis) rostrally to the optic vesicle. This holo- 
sphere is the anlagen of the septum, the paraolfactory areas, the olfactory bulbs, and 
the hippocampi. Yakovlev has labeled it the "telencephalon impar" or "rhinic brain." 
The projections of these new structures are ablateral. The genetic program continues 
its course and around the sixth fetal week, laterally to the "telencephalon impar," a 
first pair of paramedian vesicles appears and constitutes what Yakovlev has called the 
"telencephalon semipar" or "limbic brain" (the limbic lobe of Broca). These evagi- 
nations are the anlagen of the cingular gyrus, the isthmus, the parahippocampal gyrus, 
the limen, and the insula. The duality of the limbic brain is not complete because 
ventrally the vesicles are reunited in the midline (or in the medial band). This fact 
justifies the term "semipar" used by Yakovlev. The projections of the "telencephalon 
semipar" are ambilateral. The formation of the limbic brain is followed, in the ninth 
gestational week, by the emergence of a second pair of left and right vesicles, dor- 
solaterally to the first ones: it represents the supralimbic structures and Yakovlev has 
named it the "telencephalon totopar." "Totopar" means a reinstallation of the parity 
between the left and the right, in other words, a "secondary parity." This parity is 
nevertheless different from the primary parity of the rhinic brain: the projections of 
the supralimbic brain are mostly controlateral. The evaginations of the "telencephalon 
totopar" are the anlagen of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (Ya- 
kovlev, 1968). 
Yakovlev considered that each of the "three brains" corresponds to a different type 
of motility (see also MacLean, 1987). According to this point of view, the rhinic brain is 
devoted to the "endokinesis" or the "cell-bound movement" related to visceral motil- 
ity; the limbic brain plays a role in the "ereismokinesis" or the "body-bound move- 
ment" dedicated to the expression of emotions; and finally, the supralimbic brain is at- 
tached to the "telokinesis" or the "object-bound movement" oriented to the external 
world. Expressive language is a good example of the "telokinetic" role played by the 
supralimbic structures (Yakovlev, 1948, 1963, 1970). 
Asymmetries appear soon, between the left and right hemispheres of the supra- 
limbic structures, during the uterine period, by way of cell differentiation, migration, 
and maturation and the synaptic competition in regions later devoted to language. The 
maturation phase is characterized by the development of dendrites, and the creation 
of synapses and will continue even during the senescence. In the uterus, the genetic 
program already decides that there will be more cells in some regions of one hemi- 
sphere compared to the homolateral regions of the other hemisphere. The best-known 
assymmetry is the one of the temporal planum, which is bigger in the left hemisphere 
than it is in the right (Geschwind & Levitsky, 1968). 
Some authors believe that the right hemisphere completes its maturation sooner 
than the left hemisphere (Chi, Dooling, & Gilles, 1977). Slower in its actualization, 
the genetic program of the left hemisphere would otherwise lead to a more advanced 
stage of maturity (Galaburda, 1984). In addition to this difference of tempo between 

Prologue 
Cerebral Substrate of Language 
19 
the two cerebral hemispheres, one might also describe the opposition between the left 
and the right in qualitative terms instead of quantitative terms. According to this point 
of view, the genetic program heading the cortical maturation would not be the same 
for the left and the right hemispheres. 
There is also a difference of tempo in the myelinogenetic maturation of ipsilateral 
structures. Yakovlev and one of us (Lecours) have demonstrated that the maturation 
of the "rhinic" and "limbic" brains is completed around puberty. However, the mat- 
uration of the "supralimbic" brain lasts longer. Moreover, each component has its 
own rhythm of maturation. For example, the maturation of prethalamic fibers is pre- 
natal for audition and perinatal for vision. Also, the maturation of visual thalamic 
efferent fibers to the primary visual cortex is realized by the end of the fourth month 
after birth, perhaps sooner, whereas the maturation of auditive thalamic efferent fibers 
to the primary auditive cortex lasts much longer, approximately four years (Yakovlev 
& Lecours, 1967). This difference of tempo between the maturation of auditive and 
visual tracts is very interesting considering the importance of auditive projections in 
the development of language. 
There is not only a difference of tempo in the myelinogenetic maturation of the 
auditive and visual tracts. Paul Flechsig, one of the most important pioneers to map 
the myelinogenetic maturation of different areas of the brain (Flechsig, 1901), found 
that the myelinogenetic maturation of the primary cortices is completed a long time 
before the one of the association cortices (primordial myelinogenetic fields of Flech- 
sig), and is followed by the myelinogenesis of specific association areas of the su- 
pralimbic cortices (intermediate myelinogenetic fields of Flechsig). Finally, the my- 
elinogenesis of the intracortical neuropil, taking place in nonspecific association areas 
of the supralimbic cortices, begins several years after birth, is very slow to develop, 
and may last even during adult life (terminal myelinogenetic fields of Flechsig). A 
good example of this phenomenon is the myelinogenesis of the intracortical neuropil 
of the angular gyrus, which starts around the age of 5 and continues until the age of 
60, according to Theodor Kaes (1907). One should remember that the angular gyrus 
is very important in comprehension of language presented in visual as well as auditive 
modalities. 
INNATE 
PROPERTIES 
AND INVENTIONS 
Paul Broca (1865a) was the first to declare that the functional specialization of the 
left hemisphere for language happens as a result of a genetic programming of the 
human species. It is now usual to teach in medicine or neurosciences, orthophony or 
psychology, anthropology or linguistics, that oral language is an immediate expression 
of an "innate property" of the human brain. It is assumed, however, that written 
language is an invention of humankind. 
This viewpoint has been supported by two observations: on the one hand, when 
there is no extreme social anomaly, a child is considered biologically abnormal if he 
or she does not learn to speak in the first years of life; on the other hand, the acqui- 

20 
Andr~-Roch Lecours and Martine Simard 
sition of written language, otherwise mandatory, is less perceived as an obligation 
than the learning of oral language. Someone might be uneducated but biologically 
normal. 
The second argument might be appropriate if the human species were considered 
as a whole and in the present time. Yet it can be misleading. There are indeed some 
human subspecies for whom this argument is not suitable. A child would not corre- 
spond to the norms of society if he could not learn to write and read in an environment 
where schooling is obligatory. This phenomenon takes place more frequently in boys 
than in girls in a ratio of 4 to 1 and there is some reason to believe that it can be 
caused by a neurogenetic particularism. The child presenting this kind of problem 
might have a level of intelligence exceeding the "normal" level, and sometimes far 
beyond the average (Lecours, 1996). 
This reconsideration of classical education with an opposition between oral and 
written language leads to a review of the history and the definition of language. First, 
the history. Forty thousand years ago, perhaps more, socioenvironmental pressures of 
unknown origins were exerted on several human communities, already supplied by a 
genetic potential, to progressively develop speech. Fifty-three centuries later, external 
pressures of another nature (increasing demography, town development, prosperity, 
commerce), determined by the impact of the first invention (i.e., speech), forced one 
or many human communities to extend the genetic potential of the species and to 
invent writing. In other words, throat and hand languages are equally the expression 
of human biology. They both actualized themselves along with the evolution of hu- 
mankind, depending more on the collective pressures than on individual constraints. 
The definition of language that we are referring to is different from the one given 
by several linguists. It seems that language can be defined without the opposition 
between oral and written aspects as well as without an opposition between the gesture 
codes of deaf individuals and the digital reading of blind people. In our opinion, the 
definition of language refers to two parameters. The first relates to human biology 
and the second is based on social interactions between individuals. 
In reference to human biology, language seems to be the behavioral manifestation 
of at least two different properties. The first property allows the creation of arbitrary 
links between sent or received conventional signals and external or internal facts; the 
second authorizes the combination of these signals following other arbitrary conven- 
tions. 
In reference to social interactions, the genetic program that permits language could 
not actualize itself without the influence of a human environment. Beyond the in- 
vention of language, the control of language implies that someone has to "learn" 
and the "learning" can only be provided by the outside, by the knowledge of others. 
This conception of the history and the definition of language supposes that the de- 
velopment of the species follows the same rules as the development of individuals. 
Genetic potential and environmental pressures both play necessary and complementary 
roles. 
There is a big difference, however, between spoken language and sign language, 
on the one hand, and between written language and digital reading, on the other. The

first of each of these pairs are always learned by reference to the outside world, and 
the second are learned by reference to the first. In our opinion, this implies that the 
invention of writing and the learning of written language are dependent on the neu- 
ronal systems without any linguistic specialization along with the neuronal systems 
already committed to oral language. All these considerations raise questions as to the 
notion of an innate property of the human brain for language. We now believe that 
the biological substrate of language might be dependent on two innate and interac- 
tional, but also distinctive, properties. The first enables an individual to invent or learn 
and then utilize conventional and abstract signals. These signals are presented to the 
senses and are arbitrarily matched with the knowledge that individuals have of them- 
selves and their environment and with the knowledge that their peers might have of 
these signals. If the human species exploits this capacity to create conventional ab- 
stractions at a very high level, other animal species share this aptitude in more simple, 
but always inventive and adaptative, modes. 
The second property is unique to humankind. With the adjustment from sounds to 
words and from words to sentences, and then from sentences to speech, the second 
property permits combinations of abstractions following conventional rules, also in- 
vented and arbitrary. This capacity of the human species increases the possibilities of 
communication of thoughts. Other kinds of combinations allow several possibilities 
for the communication of emotions. 
DIACHRONY 
The individual evolution of language behaviors is, to a certain extent, formed by 
sociocultural pressures. However, studies conducted in the laboratory of Jacques Meh- 
ler have shown that human babies are prepared, in advance, for language. As soon as 
babies leave the uterus, (a) the voice of their mother is already familiar, (b) they 
already recognize the noises relevant for language, (c) they are able to make a dis- 
tinction between their mother tongue and other languages, and (d) the majority process 
language information with the left hemisphere more than with the right hemisphere 
(Mehler & Fox, 1985). In other respects, one should not forget that upon leaving the 
uterus, human babies and babies of other mammals have been listening for a long 
time, but they have never seen anything. This fact is essential if one wants to have a 
good appreciation of the impact of environmental information on the actualization of 
innate properties of the brain. 
Undoubtedly, the ontogenesis of language starts very early in the human being, 
even before birth, and will last for a very long time. First, oral language or the 
"primary code" will take place, followed, in several societies, by written language or 
the "secondary code." Beyond the intrauterine mysteries, the "primary code" is first 
learned by imitation, within the restricted boundaries of family and neighborhood. 
This functioning allows a normal child to deal with his or her native language, syntax 
included, around the age of 4 or 5. However, except very rare cases, there is no 
consciousness, at first, for the rules underlying language. One should remember that 

22 
Andr~-Roch Lecours and Martine Simard 
the myelinogenetic maturation of thalamic projections to the primary auditive cortex 
ends around the age of 4 or 5. 
It is around the age of 7, that the learning of the "secondary code" begins, only 
this time the child will follow the formal and explicit conventions of the primary 
school. This learning will take place in a "transitive" mode, by referring to the sounds 
of the "primary code." Inherent to the social privilege of schooling, this dichotomy 
between the "primary code" and the "secondary code" is certainly valid. However, 
this concept should not hide the fact that after primary school and its formalism, the 
learning of language will continue without any dependency of written language on 
oral language. In the case of individuals who integrate written language into their life, 
it is undeniable that they first learn numerous words and some syntactic arrangements 
with their eyes, and not with their ears. Later, they will use these elements in writing 
or in speech. 
In summary, the subordination of written language to oral language might decrease 
with time, when the ontogenesis of language continues. As long as the brain remains 
healthy, written language can assume a predominant role and can have an important 
impact on cerebral biology. In democratic countries with a free-market economic sys- 
tem, it is not rare that older people read more and refer more to dictionaries than do 
younger individuals. 
Also part of the ontogenesis of cognition and language is a decline of memory, 
which is inherent to the normal aging process. It may happen sooner in some indi- 
viduals than in others. It does not affect all kinds of memory: semantic memory (Smith 
& Fullerton, 1981) and implicit memory (Light, Singh, & Capps, 1986) are usually 
spared by the aging process, whereas explicit memory (Flicker, Ferris, Crook, Bartus, 
& Reisberg, 1986) and the active component of working memory (Salthouse, Mitchell, 
Skovronek, & Babcock, 1989) capacities seem to decrease. Nothwithstanding these 
discrepancies in the involution of memory, word access is always altered by age 
(Belota & Duchek, 1988). In everyday life, this deterioration of memory might affect 
language: as a compensation mechanism, there may be greater "verbosity" of speech 
together with periphrases to mask the difficulty of lexical evocation. This is often a 
"frequency effect" or a more automatic and efficient utilization of syntactic proce- 
dures (Obler & Albert, 1984). The deficit of lexical evocation is frequently uncon- 
scious. Despite the fact that this phenomenon refers to involution, it can also be 
considered, in our opinion, as one of the latest stages of the ontogenesis of language. 
Sociocultural factors are very important in brain-language interactions. Indeed, 
they can facilitate or even enforce the development of a certain biological potential 
of the human brain. We now consider oral language and discuss it in relation to 
sociocultural factors with two examples. 
1. In some parts of the world, in Vietnam, for example, people speak so-called 
isolating tongues. In these tongues, most of the words only consist of one 
syllable. The meaning of each word is specified by the tonal pitch given to its 
vowel. Each word may have as many as six different meanings depending on 
the pitch of the vowel (which can be increased, decreased, or modulated). The 

Prologue 
Cerebral Substrate of Language 
23 
brain must then adjust its functioning during all its ontogenesis to enable 
individuals to use that many tonal pitches, which, elsewhere in the species, 
have no role to play in the comprehension and production of the speech. 
2. In other parts of the world, in Poland, for example, people speak so-called 
flectional tongues. In these tongues, most of the words consist of many 
syllables that correspond, in several cases, to prefixes and suffixes. The brain 
must then mold its functioning in a way that enables individuals to juggle an 
impressive number of syllables all their life. These syllables only play a role 
in modifying the meaning of the root to which they are tied. 
We now consider written language and give three examples about two genetical 
potentials of the brain sustained by a different biological substrate. 
1. "Logographic" writing systemsmthe one of China, for example--which 
allow people speaking different languages to read the same newspapers, 
exploit maximally one of these genetic potentials, which is to memorize 
written words in their global form. 
2. Other writing systems, related to only one spoken tongue, favor the other 
genetical potential, which permits the processing of written information by the 
"conversion" of smaller entities of words from their auditive forms to their 
visual forms or vice versa. Spanish reading and Italian writing are good 
examples of these systems. 
3. Other writing systems--French, English, and Japanese, for example--ask the 
brain to actualize and utilize the two biological potentials described. 
These sociocultural differences may have an important impact on the biology of 
the normal brain, of course, but also on clinical manifestations of learning disorders 
in oral and written language. In addition, with comparable cerebral lesions, these 
sociocultural differences will affect clinical manifestations of acquired diseases of 
language. 
APHASIA 
In the absence of wars, aphasia is often the result of cerebral vascular accidents. 
Normally, Broca's aphasia, characterized first by suppression of speech and followed 
by agrammatism, is more related to young patients, whereas the "jargonaphasia" of 
Wernicke is more associated with aging people. This assertion has been supported by 
a study of Joanette (Joanette et al., 1983), which showed that patients with Broca'a 
aphasia were 45 to 55 years old and patients with Wernicke's aphasia were 55 to 65 
years old. For some people, this discrepancy can be the result of cerebral arterial 
changes induced by the aging process, thus to the topography of cerebral vascular 
accidents (Benson, 1978). This interpretation suggests that Broca's aphasia is always 
the result of a dysfunction of Broca's area and Wernicke's aphasia is always the result 
of a dysfunction of Wernicke's area. 

24 
Andr~-Roch Lecours and Martine Simard 
However, it is now known that a lesion of Wernicke's area can produce a semiology 
of Broca's type when it happens in a 4-year-old child, for example. It is also known 
that the same lesion can induce clinical manifestations of a conduction aphasia in a 
24-year-old individual, for example. Again, it is a well-known fact that a lesion of 
Wernicke's area is often the cause of Wernicke's aphasia later in life. Finally, linguistic 
characteristics of "jargonaphasia" might not be the same if found in an old or in a 
very old patient. A progressive subcorticalization of biological language procedures, 
appearing when these procedures become more mechanical, has been suggested as the 
cause of variations occurring with age in the semiology of aphasia (Benson, 1978). 
Although this hypothesis is very interesting, it has never been tested. All these clinical 
changes related to the aging process and observed following similarly localized lesions 
allow an important deduction: the functional lateralization of language, together with 
the functional specialization of components of the area of language, occur progres- 
sively, over a long period. 
Also, the total, or partial, recovery of language capacities following stabilized ce- 
rebral lesions in old people as well as young adults and children is possible and can 
be very spectacular, especially in children. Sometimes, it has been hypothesized, this 
recovery is assumed by the right hemisphere in right-handed individuals. All these 
clinical data refer to the notion of a "genetic potential of replacement." 
CONCLUSION 
It seems beyond doubt now that the ontogenesis of the human brain and language 
lasts as long as the brain remains healthy. In other words, it ends with death. To a 
certain extent, sociocultural factors mold the ontogenesis of language and influence 
the evolution of cerebral biology. This point of view allows the possibility of an 
ontogenetic recovery, at least for some individuals, and even late in life.

Historical observations of disorders of language have been reported in Pharaonic med- 
ical papyrus texts circa 3000 B.C., a Hittite cuneiform tablet text circa 1500 B.C., the 
Hippocratic corpus circa 400 B.C., Latin texts circa the first century A.D., Latin texts 
in the Middle Ages (10th to the 14th century), Renaissance texts such as the Schenck 
compendium of 1558, various 17th-century texts such as Schmidt and Rommel and 
18th-century ones such as the Wepfer compendium of 1727. The early 19th-century 
phrenological contributions of Gall, Spurzheim, and Hood, as well as the more ortho- 
dox medical work of Lallemand, Bouillaud, Lordat, and Dax, inaugurated a period of 
intense interest in the brain localization of language functions, culminating in the 
classic work of Broca, Meynert, Wernicke, Bastian, Jackson, and others during the 
late 19th century. Although questioned on occasion by holistic views (Head, Gold- 
stein), the localization model persevered until, by the second half of the 20th century, 
classical neurolinguistics became firmly entrenched in both clinical and experimental 
neuroscience research. A glance at the cover of the third edition of Kandel, Schwartz, 
and Jessell's 1991 textbook, Principles of Neural Science, will suffice to support this 
contention.

The most durable model of functional brain localization so far has been the Me- 
dieval Cell Doctrine. Derived originally from ideas of Herophilus (c. 270 B.C.) and 
Erasistratus (c. 260 B.C.), Medieval Cell Doctrine, and its particular variant, ventricular 
theory, were developed by Galen (130-200), the church fathers Nemesius (c. 400), 
Posidonius (c. 370), and Saint Augustine (354-430), with additional Arab contribu- 
tions, particularly from Avicenna (980-1037). Ventricular theory was a model based 
on fluids and fluid flow for the apparent reason that thoughtful early scientists realized 
that something in the brain must move around in order to accomplish brain functionsw 
something passes from sense organs to effectors, and the "animal spirits" were as 
good a candidate as any available. It was sufficiently entrenched to have endured well 
into the 17th century--for example, in the hydraulic model of brain function advo- 
cated by Descartes (1596-1650). Certain principles of Medieval Cell Doctrine and 
ventricular theory (e.g., modular functions localized in different brain regions, as well 
as other vestiges of this two-millenia-old idea) remain as features of every model of 
brain function up to those of contemporary cognitive neuroscience. 
From the 1 lth century through the Renaissance, one finds textual discussions usu- 
ally in the form of neuropsychological case reports as well as graphic representations 
of Medieval Cell Doctrine and ventricular theory. Diagrams from the Middle Ages 
were typically crude and childlike, whereas those from the Renaissance period were 
often ornate works of art in their own right. These studies typically, although not 
invariably, accepted the standard model that placed memory in the third ventricle; the 
authors then "fit" the lesion evidence from brain-damaged subjects to that model. 
Language, or, more precisely, speech output, was also situated in the third cell or 
ventricle, an association that may have originated from Galen's belief that motor func- 
tions were a property of the cerebellum. The psychological link between memory and 
language may have been the cause or the result of a conception of memory as verbal 
memory; whichever, it is clear that they were so closely connected that memory 
disorders were interpreted as language disorders and vice versa. For example, consider 
this case from an 1 l th-century manuscript: Guillaume de Conches (1080-1150) re- 
ported that Solinus had spoken of a man who suffered traumatic injury to the last cell 
of the brain and who fell into an amnesia so profound that he had forgotten his own 
name. Many of these cases were compiled by Johannes Schenck (1584) and Johannes 
Wepfer (1727), both of whom are discussed in this chapter. Others are compiled in 
Jules Soury, Le systbme Nerveux Central (1899). 
Eventually, the overt form of Medieval Cell Doctrine and ventricular theory fell 
by the wayside, the demise beginning in the 17th century, as some of its key com- 
ponents (e.g., animal spirits flowing through hollow nerves or between empty ventri- 
cles) were challenged by both experimental and theoretical arguments. However, other 
aspects of the model--for example, the concepts of a modular functional localization, 
of information flow, of the close links between memory, language, and motor function, 
and the idea that memories are stored images--were not only never challenged but 
seem to have become absorbed into post-Renaissance models of brain function. 
From at least the 16th century, a correlation between language disorders and par- 
ticular cerebral lesions (rather than "ventricular," or simply generally "in the brain") 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics

has been recognized. The late-Renaissance physician Johannes Schenck von Grafen- 
berg (1530-1598) published Observationes medicae de capite humano in 1584; it is 
a treasure of neuropsychological observations including many observations on lan- 
guage disorders. It includes contributions from 20 Greek, 5 classic Latin, 11 medieval 
Arabic and Jewish, 37 medieval Latin, 292 recent Latin, and 139 classic nonmedical 
authors, as well as 64 unpublished cases reported by Schenck's contemporaries. His 
encyclopedic collection of clinical information, all with an explicit bibliographic ci- 
tation, has no counterpart in its time. At least 16 of Schenck's observations mention 
symptoms of language disorders. Although some case descriptions are superficial, 
many include quite explicit observations, showing that neurolinguistic knowledge was 
in fact more advanced than one might have believed. Armand Trousseau, a contem- 
porary of Broca, cited Schenck as an early physician who appreciated the essential 
nature of aphasia. A sampling of Schenck's cases (see Luzzatti & Whitaker [1996a]) 
illustrates the level of description in this early neurolinguistic work. Reporting a 14th- 
century case from Gentile da Foligno and a 16th-century case from Cristobal de Vega, 
Schenck notes the selective loss of the alphabet and object names, accompanied by 
loss of reading and writing. Another 16th-century case from Tertius Damianus reports 
that a patient studied his letters again, as an effort at rehabilitation. Schenck recorded 
an impressive 16th-century description by Conrad Lycosthenes of his own right hemi- 
plegia and aphasia, described as a loss of voice. The inability to speak lasted 12 days 
and the severe motor deficits lasted 3 months. Lycosthenes had even lost rote- 
memorized passages such as the Mass but had retained internal language and thinking; 
he was able to communicate by pointing, with his left hand, to letters in sequence to 
form words. Evidently, one of his friends had hit upon the idea of writing the alphabet 
down on a board as a communication aid. Citing Jakob Oethaeus, Schenck observes 
that the tongue may retain its motor functions when word memories have been lost, 
thus establishing quite early the dissociation between articulatory control and language 
production. Clearly, the Renaissance legacy to the 17th century's Age of Reason and 
scientific discovery was considerable insofar as neurolinguistics is concerned. 
1-2. A PERIOD OF TRANSITION: THE 17TH 
AND 18TH CENTURIES 
Johannes Jakob Wepfer (1620-1695), was an acquaintance of Thomas Willis and, 
although less well known than Schenck, was in fact one of the most important "neu- 
rologists" of the 17th century. He authored several papers and books; the one relevant 
to our interests is Observationes medico-practicae de affectionis capitis internis & 
externis, which was written around 1690 but only available in a posthumously pub- 
lished version of 1727. The book is notable for its accuracy, colorful clinical descrip- 
tions, and systematic organization. In observation 98, "loss of memory," Wepfer 
describes a transient language disorder with selective impairment of proper names, 
accompanied by a syntactic disorder; no acalculia nor other neuropsychological defi- 
cits were observed. The following is translated and paraphrased from the Latin: 

30 
Harry A. Whitaker 
A 53-year-old man returning from a walk vomited several times. He spoke both in Latin 
and German, but his words did not relate to the topic of conversation, nor were they answers 
to questions put to him. He continuously repeated the same utterances, stuck on the pro- 
nunciations of words, and frequently complained that he could not express his thoughts in 
words. A month later he suddenly forgot all names, even his own. He could not name any 
object, neither in Latin nor in German. He gave the impression that he was able to recognise 
objects and people but the words he uttered were alien and incoherent. After one more 
month, his memory was almost completely restored; his faculty of hearing and repeating 
was adequate and he could count, add, subtract and divide without error. Occasionally, he 
could not find the proper names of a person or a place as quickly as usual and from time 
to time he could not find some of the little words of the sentence. He is able read again and 
writes full texts without hesitation. His faculty of judgement is normal and he was able to 
fulfill his duties as before. When he was talking, I could observe him from time to time 
violate syntactic rules and, against the structure of German sentences, he would antepose 
one word to another [word-order errors] and sometimes he could not complete some little 
word [inflectional morphology errors]. In general, he recognised his errors and corrected 
them. (Luzzatti & Whitaker, 1996a, pp. 161-162) 
In addition to its interest as an early study of agrammatism, Wepfer's case is also 
exemplary of most, but not all, classical aphasia research on grammatical or syntactic 
disorders up until the 1970s: a descriptive summary of the omission or misuse of 
function words or inflections in spontaneous or elicited speech samples of patients 
with an expressive aphasia. It is exemplary as well as an analysis that made no attempt 
to explain the disorder but rather to describe it, a tradition in neuropsychology that 
still has its advocates. Wepfer's observation 102, a loss of memory followed by mel- 
ancholia, is instructive for the neuropsychological insight: 
A most reverend 44-year-old cleric sat in judgement on a controversy proposed by a peasant; 
however, when he tried to express his judgement, he could not find the words he wanted to 
communicate his thoughts. From that moment on, he lost his memory so much that he no 
longer was able to call the onlooker by his name nor he could name any object. He clearly 
saw the colours and features of objects and drawings presented to him, but he could neither 
read nor combine letters. All his remaining outward and inner sensations were normal. He 
recognised his loss of memory and the errors he made while speaking. There was no trace 
of paralysis; he could pronounce every letter, even the R. The site of suffering is neither in 
any nerve pertaining to both types of sensation, because he hears, sees, tastes, etc., nor in 
the nerve subserving speech, because he can pronounce all sounds, even the R, nor in the 
brain stem or spinal cord, because there is no trace of movement disorder. It seems to be 
located in that part of the brain where the images of objects are organised. These may be 
retrieved, as from a store, and, when required, supplied by means of the mnestic faculty. 
What part of the brain this might in fact be, cannot be defined, but clearly it is not an 
involvement of the entire brain, because the patient is not drowsy, and has lost neither his 
ingenuity nor his understanding. (Luzzatti & Whitaker, 1996a, p. 162) 
Compared to the similar collection (organization and focus) of clinical cases compiled 
by Schenck, Wepfer's cases seem to have been more carefully selected; many were 
followed by an autopsy description, and the etiological-pathogenic commentary is 
quite advanced in relation to the zeitgeist of the 17th century, particularly in com- 
parison with Wepfer's contemporary Thomas Willis. Wepfer is arguably the first sci- 
entist to discuss the nature of cognitive functions using a modern neuropsychological 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
31 
approach. To our knowledge, he was the first to consistently report the side of lesion 
and the presence or absence of aphasia, although he does not overtly express the 
relation between language disorder and left hemisphere lesions, despite the fact that 
he often wrote, paralisys dextri lateris, cum loquelae impedimentum. Perhaps the 
cultural-philosophical milieu in which Wepfer was working did not allow him to 
understand the relevance of his own observations, or perhaps his silence on the matter 
of hemispheric asymmetry was out of concern for an unwelcome reception by the 
church. Galileo had been accused less than 30 years earlier and the squares of Europe 
still smelled of the stakes of the Inquisition. 
Other 17th-century neurolinguistic reports worth mentioning include one by Johann 
Schmidt (1624-1690), a case of severe fluent paraphasia with right hemiparesis; the 
patient showed good recovery of oral language and agraphia, but not for his reading 
disorders. 
A leading citizen among us, Nicholas Cambier, an old man of 65 years, was seized with a 
very severe attack of apoplexy which all his attendants feared would lead to his death .... 
Upon his return home, it was evident that his right side was paralyzed and that he had 
difficulty in speaking. He muttered a good deal but was incapable of expressing the feelings 
of his mind; he substituted one word for another so that his attendants had difficulty in 
determining what he wanted .... 
He could not read written characters, much less combine 
them in any way. He did not know a single letter nor could he distinguish one from another. 
But it is remarkable that, if some name were given to him to be written, he could write it 
readily, spelling it correctly. However, he could not read what he had written even though 
it was in his own hand. Nor could he distinguish or identify the characters. For if he were 
asked what letter this or that was or how the letters had been combined, he could answer 
only by chance or through his habit of writing .... 
No teaching or guidance was successful 
in inculcating recognition of letters in him. It was otherwise with a certain stone cutter in 
our country. Wilhelm Richter came to see me after his apoplexy receded because he was 
not able to read at all or to recognize letters. However, he learned the alphabetic elements 
of the language again in a short time. He then combined them and attained perfection in his 
reading. (Benton & Joynt, 1960, p. 209) 
Another 17th-century report is Peter Rommel's (1643-1708) 1682 study of a patient 
whose spontaneous output was reduced to a few automatisms, but serial speech, 
prayers, and comprehension were preserved (Benton & Joynt, 1960, pp. 209-210). 
Considering the cases by Schmidt, Rommel, Schenck, and Wepfer, it is clear that 
scientists of the 16th and 17th centuries were able to clearly distinguish language 
disorders from general cognitive deficits, production versus comprehension deficits, 
lexical from sound or letter errors, and both syntactic and morphological impairments. 
Although the neuropsychological modeling needed to complete these analyses did not 
come until the beginning of the 19th century, the 17th century also witnessed a fair 
degree of progress on the neuroanatomical front. For example: 
1. Experimental brain research flourished, as seen in more accurate dissections, 
more careful observations, and comparisons of brains of different species, 
while ventricular theory was being replaced by models that localized 
functions to the brain substance. Nicolaus Steno (a.k.a. Niels Stensen [1638- 
1686]) could be regarded as a transition figure; he is remembered for his 

32 
Harry A. Whitaker 
. 
Discourse on the Brain (1669), which provides some evidence of the state of 
neuropsychology in the 17th century. Steno was convinced that wherever 
fibers are found in the brain, they maintain a certain pattern among 
themselves, of greater or lesser complexity according to the functions for 
which they are intended. His comments on the brain's white matter should be 
interpreted as prefiguring David Hartley's ideas of functional specificity and 
modularity (see Aubert & Whitaker, 1996). 
More systematic clinico-pathological observations of memory disorders and 
language disorders, with frequent reports of the co-occurrence of aphasia with 
right-sided paralysis, accompany the first formal teaching of clinical- 
pathological correlations for the purpose of determining the causes of disease 
(Boerhaave), to be later developed by Morgagni in the 18th century. 
Early ideas of domain specificity of functions in the brain were further 
developed in the work of David Hartley in the 18th century, incorporating 
Isaac Newton's vibration model of nerve function; Newton's model depended 
on the view that nerves were solid, not hollow. The Renaissance view that 
nerves transmit information to and from the brain was retained, but the idea 
of encoding of information--different vibrations for different ideas--was 
added. 
1-3. LOCALIZATION 
COMES 
OF AGE: 
FRANZ JOSEPH GALL AND HIS TIMES 
Whatever else may be said of the 18th century, it is clear that by its end, medicine 
had clearly accepted the idea of the discrete localization of functions in the brain (or, 
in the vernacular of the time, faculties; cf. the philosophy of Thomas Reid). Charles 
Bonnet (1720-1792) a Swiss naturalist and philosopher approvingly cited by Franz 
Joseph Gall, authored books on botany as well as zoology; Bonnet's psychological 
ideas were close to those of l~tienne Bonnot de Condillac (1715-1780), a leading 
exponent of French sensationalism. Bonnet believed that every faculty--sensitive, 
moral, or intellectual--is connected in the brain to a specific bundle of fibers. Ac- 
cording to Bonnet, every faculty has its own laws that determine its mode of action; 
not only does every faculty have its own fasciculus of fibers in the brain, but every 
word had its own fiber in the brain. Not only is this directly reminiscent of David 
Hartley's (1705-1757) neuropsychology (see Aubert & Whitaker, 1996), but it also 
harks back to Rend Descartes's model of brain function (see Smith, in press) and 
prefigures Johannes Mueller's doctrine of specific nerve energies. In light of these 
ideas from the 17th and 18th centuries, Gall's craniology (organology), or faculty 
neuropsychology, seems to be a logical if somewhat fanciful development. Much has 
been written about Franz Joseph Gall's (1758-1828) contribution to neuroscience, but 
not a lot is known about the roots of his ideas. Christine Grou, in her unpublished 
doctoral dissertation, demonstrated a close parallel between the faculty psychology of 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
33 
Thomas Reid (1710-1796) and the faculties of Gall and Spurzheim, and also a com- 
monality between the hundreds of physiognomic characteristics proposed by Johann 
Kaspar Lavater (1741-1801) and the phrenological faculties (Grou & Whitaker, 1992). 
Gall's idea that growth patterns of the cortex, hypertrophy or atrophy, would impress 
themselves on the inner table of the skull and thus be "readable" as bumps on the 
skull was directly borrowed from Lavater. The great 18th-century naturalist Charles 
Bonnet proposed a vibration-based theory of memory reminiscent of Hartley; Bonnet 
also proposed a doctrine of localization of function in the brain that clearly influenced 
Gall, as the latter cites the former in several of his books. Nonetheless, the details of 
Gall's indebtedness to these 18th-century scientists remain to be elucidated. Gall had 
theoretically anticipated a division between two aspects of the language function and 
had proposed two distinct localizations. On a skull, shelved in the University of Vienna 
Medical Museum, Gall inscribed in an elegant penmanship the various faculties of 
the mind; in the "left" bony orbit only (what an extraordinary coincidence! but of 
course he was likely right-handed) he wrote Wortsinn, the memory for words or the 
lexical component of language, and just above it, Sprachsinn, the motoric component 
or the faculty of spoken language. Although Gall believed that the clinico-pathological 
correlation of brain lesions to aphasic disturbances could furnish evidence in support 
of his model, and although he did in fact study two cases of sword injury to the frontal 
lobe referred by Napol6on's surgeon, Dominique Larrey, Gall himself evinced little 
direct interest in clincal neurolinguistic cases. 
On the other hand, the phrenological model (Spurzheim's terminology) based on 
Gall's ideas served to preserve ideas of brain-language correlations through the first 
two-thirds of the 19th century, in the hands of such stalwarts of medicine as Alexander 
Hood and Jean Baptiste Bouillaud. We have worked out some of the connections 
between craniology-phrenology and the development of neuropsychology in the period 
from 1820 to 1860 and we have also analyzed how the early phrenologists helped to 
found the doctrine of the clinico-pathological correlation of language impairments. 
Gall's argument that a well-developed language faculty causes a protuberance of the 
inferior, anterior frontal lobe, which in turn would make the eye sockets shallowm 
thus, folks with high verbal skills were said to have "cow's eyes"mwas not success- 
fully challenged by the scientific community, even though in fact it should be regarded 
as a scientific mistake, an error in reasoning using his own craniological method. It 
was well known at the time that the backside of the eye sockets do not abut the frontal 
lobe~a great deal of sinus cavity lies between the two, and therefore it is quite 
impossible that a frontal brain bump could impinge upon the eye sockets. Curiously, 
from the standpoint of "good science," Bouillaud not only accepted this localization 
but championed it unceasingly right up to 1861 when Broca's publication seemed to 
vindicate Gall's model. Evidently, it was the accumulating evidence that frontal lesions 
typically led to speech disturbances, documented by Lallemand, Bouillaud, and others 
from the 1820s on, that kept the phrenological language model alive until the great 
paradigm shift of the 1870s. But first, let us consider what the practicing phrenologists 
had to say.

The question is, does phrenology, at least in the first half of the 19th century, merit 
the sort of scathing criticism it is often given? For example, Garrison (1929) said, 
"exploited by quacks and charlatans, phrenology soon became an object of derision 
among scientific men" (p. 539). Considering Johann Gaspar Spurzheim's (1776-1832) 
intellectual legacy, one might usefully evaluate this historical judgment by looking at 
what practicing phrenologists actually did; one way of doing that is to look at what 
was published in their own journal. The Phrenological Journal and Miscellany (PJM), 
the house organ of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society, was founded in 1820 by 
George Combe (1788-1858) following his earlier indoctrination into the ways of phre- 
nology by Spurzheim. In 1824, an obscure phrenologist and medical practitioner from 
Scotland, Alexander Hood, published in PJM a remarkable case history of one Adam 
M'Conochie, who, subsequent to a CVA in the left frontal lobe, had become what by 
the end of the century would be called a "Broca's aphasic." Hood's paper may oc- 
casion some historical interest on several counts: its contribution to the technique of 
clinico-pathological correlation, its indebtedness to the phrenological movement in 
Scotland launched by Spurzheim and Combe, its use of aphasic data to argue for both 
the modularity and the fractionation of language, and, of course, the fact that the date 
in its titlemJuly 24, 1824--was the very one on which Pierre Paul Broca was born 
(Hood, 1824). 
Hood discussed the case of Adam M'Conochie, a 48-year-old gardener from Dank- 
eith, Scotland, who had evidently sustained a mild left hemisphere CVA the morning 
of May 31, 1824. Hood first saw the patient that same afternoon and took a brief 
history from his wife. M'Conochie rose from bed later than customary that morning 
and began looking for something he could not name. For a while his wife could not 
understand what he was searching for; eventually it turned out to be his socks. Nothing 
unusual was reported about M'Conochie's ability to dress himself. His wife did notice 
"something peculiar in his manner and by a striking deficiency that she observed in 
the use which he made of language, which in fact was limited to a few words" (p. 
82). M'Conochie, plainly more concerned about his duty to his master than his recent 
stroke, proceeded to gravel the walks around the house, while his wife contacted the 
steward to tell him of her husband's problem. The wife, the steward, and finally the 
factor were needed to persuade M'Conochie to go home and send for medical assis- 
tance. When Hood first entered the room, McConochie was dozing in bed, perspiring 
a great deal. He quickly got out of bed as though nothing was wrong; his pulse was 
"natural, but the tongue was foul and the bowels were slow" (p. 82). 
Hood questioned him about his complaint and the state of his "feelings" but was 
unable to get a satisfactory response "on account of his utter inability to give a 
description in language of the state of his mind together with his internal feelings and 
sensations." To indicate where the problem lay, M'Conochie obligingly raised his left 
hand to the left side of his head (recall, of course, that the right hand was weak, if 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
35 
not actually paralyzed) and, pointing to the temple behind the angle of his eye, said 
there was "something about it." One can imagine Hood's excitement as an aphasic 
patient signaled the site for the organ of language as having a problem! After repeating 
the phrase "something about it" several times, M'Conochie said the word "rheuma- 
tism," signifying, as it was understood in that epoch, that his complaint was a rheu- 
matic affection of this part. He had no apparent difficulty in comprehending any 
question that was put to him but his answers were always such as these: "something 
about it," "plenty about it," "little about it," or "nothing about it" (p. 84), suggesting, 
in my opinion, not only an anomic impairment but equally the possible preservation 
of expressions of measure or quantity. When asked whether he had pain or uneasiness 
in his head, M'Conochie's answer was that there was "something about it." But when 
similar questions were put to him with respect to the chest and abdomen, he replied 
by saying, there was "nothing about it." A book was shown to him to see whether 
he could read; the only word that caught his attention and that he could name was 
"man." However, he was unable to say aloud the names of the three letters in "man." 
He was then asked whether he could read fluently prior to the present attack, to which 
he repled that he knew "plenty about it" and promptly brought Hood a volume of 
travels that he had lately been reading. When M'Conochie was asked to repeat the 
Lord's Prayer, his answer was, he "ken'd plenty about it" but this was all the infor- 
mation he could give concerning it or other rote verbal passages (p. 84). On June 14, 
M'Conochie continued to improve in reading, to which he applied himself assiduously; 
but Hood noted that there was apparently not quite so much improvement in his 
powers of conversation. The other symptoms remained nearly the same. By June 21 st 
Hood noted that his patient could now read tolerably well, with the exception of a 
few words that he could not pronounce accurately. M'Conochie could not, however, 
repeat a sentence or even a syllable of the Lord's Prayer, or any other portion of the 
sacred book with which he was formerly familiar. He moved his legs and arms with 
perfect facility and apparent vigor; he said his right hand was "dumb," though he 
probably meant "numb." On the whole, he was flat and spiritless, and thought himself 
little or no better (p. 85). Hood's July 2 observation was that M'Conochie had been 
rather melancholy; his right arm and leg were affected with weakness and irregular 
nervous action; he could read pretty well, but could not repeat anything that might 
have been committed to memory; there were still some words he could not pronounce, 
though there were much fewer than there had been three weeks earlier. A strong degree 
of excitement seemed to give him temporary command of a few words that he could 
not speak in his calmer moments (p. 85). For the entry of July 10, Hood noted that 
his patient's reading had not materially improved since the last report, but he could 
read verses much better, having obviously reacquired an extensive addition to his 
vocabulary. He could use both arms and hands equally well; Hood perceived little 
difference with regard to strength, but a striking difference with regard to sensation. 
However, when M'Conochie picked up something with his right hand, he often had 
to employ his left hand so as to enable him to judge accurately of the temperature of 
bodies. This day, for the first time by means of language, he was able to make himself 
intelligible with respect to the state of his feelings since the commencement 

36 
Harry A. Whitaker 
of his complaint. M'Conochie offered the comment to Hood that, when a book was 
previously given to him and he was asked to read, he had "numbered" the words, 
that is, spoken the words "one, two, three, four, five, six," and so on. Apparently, he 
fully comprehended the import of the actual words given as numbers, although he did 
not recollect how to pronounce or name them. (pp. 86-87) 
"At the end of his case report, given here in much of its detail so that the nature 
and progression of the symptoms can be appreciated, Hood turned to his observations 
on brain function. In this section, Hood included parts of the discussion of three other 
cases, reported earlier in the same journal. To quote him directly: 
An attentive perusal of these cases suggests some important reflections concerning the pa- 
thology of the brain .... 
[they] show to what an alarming extent this important organ may 
be injured without destroying life or the functions of health. It would neither be professional, 
nor philosophic, however, from a few remarkable cases, to infer that the brain is of little 
consideration in the animal economy, or totally unconnected with the operations of the mind. 
Were the patients in all such cases capable of giving a distinct and accurate account of their 
feelings and sensations, and the medical observer fully adequate to point out every deviation 
from the healthy condition of body and mind, much of our surprise would cease, and the 
apparent anomaly would disappear. (P. 88) 
"In the case McPherson, an iron penetrated one and a half to two inches into the 
brain in a transverse direction; there were no effects at first and the patient could walk 
about, eat, etc., until suppuration (infection) caused a confusion of intellect and a 
palsy on one side" (p. 88). "The patient showed an unusual degree of Timidity; indeed 
he was struck on the organ of Caution" (p. 89). 
"Case Morton fell from a coach and fractured his skull. The fracture extended over 
the ear from the temporal bone into the parietal and occipital bones; the arm on the 
opposite side is still an inch smaller than the other one. Morton is much more irritable 
than before and not quite so capable of prosecuting any design which requires con- 
tinued and steady Perseverance" (p. 89) In reference to the sequelae of brain damage, 
Hood noted that although the parts heal up, they never acquire such a "perfect or- 
ganization" as that with which they were originally endowed. 
Hence it seems reasonable to suppose, that when a part of the brain, on which some moral 
or intellectual function depends, has suffered much from inflammation, or external violence, 
althought the part thus weakened or injured may perform the function or functions which 
depend upon it, in the ordinary states of the system, yet when the whole faculties are roused 
by intense feeling, or excited by intoxicating liquors, then will the organic lesion be evinced 
by corresponding derangement in the manifestations of intellect and feeling. (P. 89) 
For Case 3 Hood performed an autopsy on the brain of a woman who died and 
discovered a small spicula of bone in the dura mater on the upper part of the falx 
where it dips down between "the organs of Self-esteem." In addition, he found a 
small tumor growing from the dura mater, pressing upon the organ of Hope. He 
regarded both lesions as continuing sources of irritation of the brain, and explained 
the patient's impaired behavior prior to death in terms of the effects on these organs: 
Whatever may be thought of this attempt to reconcile the phenomena of the disease with 
the appearances on dissection, it was almost impossible for any one acquainted with the 
principles of the new doctrine on this subject, to omit observing the striking coincidence 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
37 
and apparent corroboration which Phrenology seems to receive from morbid anatomy. We 
have no faith in the doctrine of chance, and therefore cannot believe that the mental affection 
and morbid appearances after death, were the result of fortuitous circumstances. (R 91) 
As for Case 4 of M'Conochie, "the last of these cases is not without considerable 
interest, in as much as it unfolds to us the nature of that affection by which individuals 
sometimes suddenly lose the verbal recollection of almost every term in the language, 
without the ideas being lost, or the judgment impaired" (p. 91). In other words, Hood 
is arguing one may separate or fractionate two features of the organ for language, 
based on the evidence from this patient. Although the patient had forgotten in general 
the names of objects with which he was familiar, when the name of a thing was given 
in his hearing he was capable of recollecting it for a few seconds of time, so as to be 
able to pronounce it again; Hood notes that this is quite different with case R.W. This 
latter patient very often could not recollect the word long enough to enable him to 
pronounce it a second time, thereby demonstrating that the paralytic affection was 
more severe in this case than the other. 
Hood argues that the case of M'Conochie and the case of R.W. considered together 
make a most pointed analogy with respect to the phenomenon of language. One must 
bring a degree of credulity to the localization, of course; in Hood's terms, however, 
it was perfectly credible that a patient could indicate the site of a lesion by pointing 
to the spot on his head. In one of the two patients the pain "affected a much greater 
surface"; accordingly, the organ of language was not exclusively affected, for some 
of the muscles that assist in articulation were in a certain degree paralytic, from the 
impediment that was conspicuous in the pronunciation of some words. Hood also 
takes note of the loss of sensation on right side of face, numbness of the arm and 
particularly of the hand, without any loss of power of motion. Thus, to Hood, R.W. 
and M'Conochie "mutually illustrate each other." In R.W.'s case the paralytic affec- 
tion seemed to be confined exclusively to the organ of langauge; in M'Conochie's 
case, the organ of language was affected, though not quite so severely; however, the 
paralytic tendency (lesion) extended farther, involving some of the muscles concerned 
in articulation (p. 92). Hood says: M'Conochie's case, and more particularly R.W.'s, 
so often mentioned, go far to establish the individuality of the organ of Language, 
and to confirm the accuracy of the observations of the gentlemen who have discovered 
its place in the brain to be above and behind the socket of the eye" (p. 92). In sum, 
by comparing two different aphasic cases, Hood has fractionated the organ of language 
into one part directly controlling the articulatory muscles, another controlling verbal 
expression, and a third controlling the memory or ideas for wordsma remarkably 
prescient experimental conclusion, employing a theoretically coherent albeit implau- 
sible clinico-pathological correlation. Hood concluded with a homily: one needs to 
have a good theory before studying the brain so that the evidence of impaired function 
may be properly related to the elements of the theory. How true! In Hood's case, 
however, the "theory" is the map of the phrenological organs neatly painted on a 
plaster bust. In his own words: 
When therefore the mental phenomena, in any given case, indicate preternatural and dimin- 
ished function in a particular part or parts of the brain, and when dissection after death 

38

actually exhibits the organ or organs indicated in a diseased state, the nature of the evidence 
thus obtained is as conclusive, with regard to the accuracy of the mode of the investigation, 
as any demonstration in Euclid. (P. 94) 
1-5. FROM GALL TO BROCA: THE CONTRIBUTION 
OF JEAN 
BAPTISTE 
BOUILLAUD 
Franqois Broussais (1772-1838), one of the most prestigious physicians in France, had 
pronounced in favor of Gall's ideas, eventually offering a full course in phrenology 
to the medical students in Paris, the lessons of which were published in 1836 (Valentin, 
1988). Jean Baptiste Bouillaud (1796-1881), a leading cardiologist in France, also 
believed in phrenology, while most other recognized scientists had sided with Jean- 
Pierre Marie Flourens (1794-1867), the doctrine's most famous critic. After Brous- 
sais's death, Bouillaud became the major medical figure in France to support the 
concept of cerebral localization. Between the 1820s and the 1860s, Bouillaud gave 
several major presentations at the French Academy of Medicine meetings, defending 
the frontal lobe localization of language, and thus became the most important link 
between Gall and Broca. 
There has been a tendency for historians to jump from Bouillaud's 1825 paper to 
the Auburtin-Gratiolet-Broca discussion of 1861. One reason, as Clarke and O'Malley 
(1968) noted, for example, is that Bouillaud's views did not gain wide acceptance 
during the 3-decade interval in question; however, he was not by any means ignored. 
In the pages of various French Academy publications, Bouillaud debated the concept 
of cerebral localization with important clinical and experimental opponents such as 
Andral, Flourens, Pinel (ills), Cruveilhier, Lallemand, Rochoux, Rostan, and Castel. 
It seems evident that any medical researcher during this period of some 30 years was 
frequently confronted with the theory of cerebral localization, particularly that of lan- 
guage. It is also apparent that people were quite aware of the fact that if the proof of 
the localization of language were to be established, then the entire enterprise of cer- 
ebral localization would be viable and legitimate. 
Bouillaud's first publication on localization (1825) provided independent clinical 
evidence supporting Gall's theory of the frontal lobe localization for language. Al- 
though Bouillaud has been credited with having made the first observation of 'internal' 
and 'external' speech, or what he termed the "power of creating words as signs of 
our ideas and that of articulating these same words" (Harrington, 1987), we saw earlier 
that Hood deserves that recognition. However, Bouillaud's own words do sound much 
more like modern neurology: "the tongue and its related organs in the act of speech 
can be separately paralyzed, that is to say, without the other parts being affected 
simultaneously"; and, "the loss of speech depends now upon the loss of the memory 
of words, now upon the loss of the muscular movements by which speech is com- 
posed, or, what comes perhaps to the same thing, now upon a lesion of the gray matter 
and now upon that of the white matter of the anterior lobes" (McHenry, 1969, pp. 
490-491). It is not generally noted that Bouillaud did not uncritically accept Gall's 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
39 
theory: for example, he sided with Flourens against Gall on the matter of the role of 
the cerebellum and further agreed with Flourens that phrenology was a "pseudo- 
science." 
Although Bouillaud had somewhat distanced himself from phrenology per se, he 
maintained the truth of the theory of cerebral localization and in particular the frontal 
lobe localization for language. The following is based on a paper by Luzzatti and 
Whitaker (1996b). 
The purpose of Bouillaud's 1825 paper was to verify Gall's theory of the relation 
between loss of speech and a lesion of the frontal lobes; it summarizes the major 
issues concerning functional-anatomical correlation particularly for language. Bouil- 
laud discusses the motor control of language and its relation, on the one hand, to the 
motor control of nonlinguistic movements of the tongue and, on the other, to intelli- 
gence. After a brief introduction, Bouillaud vehemently attacks Flourens's skepticism 
about the hemispheric localization of motor functions. He next argues that even ac- 
cepting that the hemispheres control motor functions is insufficient because different 
parts of the brain control different kinds of movements. This is particularly clear for 
movements of the tongue and eye. Bouillaud claims first to be able to demonstrate 
that speech movements may be compromised separately from limb movements and 
second to demonstrate which part of the hemispheres is involved in the control of 
speech movements. To prove his first claim he states that two actions are functionally 
separate if they can be disrupted in isolation from each other, which is evident for 
three cases in which a severe speech disorder was not accompanied by any impairment 
of limb movement or by any defect of nonspeech tongue movements. Thus, speech 
has its own motor control center. 
Bouillaud then moves directly to the problem of identifying the area of the hemi- 
spheres responsible for speech motor control, following Gall's theory, the frontal 
lobes. Surgical lesions in animals cannot furnish evidence because animals do not 
have speech, nor can experimental lesions be carried out in humans. He defines the 
principle of a "necessary and sufficient condition" to test anatomo-functional corre- 
lations. If the frontal lobes are crucial for directing speech movements, two conditions 
must be satisfied: first, when frontal lobes are affected, speech must also be affected; 
second, when frontal lobes are spared, the same must be the case for speech move- 
ments. 
Bouillaud next describes a few positive and negative cases where the anatomo- 
clinical correlation actually corresponded to his expectations, and then he tests his 
hypothesis of the frontal lobe localization of speech using the neurological and neu- 
ropathological case studies reported in Claude-Franqois Lallemand's books (1820, 
1823), among others. He analyzed Lallemand's data using the above-described prin- 
ciple of positive and negative observations and claims that he obtained a full confir- 
mation of his theory both for the positive and for the negative observations. He even 
records his surprise that Lallemand and others did not come by themselves to the 
same conclusion, faced with such a clear evidence. 
Bouillaud differentiates between an "organ of articulated language" and "memory 
for words," which he considers as a secondary attribute, and argues that this is 

40 
Harry A. Whitaker 
different from Gall's view (however, recall that Gall had indeed separated word mem- 
ory from speech; it is not known whether Bouillaud was aware of Gall's distinction). 
Finally, Bouillaud suggests that the frontal lobes are the site of both these distinct 
faculties, the grey matter being the organ of verbal (memory) representations and the 
white matter the locus of speech motor output. Putting aside the question of priority 
between Gall, Hood, and Bouillaud, it should be emphasized that Bouillaud's descrip- 
tion is quite outstanding for a mainstream medical publication of this era. Neverthe- 
less, it is exceedingly curious that he could have based his model on Lallemand's 
data. Luzzatti and Whitaker (1996b) reanalyzed the Lallemand clinical cases and ar- 
rived at a quite different picture from that of Bouillaud. 
Claude-Franqois Lallemand described his cases in a series of "letters" (Lallemand, 
1820, 1823); it is from the first four letters that Bouillaud (1825) drew his conclusions. 
Of the 174 case descriptions, some subjects are poorly documented and thus unsuitable 
for our purpose; some had lesions outside the cerebral hemispheres proper (e.g., in 
the cerebellum, pons, or medulla). In a few cases, Lallemand provides a good clincal 
report but the pathology is missing or insufficient, and these cannot be used either. 
Of the remaining 63 usable cases, 33 have a right hemisphere lesion, 23 have a left 
hemisphere lesion, and 7 have bilateral lesions. 
The almost normal distribution of right and left hemisphere lesions, of course, 
showed a higher rate of aphasic/dysarthric cases within the LH group against a ma- 
jority of nonaphasic patients in the RH group (16 out of 23LH versus 13 out of 
33RH). The Chi-square is significant (p < .01). The results of the Luzzatti & Whitaker 
(1996b) analysis are even more impressive if one considers the location of the single 
lesions in the two hemispheres. Consider first the 33 cases with a right hemisphere 
lesion only: in agreement with Bouillaud's predictions, there are 2 frontal cases with 
speech or language disorders and 16 nonfrontal cases without speech disorders. How- 
ever, there are also 4 frontal cases without speech deficits and 5 cases with speech 
deficits but a lesion outside the frontal lobe. The data for the left hemisphere lesions 
are equally problematic for Bouillaud: in agreement with his predictions, there are 7 
frontal cases with speech or language disorders, 4 nonfrontal cases without speech 
disorders, and no frontal cases without a speech disorder. Unfortunately, there are also 
7 cases with speech deficits but a lesion outside the frontal lobe. Today, of course, 
we know the reason why. Summing up the left and right hemisphere lesions, we find 
that 15 out of 40 patients with a localized unilateral lesion (38%) did not fit Bouillaud's 
prediction. The question that arises is why did Bouillaud come to such an inaccurate 
conclusion? It is difficult to believe that this could have been due to differences in 
how we interpret these cases. Consider, for example, that, in a note added to the 1834 
edition of his book, Lallemand made an ironic comment directed to Bouillaud, point- 
ing out that the sites of the lesions in these cases are incompatible with Bouillaud's 
theory. When we looked at Bouillaud's text and compared it to the case from Lalle- 
mand that he purported to be describing, it was clear that he had changed the meaning 
in some cases or just ignored other cases. 
For instance, Bouillaud's observation 7 (Lallemand's Letter 1, Case 11), a 70-year- 
old male presenting with a language disorder a few days after a traumatic head injury, 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
41 
had multiple lesions involving the frontal lobe and the left posterior part of the brain; 
Bouillaud refers to this case as only a frontal lesion by reporting only the first part 
of Lallemand's text. Unfortunately, the only reasonable explanation is that Bouillaud 
purposefully manipulated Lallemand's case descriptions, that he committed scientific 
fraud. 
Whatever the reason that brought Bouillaud to misrepresent the experimental dem- 
onstration of his theory, it is interesting to keep in mind the scientific cultural frame 
in which Bouillaud developed his hypothesis on localization of language. Besides his 
general model of a dual aspect of language and its motor control--we might now say, 
between articulation and language representations--it is quite surprising how little 
interest Bouillaud showed in the "intellectual" aspect of language. Such a neglect 
appears to characterize almost all French neuropsychological studies on language 
until near the end of the 19th century, including Broca himself. We suggest that this 
approach to brain-language interaction is largely due to the influence of the Gall- 
Flourens dispute over phrenology and Flourens's overwhelming interest in motor 
control. 
1-6. FROM GALL TO BROCA: DAY-TO-DAY 
MEDICAL WORK 
Pierre Paul Broca (1824-1880) focused on disorders of speech production (langage 
articuld) because, before the 1860s, one did not discuss disorders of language "com- 
prehension." Language was constructed as speech output and the rest, what could 
have been discussed under the rubric "comprehension," fell under the notion of 
"mind," which at the time was in the province of philosophy, religion, and nascent 
psychiatry (the alienists). This, of course, had been tradition since the time of Galen; 
the primary difference was that the location had shifted from the third cell or ventricle, 
as in Medieval Cell Doctrine, to the frontal lobe, as in Gall's craniology, later phre- 
nology. 
From the 1820s on, both orthodox medical and phrenological medical journals were 
filled with case reports of expressive language impairments arising from stroke and 
trauma, with and without autopsy evidence of the involvement or lack of involvement 
of the frontal lobes. That is to say, Gall's hypothesis that the frontal lobes are the seat 
of language was hotly debated for more than 40 years prior to Broca's famous articles. 
The publications of Bouillaud, Lallemand, Marc Dax, and Jacques Lordat are among 
the more familiar; however, there were dozens of obscure medical practitioners pub- 
lishing these reports, such as Alexander Hood's case studies, which we have already 
discussed. Another typical example comes from the journal The Lancet (Vol. 1, 1848). 
A case report on page 260, written by T. E. Tebay, Esq., who was the resident medical 
officer of the Westminster Hospital, discusses a case of cerebritis, hemiplegia of the 
right side with a defective memory for words. The patient died on the twenty-fourth 
day after admission; the autopsy reported a gelatinous softening of the left anterior 
cerebral lobe. The case details are as follows: 

42 
Harry A. Whitaker 
J.W. male, 35 y.o. (admitted March 10) speechless, could sit in his chair and protrude his 
tongue or move his hand when desired to do so. Sensation on the body surface is unimpaired, 
the right arm is powerless, the right leg dragged when walking (progression) but the tongue 
protruded straight. There is no facial paralysis, the mental faculties appeared lost to a con- 
siderable extent. By 10:00 A.M. patient appeared to have recovered mental faculties to a 
considerable extent but cannot give utterance to his wishes for want of words, which he 
strives in vain to recal [sic]. His articulation of some words is tolerably distinct when he 
can recal [sic] them. March 12th: patient is much the same; he appears to have almost entirely 
recovered his intellectual powers with the exception that his memory for words continues 
very defective. March 14th: the hemiplegia is diminishing. March 28th: motor power in arm 
is better restored than in leg and recollection of words is returning gradually. March 29th: 
there were several momentary attacks of tetanic rigidity. March 30th: there were upwards 
of 20 such attacks. April 3rd: frequent recurrence of attacks of tetanic rigidity (all affecting 
right side of body as before) were attended by persistent coma. During these attacks the 
facial muscles are very distorted; the right angle of mouth is drawn downwards and outwards. 
April 4th: coma and convulsions continue (attended with groaning); patient died at 4 P.M. 
The autopsy report showed a cavity of the size of a small nutmeg, containing half a tea- 
spoonfull of yellowish sero-purulent fluid in the left posterior lobe, one inch from the pos- 
terior surface of the cerebrum and nearly on a level with the corpus callosum; the cerebral 
substance around was natural in appearance but slightly softened. The membranes covering 
the anterior lobe, half an inch above the orbit, bore a depressed and puckered appearance 
over a space of one inch square, owing to a loss of cerebral substance at that part. The 
cerebral substance (of the anterior lobe) being, to the depth of half an inch or more, greatly 
softened, partially absorbed and almost converted into a fluid yellowish jelly. The opposite 
hemisphere (i.e. the right) appeared normal. 
From cases like thesemand there were literally hundreds of them in the weekly, 
monthly, and quarterly medical journals from Europe and America--it is clear that 
the average practicing medical doctor was well aware of the frontal lobe speech center 
hypothesis. Cases with lesions outside of the frontal lobe, with aphasia, were taken 
as evidence against the speech localization hypothesis, and not as data for different 
kinds of aphasia. 
What, then, to make of Pierre Paul Broca's series of papers on "aphemia" pub- 
lished in 1861, 1863, and 1865? We already know that Broca's papers are no longer 
recognized as the first research to provide empirical evidence for the lateralization of 
language to the left hemisphere. Marc Dax (1770-1837) read a statement to his medical 
colleagues in Montpellier, France, in July 1836 in which 40 cases with clinico- 
anatomic correlation showing the role of the left hemisphere in language were sum- 
marized. Recent historical research suggests that Broca's papers were also not the first 
to demonstrate the localization Of a language function to a specific site in the frontal 
lobe, nor were they even the first to do so using an acceptable scientific paradigm, 
that of clinico-pathological correlation. Perhaps the best that can be said is that Broca 
was in the right place at the right time. Historical analyses can help us realize that 
our neurolinguistic models (a) have precursors, (b) are contextually influenced by the 
scientific milieu, and (c) are relative to the assumptions and constraints of the para- 
digms we happen to currently accept. 
Establishing priority is typically a judgmental enterprise. Consider the following 
quote from David Caplan (1987, p. 46): "The 1861 paper by Broca is the first truly 
scientific paper on language-brain relationships." Caplan supports this conclusion 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
43 
(here, as elsewhere, Caplan successfully integrates historical with contemporary re- 
search) with three claims: that Broca presented a detailed case history with "excellent 
gross anatomical findings at autopsy," that Broca had the insight that the gross brain 
convolutions are constant anatomical features that may be related to particular psy- 
chological functions, and that Broca's primary conclusion that expressive speech de- 
pends on a small part of the inferior frontal gyrus was a good first approximation, 
which we generally accept today. Priority in the case of Broca is a matter of scholarly 
judgment. Alexander Hood, in 1824, did a better job of analyzing expressive language 
functions and correlating them to a frontal lobe localization; Hood postulated a lexical- 
phonological level, a phonological-articulatory level, and a motoric level for expres- 
sive speech, based on the speech and language impairments he observed in stroke 
patients. Excellent clinical-pathological studies of aphasic cases are found in the 17th- 
century studies of Wepfer (1727, p. 14), studies that are so good one may verify the 
left hemisphere localization of language from them. Lallemand (1820, 1823), Bouil- 
laud (1825), and others long before Broca published detailed autopsy reports of pa- 
tients with aphasia. In this context, one might also consider the fact that the classical 
neuroanatomists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (i.e., after Broca) virtually 
abandoned the possibility of systematically describing gyral geography because of its 
evident individual variability, a variability that currently plagues PET researchers who 
need to coregister sites of PET activation with MRI images in order to compare results 
across subjects. And, finally, we are obliged to mention the fact that the autopsy of 
Broca's 1861 patient actually demonstrated an extremely large left hemisphere lesion 
encompassing frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex. Broca "inferred" that the third 
inferior frontal part of this large lesion was the one responsible for the patient's 
aphemia, by estimating the degree of necrosis and trying to back-correlate that with 
the patient's medical history. 
What is important to appreciate here is that it is not a question of disputing the 
claims of priority, nor even the facts themselves, but of how one chooses to interpret 
the historical record. The view I prefer is (a) that Broca inherited a tradition of clinical- 
pathological correlation that already presupposed that different brain regions had dif- 
ferent functions, (b) that Broca was theoretically constrained by a construct of lan- 
guage that placed psychological preeminence on speech production, (c) that Broca 
was immediately challenged and certainly intrigued by the debates involving many 
famous members of the French scientific community (e.g., Gratiolet, Bouillaud, Au- 
burtin, and Flourens) concerning the role of the frontal lobe in speech and therefore 
was predisposed to see the age of that lesion as having a significant frontal component, 
and, most important, (d) that Broca had the position, power, and prestige to take 
advantage of his serendipitous clinical observation. 
1-7. DIAGRAMMING 
AND LOCALIZING 
IN THE 
LATE 
19TH CENTURY 
Although some historical "facts" are subject to interpretation, as we have just seen, 
some are just plain right or wrong, and, it behooves us to get it right. Consider the 

44 
Harry A. Whitaker 
following opinion from Morton (1984): "We have a number of lessons to learn from 
history. If we are lucky we can avoid making the same mistakes as thinkers in the 
past." A mistake made by the "diagram-makers," according to Morton, was to con- 
fuse the goal of representing the elements of language processing in the brain with 
the goal of determining the localization in the brain of these elements (p. 40). Henry 
Head (1926) held a similar view; in fact, Head coined the term "diagram-makers" to 
refer to the classical aphasiologists of the late 19th century. 
Let us examine Morton's (1984) claim: did the diagram-makers confuse the psy- 
chological (processing elements) with the neurological (localization of elements) goals 
of their neurolinguistic enterprise, as Morton asserts? Baginsky (1871; see Jarema, 
1993), one of the diagram-makers discussed by Morton, believed that he had based 
his model on the "physiology of speech formation"; Baginsky did not stipulate spe- 
cific anatomic sites for each of his language "centers," maintaining that "we do not 
yet have a precise conceptualization" of this relationship (Jarema, 1993). Kussmaul, 
another diagram-maker discussed by Morton, claimed that his colleagues, particularly 
Wernicke, were mistaken in trying to localize the various speech centers to specific 
regions of the brain. Kussmaul was "acutely aware of the limitations of the locali- 
zationist approach to linguistic processes" (Jarema, 1993, p. 509); "extraordinarily 
removed from strictly anatomical and physiological considerations, Kussmaul the phy- 
sician achieves an understanding of the psychology of language in terms of the con- 
cepts which constitute the core of present day models, e.g. the distinction between 
various levels of representation.., their respective autonomy yet interconnection, 
and the notion of linguistic processes" (Jarema, 1993, p. 497). The same may be said 
of Elder (Whitaker, 1988) and Grasset (Dos Santos, Nespoulous, & Whitaker, in prep- 
aration), both mentioned by Morton, as well as of Bastian (Eling, 1994), who, though 
not discussed by Morton, was one of the best known of the British diagram-makers 
of the period. Eling (1994) remarked that, in general, characterizing the work of these 
classical aphasiologists with a few short statements and adjectives does not do justice 
to their careful analytic description and argumentation. It should be mentioned that 
Morton's questionable analysis of the model-theoretic assumptions of Baginsky, Kuss- 
maul, Elder, and Grasset may not be his fault; he relied on Moutier's 1908 dissertation 
as his secondary source material. Moutier was the student of Pierre Marie, who was 
notorious for his antipathy toward anyone who fractionated language into its com- 
ponent elements and thus anyone who believed that there were several different types 
of aphasia, obviously the main tenet of the diagram-makers. Ironicallymand history 
sometimes has a penchant for the ironic--it was Pierre Marie who proposed that the 
insula (Island of Reil) was a functional component of expressive language (Marie's 
quadrilateral), the evidence for which was finally obtained by electrical stimulation 
studies (Ojemann & Whitaker, 1978b) of the insula that elicited naming errors. On 
the matter of psychological versus neurological modeling, Marie's basic objection to 
those who believed in localization, the diagram-makers, was a psychological onem 
for example, his slogan "l'aphasie est une." In Marie's view, language was recon- 
structed again such that it became comprehension (understanding, the lexicon, etc.); 
what for Broca had been language, speech production, Marie relegated to the status 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
45 
of motoric output. To this day, neurolinguistics has wrestled with the problem of how 
to incorporate the motor component of language into a model of the expressive apha- 
sias. In the 1960s and 1970s, this was one of the major theoretical disputes between 
the Mayo School of Darley, Arons0n, Brown, et al. (apraxia of speech) and the Boston 
School of Geschwind, Goodglass, Benson, et al. (Broca's aphasia with dysarthria). 
Although it seems quite clear that most of the diagram-makers well understood the 
different demands of a psychological versus a neurological model, they did occasion- 
ally make real mistakes. Laubstein (1993) has elegantly shown that Lichtheim, the 
"paradigmatic diagram-maker" and one of those discussed in Morton's chapter, had 
produced a neurolinguistic model that is ambiguous with respect to some predictions 
of language disorders, that fails to predict some language disorders that had already 
been described, that is internally inconsistent, and, finally, that cannot be falsified, all 
in terms of the 19th-century paradigm within which Lichtheim operated. Laubstein's 
(1993) analysis of Lichtheim's model goes to the heart of the basic model-making 
assumption of that period and of our own: the correlation between aphasic language 
data and the components of the processing model of language used to account for 
such data. What Morton says is the diagram-makers' "mistake" was certainly not 
characteristic of all of them. There is little to be gained in pointing out how our 
forebears differed from us; one hopes there is much to be learned in analyzing how 
they developed and tested hypotheses. 
To Broca, language was still thought of as expressive (speech) output, since the 
time of Galen in point of fact. Things were to change quickly. Beginning at least as 
early as 1866 with the publication by Theodor Meynert of a case of receptive aphasia 
with jargon, followed by the dissertation of Arnoldus van Rhijn on aphasia in 1868 
in which the notion of "disconnection" was introduced, in turn followed by Henry 
Charlton Bastian's symmetric model of language input and output in 1869, the stage 
was set for the reconstruction of language to include comprehension, seen in the work 
of John Hughlings Jackson and Carl Wernicke starting in 1874. 
1-8. INTRODUCING 
THE 
CONCEPT 
OF RECEPTIVE 
APHASIA: 
THEODOR 
MEYNERT 
From the historical perspective, the neurolinguistic studies of the 1860s to the 1890s 
(the classical aphasia period) take on a foreshadowed, albeit interesting place in the 
story. But there is a twist, as in all good stories. Through the first two-thirds of the 
19th century, language was constructed as the power of verbal expression or produc- 
tion and was associated with, or identified as, memory. It should be emphasized that 
neither Gall nor Broca overlooked or ignored, or failed to grasp, the concept of verbal 
comprehension: in their epoch, "comprehension"--or, to use more common 19th- 
century terminology, "understanding"mwas not part of language; it was part of the 
mind, or, as we would now say, cognition. One of the significant contributions of Carl 
Wernicke in his 1874 paper "The Symptom Complex of Aphasia" (see Eggert, 1977), 
was the reconstruction of language so that comprehension became a separable 

46 
Harry A. Whitaker 
component of language and thus a candidate for cerebral localization. Wernicke is 
traditionally considered the first to describe the features of, and the brain pathology 
underlying, impaired auditory comprehension and related linguistic dysfunctions. This 
tradition persists in spite of the fact that in his 1874 paper Wernicke clearly, properly, 
and repeatedly acknowledged his indebtedness to his mentor, Theodor Meynert. Today, 
when anyone mentions Meynert and Wernicke, this debt is understood to mean merely 
that Meynert taught Wernicke neuroanatomy. Wernicke's own words support this in- 
terpretation: he said that his 1874 work essentially reflected his application to the 
study of aphasia, of Meynert's neuroanatomical approach. As usual, the real story is 
not that simple (Whitaker & Etlinger, 1993). 
Francois Boller (1977) already noted that the concept of receptive aphasia had been 
discussed in an 1871 publication by Johann Baptist Schmidt. Two years before that, 
in 1869, Henry Charlton Bastian had proposed that a disturbance in the comprehension 
of language ought to parallel the disturbance in expression that had been proposed by 
Broca. Neither Schmidt nor Bastian supported their analyses with autopsy evidence, 
nor had they suggested what the underlying anatomy of language comprehension 
might be; thus, neither Schmidt's nor Bastian's work could be said to dislodge Wer- 
nicke's claim of priority to the anatomical model of comprehension. However, a vir- 
tually unknown work by Theodor von Meynert, "An Anatomical Analysis of a Case 
of Speech Disturbance," appeared in 1866 in the 22nd Annual Medical Yearbook of 
the Journal of the Imperial and Royal Society of Physicians in Vienna (pp. 152-187) 
(see Whitaker & Etlinger, 1993). In this paper, Meynert discussed the case of a 23- 
year-old servant girl suffering from left coronary valves stenosis. About 2 weeks 
before her death, she experienced "a sudden inhibition of expressive speech" (Mey- 
nert's words, translated from the German). Although she was free of any paretic 
symptoms and possessed complete mobility of the tongue, she was unable to access 
the individual words necessary for communication (e.g., head, or hand), while the 
missing words' substitutes that emerged from her had no relationship with the intended 
communication. For example, she produced the word yellow in place of the word 
hand (to continue with Meynert's description of the aphasia). At the same time, in 
many cases when she achieved a congruency between the word and its prevailing 
image, her word construction was defective. For example, prior to the appearance of 
her partial speech disturbance, she had always articulated the word Husten (= cough) 
correctly, but ever since she transformed the word into Hutzen (has no meaning in 
German). 
It is clear that Meynert described two types of paraphasias that we typically as- 
sociate with so-called Wernicke's aphasia, the unrelated semantic type and the pho- 
nological type. The autopsy showed that an embolus had blocked an artery in the 
Island of Reil (insula) leading to pathological changes in the most posterior gyrus of 
the insula and in the posterior portions of temporal lobe above the insula, part of what 
we now refer to as the planum temporale and part of what we refer to as Wernicke's 
area. Although it is clear that Meynert was describing sensory aphasia, it is also clear 
that his main interest in this paper was on anatomy and histology. He used this case, 
plus five others that had been sent him by colleagues, to argue that since the acoustic 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
47 
nerve terminates in the temporal lobe wall of the Sylvian fossa, this cortex is a "res- 
onance field" or "sound field" and thus is a "central organ for speech." In his sum- 
mary remarks, he noted that, over a lifetime, memories enter the cortex via facial 
(visual) and tactile perceptions and these combine with sound patterns to result in 
such linguistic functions as naming. In the case of this patient, Meynert says: "al- 
though her visual memory was intact, she was not able to pull the sound pattern, 
formerly joined to the visual, over the threshold of consciousness." He argues that 
the clinical and anatomical facts at present do not permit him to decide between two 
choices: (a) that the sound images were destroyed or (b) that they were merely dis- 
connected from their corresponding visual imagesma controversy that was to occupy 
classical neuropsychology for many years to come, even though no one has ever 
referenced Meynert's paper where one finds the original interpretative dilemma. Ac- 
cording to his biographer, Max De Crinis, Theodor von Meynert was resigned to the 
fact that he would not receive much recognition for his ideas during his lifetime; 
however, he was convinced that his ideas would be vindicated later. To some extent, 
this has already happened: today we speak of association and projection fiber systems; 
many current models rely extensively on proposed white-matter tract connections; the 
analysis of cell assemblies and comparative neuroanatomy are important approaches 
in neuroscience; the relationship of blood flow to brain functions is a cornerstone of 
PET studies; we still make a distinction between reflex and voluntary motor control; 
and we still think of the frontal lobes as an important substrate of socially correct 
behavior. It may come as something of a surprise to realize that every one of these 
ideas was pioneered by Theodor yon Meynert. We should add one more to the list, 
the suggestion that the posterior first temporal gyrus plays a special role in auditory 
language processing (Whitaker & Etlinger, 1993). 
1-9. LOCALIZING 
AND DIAGRAMMING: 
HENRY 
CHARLTON 
BASTIAN 
In a biographical sketch, Marshall (1994, p. 101) noted that during his career H. C. 
Bastian believed in abiogenesis, the spontaneous formation of life from nonliving 
substances, and in heterogenesis, the appearance of one life-form as the offspring of 
another, different life-form. One suspects that these beliefs caused Bastian's colleagues 
then and later to ignore his contributions to aphasia; except for Marshall's insightful 
critical Introduction to his ideas (1994, pp. 103-111) and Head's (1926) condemnation 
of him along with the other "diagram-makers," Bastian is hardly discussed at all in 
the history of neurolinguistics. This is unfortunate since his contributions can easily 
be considered among the best of the epoch of the localizers and diagrammers. A 
sample of the ideas in his work notes that Bastian provided one of the first detailed 
and persuasive analyses of what was then called "word blindness" and "word deaf- 
ness" (Marshall, 1994, p. 103). Bastian argued that writing is a more conscious ac- 
tivity than speaking because the muscles of the arm are more voluntary than the 
orofacial muscles. He distinguished storage from retrieval in verbal memory and 

48 
Harry A. Whitaker 
proposed three types of verbal memory: auditory, visual and kinesthetic. Bastian un- 
derstood that "center" was as much a psychological as an anatomical concept and 
recognized that some language functions did not necessarily have a focal locus and 
that some language functions were distributed in networks. He was one of the first to 
call attention to the role of the angular gyrus (pli courbe) in visual, memory as well 
as in word recall (note that he did not reference Meynert's earlier work on this subject). 
In his model, the centers are separable from the places that exert direct "live" control. 
In his 1869 paper, Bastian laid out his model of speaking, reading, writing, and 
their cerebral processes; he began with a discussion of acquisition of language from 
an associationist-sensationalist perspective but, allowed for hereditary transmission of 
specialized brain structures for speech (from ancient, historical times). According to 
his psychological model of language acquisition, reading and writing are added to 
speaking, again by associationist principles. At this point Bastian brings anatomic 
centers into the description. Early on he realized that one studies aphasia by looking 
at the effects of lesions in a center, in a connecting pathway, or in the center's con- 
nection to the periphery. 
Bastian's model was a dynamic, network model; for example, speaking is explained 
as follows: (1) excitation in the visual word center (2) arouses, through the visual- 
auditory commissure, (3) the auditory word center, which in turn incites (4) the glosso- 
kinesthetic center via a pathway (later, this path was to be called the arcuate fasci- 
culus). His model is a functional, task-oriented one, much more dynamic or interactive 
than is usually thought of the classical localizers and diagrammers. According to 
Bastian, words build associations to percepts and concepts, and so on, so that in 
thought processes the cerebral activity is not limited to narrowly localized centers, but 
there are widespread processes of activity in varied regions of cortex, in both hemi- 
spheres. The data suggested to Bastian that his "centers" actually have subparts, thus 
paving the way for a more fine-grained linguistic analysis which was to come years 
later. 
Bastian proposed that concepts emerge out of perceptive processes and that this 
would take place in parts of brain in close relation, structurally and functionally, to 
the several sensory centers; Bastian called these "Annexes" (a "surround" of brain), 
and he says that they are the same as the association areas of Flechsig! According to 
Bastian, these areas (after Flechsig) are parts of prefrontal lobe, a large part of tem- 
poral lobe, a large part of posterior parietal lobe, and the island of Reil. These areas 
seem to have no direct afferent and efferent connections (shades of the Geschwind 
model), which of course led to the dispute between Bastian, on the one hand, and 
Broadbent, Lichtheim, Kussmaul, and so on, on the other over a piece of the diagram 
(the concept, naming, or ideation center), according to: 
1. psychological arguments about theory of language 
2. clincal data about explanation for types of aphasia 
However, Bastian recognized the need to add something for higher-order functions 
(intellect, concepts, ideas) thus, he accepted the Broadbent/Flechsig proposal of the 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics 
49 
association areas as a conceptual (psychological) addition to his model, at the same 
time suggesting the concept of "annexes" around his centers instead of another center. 
One implication is that an impairment of idea/intellect would necessarily be accom- 
panied by an impairment in the proximate sensory center, which of course is an 
empirical issue! Bastian (1898, pp. 80-113) discussed case histories to show that 
Broca's aphasia can exist without agraphia. Although, by 1898-1897, Wernicke and 
Dejerine had evidently rejected the idea of a writing center, for the reason that writing 
is just the simple copying of visual images stored in visual word centers, Bastian used 
the case history approach to attack this idea and support the idea of a writing center. 
But perhaps the most important feature of Bastian's diagrams, one shared by many 
other diagram-makers, is that he tried to create a dynamic model in which the functions 
of centers depended on specific kinds of input from other components. And the most 
important feature of his neurolinguistic research was his recognition that empirical 
data informed his models; data could support or reject any aspect of his model of 
language functions. 
1-10. EARLY AGRAMMATISM RESEARCH: 
JACKSON, PICK, HEAD, AND WEISENBURG 
AND McBRIDE 
Impairments of grammatical structures are essentially linguistic aspects of aphasia, 
relevant to the structure of language at the complex word, phrase, sentence, and dis- 
course levels (Whitaker, 1997). Although most historical discussions of neurolinguis- 
tics mention the principal figures in the history of agrammatism, it is more problematic 
to situate them in the context of classical aphasia studies. The model of sentence 
structure proposed by John Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911) and employed by Arnold 
Pick (1851-1924) in particular and Henry Head (1861-1940) to a lesser extent, rep- 
resents a different line of historical development than the classical models of their 
contemporaries. One difference is that premodern work on agrammatism (Pick) and 
syntactical aphasia (Head) employed abstract, mental models of sentence structure that 
were presumed to underlie observed speech, models that seem to be formally equiv- 
alent to contemporary cognitive neuropsychological models of language, albeit vastly 
less detailed, whereas the aphasia studies of contemporaries such as Broca, Wernicke, 
Lichtheim, Dejerine, Marie, Bastian, and others were typically limited to taxonomic 
analyses of observable word- and subword-level phenomena, which were correlated 
with specific, observable brain sites. 
John Hughlings Jackson was interested in how two aspects of speech, voluntary 
and involuntary expressions, might be localized in the two sides of the brain; in his 
study of involuntary or automatic speech, he spent much of his time analyzing the 
recurrent utterances of patients with expressive aphasia. Jackson did not seem to have 
taken much interest in the different varieties of aphasia with which his contemporaries 
were engrossed; in his collected papers on affections of speech (Taylor, 1958), aside 

50 
Harry A. Whitaker 
from Broca, there are no discussions of Wernicke, Dejerine, Lichtheim, and others 
who contributed to the classical model of aphasia. Yet it was Jackson's notion of the 
proposition as the essential unit of internal mental structure as well as expressive 
language that, in the work of Arnold Pick and Henry Head, laid the foundations for 
the study of agrammatism. In his "Notes on the Physiology and Pathology of the 
Nervous System" (1868), Jackson first develops the propositional basis of language, 
as well as his ideas concerning the role of the right hemisphere in automatic (invol- 
untary) expression and perception. That this is a psycholinguistic construct is clear: 
"the meaning of a proposition does not depend on the mere words which compose 
it, but on the relations these words have to one another--such a relation that the 
sentence is a unit" (Taylor, 1958, pp. 234-235). 
Arnold Pick wrote the first treatise devoted exclusively to agrammatism, only sec- 
tions of which have been translated from the German (Spreen, 1973; Friederici, 1994). 
Although linguistic theory was not well developed in 1913 when Pick completed this 
monograph, some of his theoretical assumptions are notable. He assumed that a sen- 
tence schema, which logically implied a syntactic structure, precedes the selection of 
lexical items; he suggested that content words were selected prior to function words, 
after which surface grammatical form is specified (Friederici, 1994, p. 257; see also 
Spreen, 1973, pp. 147-152, for a more detailed analysis of the hierarchical order in 
Pick's microgenesis of language). From Pick's monograph on agrammatism: 
that the schematic formulation of the sentence precedes the choice of words, as well as the 
syntactic formulation and the portion of the grammatical functions that corresponds to it, is 
shown by the fact that the meaning of a single word, whatever it may be, is determined only 
by the position it takes or interacts with; therefore the mental framework should in principle 
be ready in a grammatical sense as well: before the choice of words ensues, the plan has to 
be determined before the different pieces are put together. (Friederici, 1994, p. 267) 
Pick considered the question of agrammatism again in a chapter published posthu- 
mously in 1931 (Brown, 1973, pp. 76-86). This represented his final ideas on this 
subject; we note, of course, that he would have read Henry Head's ideas on the subject 
by this time. Pick discussed two forms of expressive agrammatism, motor (quantita- 
tive) and sensory (qualitative). He attributed both to the loss of and/or impaired control 
over grammatical devices (Friederici, 1994, pp. 258-259). He associated "motor 
agrammatism" with motor aphasia, frontal lesions, and a telegraphic style, whereas 
he linked "sensory agrammatism" with Kleist's "paragrammatism" (thus, with lesions 
of the temporal lobe), although emphasizing speech output, or what he called "the 
expressive side" (Brown, 1973, p. 76). From the 1931 chapter: 
This temporally determined form is characterized, in pure cases, by disturbances in the use 
of auxiliary words, incorrect word inflections, and erroneous prefixes and suffixes. In other 
words, it concerns all those linguistic devices which serve to express relationships between 
objects, which differ widely and numerically from one language to another.... Regarding 
telegraphic style of primary origin, discussed in relation to motor agrammatism, in which 
the word order is not appreciably disturbed, alterations of word order have occasionally been 
reported as due to a discrepancy between the normal order (most important element first) 
and the grammatically required order (final position of the verb as in the languages of 

1 
History of Neurolinguistics

children). However, a thorough investigation of this question, based upon linguistics.., is 
not yet available .... 
absence of or defect in the auxiliary words which are normally 
produced in automatic fashion. It is probable that the patient with motor agrammatism at 
times retains the sentence skeleton since he may not comprehend the prepositions nor be 
able to write them .... 
The patient attempts to produce the best possible results (that which 
best makes him understood) with the least expenditure of effort, utilizing the optimal but 
still automatic application of his linguistic resources .... 
Another likely factor is the at- 
tention fixed on the effortful production of speech. If the prepositions are either not automatic 
or only incompletely so, attention will not suffice for their voluntary production .... 
In 
paragrammatism, the temporal form of expressive agrammatism, it must be remembered that 
grammar is by no means a unified process, but contains many factors which may be affected 
separately or in combination. In this form, the disorder lies one stage deeper than telegram- 
matism .... 
There is a discrepancy between poor agrammatical speech and better appraisal 
of ungrammatical sentences presented to the patient. This is explained by the contrast be- 
tween defective or absent feeling for the language [and] the fact that the patient recognizes 
what he sees as incorrect, but is incapable of putting it into correct grammatical form. 
(Brown, 1973, pp. 74-84) 
In the following chapter on word and speech deafness, Pick continues his discussion 
of agrammatic phenomena: 
Disorders of the second type concern what is called sensory (impressive) agrammatism (in 
the narrow sense). Disturbance of stages in the comprehension of sentence meaning which 
correspond to the grammaticization of the sentence, insofar as both characterize relationships, 
will disturb to a varying extent the comprehension of those relationships. There may also 
be a loss of knowledge of sentence form .... 
this latter form is generally not separated 
from the others, both for clinical considerations (e.g., the coexistence of expressive and 
sensory agrammatism) as well as psychological considerations (e.g., the same process is at 
one time centrifugal and at another centripetal) .... 
A distinction should be made between 
lack of comprehension of the grammatical forms of correct speech and inadequate recog- 
nition of incorrect forms. (Brown, 1973, pp. 94-95) 
Pick (1931 [in Brown, 1973]) placed syntactic organization in a central position 
between sound and meaning, giving it a primary role in expression and in compre- 
hension. He recognized that there are multiple components to syntactic structure, not 
all of which are affected at the same time in the varieties of expressive and receptive 
grammatical impairment. Borrowing from Jackson, he distinguished automatic from 
voluntary dimensions of syntax, partly to explain the observed differences between 
agrammatic production and comprehension. 
One often remembers Henry Head for his lively, though inaccurate and misdirected, 
attack on the "diagram-makers," his term for the classical aphasiologists. Head is 
rarely noted for his criticisms of superficial descriptions of aphasia such as "motor" 
or "sensory," nor for his effort to avoid uninformative clinical descriptions such as 
"the patient was said to be able to read and write, although he could not speak" 
(1926, 1: pp. 197-217). Caplan's (1987) discussion of Head's critique of inclusive 
diagnostic categories of aphasia points out that Head had observed that actual aphasic 
performance usually crosses descriptive boundaries, that specific aphasic symptoms 
are often transient, and that there is wide variation in aphasic performance in patients 
with quite similar lesions (1987, pp. 83-88). As Caplan thoughtfully observed, these 
problems remain largely unsolved.

Harry A. Whitaker 
Contemporary researchers correlate Head's syntactical aphasia with the syndrome 
of Wernicke's aphasia (cf. Lecours, Lhermitte, & Bryans, 1983, pp. 254-255; Good- 
glass & Kaplan, 1983, p. 77; Goodglass, 1993, p. 24; Benson & Ardila, 1996, pp. 
114-115). This may not do justice to Head's theoretical analysis of aphasia. As Wei- 
senburg and McBride (1935) observed, "The syntactical form in Head's conception 
differs from the sensory aphasia which shows pronounced disturbances of speaking 
and also from the so-called agrammatism or paragrammatism, but partakes of the 
nature of these" (1935, 50); Weisenburg and McBride credit Delacroix with the ob- 
servation of the correspondence between Head's four aphasia categories and the hy- 
pothesized stages of thought to spoken expression. This is similar to Pick's (1913) 
conception, which, according to Spreen (1973), was drawn from the contemporary 
psychological research of Wilhelm Wundt, Karl Buhler, William James, and others. 
Following this model, Head characterizes syntactical aphasia as a defect in an internal 
grammatical arrangement (1935, pp. 50-51). Weisenburg and McBride wrote of Head's 
system as though it were only a classification of the aphasias; it is likely, however, 
that Head was trying to develop a psycholinguistic theory with which to describe 
aphasic disorders. For Head there are four dimensions to symbolic formulation and 
expression, each or any of which may break down; thus, instead of four aphasic types, 
there are four aspects to aphasia that would manifest themselves in varying degrees 
in any one patient. Head was attempting to characterize the nature of language im- 
pairments in their psychological context, albeit without benefit of well-constructed 
linguistic or psycholinguistic theories. Thus, the four categories were exemplars, not 
categorical types: "No two examples of aphasia exactly resemble one another; each 
represents the response of a particular individual to the abnormal conditions. But, in 
many cases, the morbid manifestations can be roughly classed under such descriptive 
categories as Verbal, Syntactical, Nominal or Semantic defects of symbolic formula- 
tion and expression" (Head, 1926, 2: p.x). 
In Head's theory, syntactical defects (1: pp. 230-240) represent impaired gram- 
matical phrase structure as well as impaired rhythmic components of symbolic for- 
mulation, what we would now label "prosodic." As an example he observed that "the 
patient talks rapidly, his speech is jargon, and prepositions, conjunctions and articles 
tend to be omitted" (2: p. xiv). He probably used the term "syntactical" instead of 
"agrammatic" because he believed that the language impairments are deeper than 
surface, observable grammatical words; he thought that these deficits affected the basic 
(and, of course, internal and mental) formation and use of language (1: p. 240). His 
patients' agrammatic production, both verbal and written, is well described, although 
Head fails to theoretically link the expressive impairments with the patients' evident 
comprehension difficulties, a theoretical lapse that Pick did not make. Consider, for 
example, Head's case of syntactical aphasia number 15: 
Asked what he had done since he came to the London Hospital, he replied, "To here; only 
washing, cups and plates." Have you played any games? "Played games, yes, played one, 
daytime, garden." . . . He did not usually employ wrong words and, if the subject under 
discussion was known, it was not difficult to gather the sense of what he wished to say. 
Thus, when I was testing his taste and placed some quinine upon his tongue, he said, "Rotten 

1

53 
to drink it. Something medicine or that. Make you drop of water after it, so to take out of 
your mouth." . . . when asked to say after me short sentences, which he had not heard 
before, his defective syntax became evident .... 
In this case the disorder of language 
mainly affected syntax and rhythm. The production of single words and their use as names 
were not materially disturbed; but groups of words could not be combined into coherent and 
effective phrases. (1: pp. 174-178.) 
When Weisenburg and McBride (1935) completed their clinical psychological study 
of aphasia, both agrammatism and of paragrammatism had been incorporated into 
general descriptions of language disorders due in part to the efforts of German re- 
searchers such as Bonhoeffer, Goldstein, Salamon, Isserlin, Kleist (who had coined 
the term "paragrammatism") and Pick. In their analysis of agrammatism, Weisenburg 
and McBride (1935, pp. 60-61, 71-72) noted the omission of grammatical words (tele- 
graphic style), disrupted word order, and the omission or substitution of prefixes, 
suffixes, and inflections. They also discussed the "economy of effort" principle as a 
cause of agrammatic aphasia and, in addition, several of the tests in their aphasia 
battery explicitly addressed the evaluation of grammatical abilities. It seems evident 
that Weisenburg and McBride understood the central nature of agrammatical distur- 
bances, as the following comments demonstrate: 
The question of paragrammatism has already been touched on in connection with agram- 
matism and the cortical form of motor aphasia. It has been said that paragrammatism is 
characterized by confusions of grammatical forms, of auxiliaries, pronouns, prepositions, 
and so forth, and by changes in word order. A consideration of the nature and extent of 
these errors makes it evident that they are not simply the result of word-substitutions, and 
consequently not like the paraphasic errors. They involve a more extensive change which 
shows uncertainty, not so much in the choice of words, as in the grammatical and formal 
aspects of the sentence structure. (1935, p. 72.) 
Historically, an interesting aspect of Weisenburg and McBride's research is their rec- 
ognition that Henry Head had attempted a psycholinguistic analysis of the aphasias, 
that Arnold Pick had proposed an abstract structural model of agrammatism, and that 
both Head and Pick had based their ideas on those of Jackson. Perhaps one should 
regard their commentary as a nascent cognitive tradition in neurolinguistics. 
1-11. SOURCES FOR THE HISTORY 
OF NEUROLINGUISTICS 
Although the history of psychology, and, of course, the history of medicine, are well 
represented in both primary and secondary source material, the history of neuropsy- 
chology, and in particular the history of neurolinguistics, are not as yet. In their 
seminal paper, Benton and Joynt (1960) collected descriptions of language disorders 
in historical documents from the last 50 centuries. Starting from the famous Case 22 
of the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus (c. 3000 B.C.), they traced examples of aphasic 
disorders in the ancient Greek (Hippocratic corpus), Latin (Valerius Maximus, Pliny 
the Elder), medieval, and Renaissance medical traditions (e.g., Guainerius, 1481), 

54 
Harry A. Whitaker 
observations from the 17th century (Schmidt, 1673; Rommel, 1682), and the illumin- 
istic literature (Linnaeus, 1745; Morgagni, 1762; Gesner, 1770). 
O'Neill's (1980) scholarly text argues that, at least through the Renaissance, ob- 
servations of aphasic symptomatology were hardly part and parcel of any general, 
coherent theoretical model of brain-language relationships. Her summary of early 
neurolinguistics ends at the 17th century, leaving us with a number of gaps in the 
story from the Renaissance to the 20th century, gaps that are only partly filled in by 
current research on persons who have actually made substantial contributions to the 
development of neuropsychology and neurolinguistics. 
In the readers by Clarke and O'Malley (1968), by Hunter and Macalpine (1982), 
and by Shipley (1961), one finds selected excerpts from works by Gall, Broca, and 
Jackson as well as Jean Baptiste Bouillaud (1796-1881), Simon Alexandre Ernest 
Aubertin (1825-1865), Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832), and George Combe 
(1788-1858), all relevant the the history of neurolinguistics. None of the three are as 
complete as Eling's (1994) Reader in the History of Aphasia, but the overlap is not 
at all extensive. 
Two exemplary models of historical analysis of the trends in the neurosciences as 
well as insightful expositions of the varying milieu are to be found in Harrington 
(1987) and Clarke and Jacyna (1987). Caplan (1987) contains two thought-provoking 
chapters of historical analysis that focus on theoretical models of classical authors 
from a contemporary point of view. Bouton's monograph, Neurolinguistics: Historical 
and Theoretical Perspectives (1991), begins with ancient Egyptian (Pharaonic) texts 
and carries the discussion to modern neurolinguistic studies in the 1980s. The 1993 
issue of Brain and Language (vol. 45, no. 4) is exclusively on historical studies in 
neurolinguistics; the guest editors for this issue were Gonia Jarema and Roch Lecours. 
A monumental compendium of significant archival value is Finger's text (1994); it 
treats the origins of neuroscience from the earliest written records to the latter half of 
the 20th century. Nearly a third of the chapters bear directly on neurolinguistic issues. 
Eling's (1994) Reader in the History of Aphasia, excerpts the work of Franz Joseph 
Gall (1758-1828), Pierre Paul Broca (1824-1880), Carl Wernicke (1848-1905), Henry 
Charlton Bastian (1837-1915), John Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Sigmund Freud 
(1856-1939), Jules Dejerine (1849-1917), Pierre Marie (1853-1940), Arnold Pick 
(1851-1924), Henry Head (1861-1940), Kurt Goldstein (1878-1965), and Norman 
Geschwind (1926-1984). By and large this is a good selection of historical work on 
brain and language.

CHAPTER 2 
Methodological and Statistical 
Considerations in Cognitive 
Neurolinguistics 
Klaus Willmes 
Neurologische Klinik--Neuropsychologie, Universit~itsklinikum RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany 
Three broadly characterized phases of (cognitive) neurolinguistic research on the 
relation of language and the brain are discerned. The modern cognitive neuro- 
linguistic and cognitive neuropsychological research program in general, which 
dominate the third phase, are outlined with a view on diverging and opposing 
lines of argumentation. Challenges from the neurosciences and connectionist 
modeling are mentioned as well. Afterwards, two methodological approaches rel- 
evant for conducting technically adequate single-case studies are described in 
some detail. The concepts of criterion-referenced measurement are shown to be 
useful for assessing a patient's degree of competence in some task domain. Fur- 
thermore, it is argued that randomization tests allow for valid statistical tests in 
individual subjects. Both approaches are combined to provide operational defi- 
nitions of three types of (double) dissociations as proposed by Shallice (1988). 
The last two decades have witnessed a proliferation of theoretical developments and 
empirical findings in the fields of neurolinguistics and neuropsychology in general 
(see, for example, Coltheart, Sartori, & Job, 1987; Denes, Semenza, & Bisiacchi, 1988; 
Mapou & Spector, 1995; Margolin, 1992; McCarthy & Warrington, 1990a). These 
have helped to improve an understanding of the complex brain-behavior relationships

(or brain-cognitive mechanisms) involved in processing language or performing other 
higher cognitive functions. 
Yet there are ongoing debates, not only about the adequacy of particular models 
of language processing or the interpretation of particular experimental results--a ubiq- 
uitous state of affairs in all (empirical) sciences--but rather about more general meth- 
odological, metatheoretical, and epistemological concerns. Central to these debates are 
two issues. First, this chapter discusses the way patterns of impaired (and spared) 
language performances in individual patients subsequent to some form of (acquired) 
brain damage can be employed to reveal the "nature" of language processing per se. 
Second, many researchers express more or less strong reservations about whether this 
is possible without recourse to what is known about the structure and functioning of 
the human central nervous system itself. After characterizing three overlapping phases 
in neurolinguistics in terms of dominating methodological, statistical, and psycho- 
metric approaches, the chapter will focus on an exposition and discussion of the logic 
of inference and of methodological problems encountered in cognitive neurolinguis- 
tics, followed by a discussion of (more specific) psychometric and inferential statistical 
issues related to the cognitive neurolinguistic and neuropsychological approach. 
2-1. RESEARCH PHASES IN NEUROLINGUISTICS 
2-1.1. The Classical Clinical Approach 
Clinical observations and clinical studies are as old as aphasiology itself. Case reports 
from the second half of the nineteenth century already were often detailed, but they 
lacked methodological and psychometric rigor. These reports concentrated on the (clin- 
ical) examination of the specific pattern of impairments of the patient under study 
rather than on properties of the examination process itself, the reason being obvious: 
there was no elaborate empirical and psychometric methodology at hand. Nevertheless, 
the Wernicke-Lichtheim model of word processing (Lichtheim, 1885) was an impor- 
tant early accomplishment in theorizing about (impaired) language processing in 
relation to brain organization and its impairment subsequent to brain lesions. Never- 
theless, the "diagram-makers'" approach was subjected to three major criticisms 
concerning their postulates of precise localization, their inadequate psychological con- 
cepts, and their weak empirical accounts (Shallice, 1988, Chapter 1-2). 
2-1.2. The Modern Group-Study Approach 
In accord with developments of methodology in psychology and advances in theoret- 
ical linguistics, psycho- and neurolinguistic experimental studies were carried out with 
more or less narrowly defined (aphasic) patient groups. These were formed according 
to type, side, and site of brain lesion and/or more or less broadly defined patterns of 
language symptomatology (aphasic syndromes). The aim of the studies was to examine 
specific aspects of differences in level and/or quality of expressive or receptive lan- 

2 
Methodological and Statistical Considerations 
59 
guage impairments under different experimental conditions focusing on specific lan- 
guage modalities, components of language, and stages of language processing. De- 
velopments in psychological diagnostics, including the concern for psychometrically 
controlled assessment procedures, were also taken up in aphasiological studies in that 
the selection of patients was primarily based on the pattern of performances in com- 
prehensive diagnostic test batteries with well-studied objectivity, reliability, and valid- 
ity properties (for an overview, see Willmes, 1993 and the references cited there), in 
what Shallice (1988) termed the "modern aphasia group-study approach." Besides 
the growing body of psycho- and neurolinguistic assessment procedures, psychological 
on-line reaction time measurement methodology was introduced. This approach em- 
ploys the additive factors rationale of Sternberg (1969) to support the existence of 
sequentially organized stages in language processing. Psychophysical (skin conduc- 
tance, sonographic blood flow registration), and electrophysiological measurement 
methods (evoked or event-related brain potentials) are utilized to study brain-behavior 
relationships when performing language processing tasks. Functional neuroimaging 
techniques (SPECT, PET, and fMRI) employed in language activation studies are con- 
sidered to contribute new knowledge about brain-language relationships (Habib & 
Demonet, 1996). 
2-1.3. The Cognitive, Information-Processing Approach 
The advent of cognitive psychology in the late 1960s and 1970s brought with it a 
major change at the theoretical level in trying to get away from the ruling empiricism 
of experimental psychology. Information-processing models were developed in general 
psychology and psycholinguistics for various cognitive functions, such as the logogen 
model of John Morton (1980) for single-word processing in normal subjects. Typi- 
cally, in this type of model some complex cognitive or language behavior is decom- 
posed into a hypothetical sequence of processing steps, in which information in some 
representational format flows from one processing component to the next, with specific 
transformations within the components operating on these representations (Massaro & 
Cowan, 1993). Although early models were often mute with respect to particular types 
of representations and processes, this way of theorizing opens up a sensible way to 
characterize patterns of impaired cognitive performance in general and impaired lan- 
guage processing in particular in terms of damaged (sub)components and/or trans- 
mission routes. In early accounts of this approach (for example, Marin, Saffran, & 
Schwartz, 1976), the expectations concerning the relevance of neuropsychological ev- 
idence for the understanding of normal function were rather modest, and hoped to 
yield a taxonomy of functional or isolable (sub)systems (Posner, 1978; Tulving, 1983) 
within a broadly modular overall system architecture (Marr, 1982; Fodor, 1983). Marin 
et al., however, pointed out that the constraints due to the functional and anatomical 
architecture of the brain have to be taken into consideration. Later on, researchers 
have become more confident that cognitive neuropsychology can do more than just 
explain the pattern of impaired and intact cognitive performance seen in brain- 
damaged patients in terms of damage to one or more of the components of a model 

60 
Klaus Willmes 
of cognitive functioning (Ellis & Young, 1988; Olson & Caramazza, 1991). The 
approach is deemed powerful enough to allow drawing conclusions about normal, 
intact cognitive processes; that is, it is assumed that the understanding of normal 
function can be enhanced by studying impaired function (see Shallice, 1988). 
On the methodological side, the study of single cases has regained respect again 
(Shallice, 1979; Valsiner, 1986 for general psychology). Group studies, in which pa- 
tients were allocated according to brain lesion or "weak" clinical syndromes (Schwartz, 
1984; Marshall & Newcombe, 1984; Caramazza & Badecker, 1989), were not con- 
sidered informative because of the apparent functional heterogeneity across patients 
despite frequent co-occurrences of sets of symptoms. It was also argued that the clas- 
sical aphasia syndromes might even be artifacts of the vascularization of the brain 
(Poeck, 1983). A similar fate has also happened more recently to more narrowly defined 
functional syndromes such as surface dylexia (Patterson, Marshall, & Coltheart, 1985), 
deep dyslexia (Coltheart, Patterson, & Marshall, 1987), or agrammatism (Berndt, 1987). 
Single-case studies are increasingly considered to provide the most stringent evidence 
for inferences to normal (language) functioning, often with a special status attributed 
to (functional) dissociations (Teuber, 1955; Dunn & Kirsner, 1988) in performance 
and double dissociations, in particular. Shallice (1988) even provides a characterization 
of (strong) functional syndromes via sets of dissociations as the organizing principle 
of his book. The most radical ("ultracognitive") position, as held by Caramazza (1986) 
and McCloskey (1993), is that single-patient studies provide the only valid basis for 
inferring normal cognitive mechanisms from patterns of impaired performances, be 
they dissociations or associations, a claim that will be discussed in the next section. 
2-2. THE 
COGNITIVE 
NEUROLINGUISTICS 
RESEARCH 
PROGRAM 
2-2.1. Basic Assumptions 
The heading seems to imply that researchers in the field would fully agree on what 
constitutes the cognitive neurolinguistics (and cognitive neuropsychology) approach. 
Yet, there is an ongoing debate about the appropriate methodology and logic of in- 
ference that has to be followed when taking data from brain-damaged patients both 
to develop or to test and evaluate cognitive models. There is no need to reiterate the 
various positions in detail, since the exchange of arguments has been well documented. 
After an exposition of the "single-case-only approach" (Caramazza 1984, 1986; Bad- 
ecker & Caramazza, 1985; Caramazza & McCloskey, 1988), a first round of discussion 
followed, filling a whole issue of Cognitive Neuropsychology (Bub & Bub, 1988; 
Caplan, 1988; Newcombe & Marshall, 1988; Whitaker & Slotnick, 1988). A response 
to the critics was written by McCloskey and Caramazza (1988), and additional critical 
contributions were published in other leading journals by Bates, Appelbaum, and 
Allard (1991), Zurif, Gardner, and Brownell (1989), and Zurif, Swinney, and Fodor 
(1991). The most extensive and balanced account, in my view, can be found in Chap- 
ters 9-11 of Tim Shallice's book (1988). 

2 
Methodological and Statistical Considerations 
61 
The next challenge to the position of "strong" cognitive neuropsychology was put 
forward by authors like Kosslyn and Van Kleek (1990), with a response by Caramazza 
(1992), as well as Kosslyn and Intriligator (1992), claiming that behavioral data from 
a single patient cannot provide sufficient evidence for the development of a meaningful 
cognitive science. Rather, computational modelsmwith the possibility of showing what 
sorts of new functions can emerge after damage (Kosslyn & Intriligator, 1992, p. 
102)mand insights from the neurosciences about the realization of cognitive functions 
in "neural hardware" (Kosslyn & Koenig, 1992) would be required. It is important 
to note that Caramazza is not at variance with recognizing that these two sources of 
information are highly relevant in principle. 
Another potentially serious challenge concerns the two fundamental assumptions 
of cognitive neuropsychology. The fractionation assumption states that brain damage 
can result in selective impairment. More so, the transparency assumption claims that 
brain damage can result in local modifications of an otherwise unchanged cognitive 
system, for which universality is assumed, implying that the cognitive systems of 
normal subjects are basically identical. One line of attack dwells on the property of 
the brain to operate in a highly nonlinear fashion with multiple areas being involved 
in processing, often in reciprocal fashion. Farah (1994) therefore goes on to propose 
a new set of assumptions~in line with the parallel distributed processing (PDP) frame- 
work Rumelhart, McClelland, 1986~for drawing inferences about the functional cogni- 
tive architecture. Farah states that human information processing is graded, distributed, 
and interactive. In particular, she discusses a connectionist network model (Farah & Mc- 
Clelland, 1991), which, when lesioned, produces category-specific "naming disorders" 
similar to the double dissociations between the naming of living and nonliving things 
reported in the neuropsychological literature. 
Yet another line of critique has taken up the dismissal of group studies again 
(Robertson, Knight, Rafal, & Shimamura, 1993) in the influential Journal of Experi- 
mental Psychology, followed by a rebuttal from McCloskey (1993) in the same jour- 
nal. The crucial arguments are not really specific to cognitive neuropsychology. They 
concern the possibility or impossibility of guaranteeing homogeneity among brain- 
damaged patients. The whole enterprise of generalizing the (significant) effects found 
in a study of normal subjects rests on the independent a priori assumption that the 
target population is in fact homogeneous with respect to the cognitive mechanisms of 
interest. McCloskey argues (1993) that in patient group studies there is no way of 
knowing beforehand or of demonstrating empirically that homogeneity prevails. Con- 
sequently, the results from a patient sample cannot be generalized to the target patient 
population. But this type of generalization is not needed if one's goal is to relate the 
results obtained in an individual patient to a model of normal processing. Converging 
evidence must be sought from multiple single-patient studies. 
Without going into detail, I want to note that the use of group studies in general 
cognitive psychological research plays a "technical" role also. Typically, theoretical 
claims in cognitive psychology, expressed as psychological hypotheses (PH), are about 
processes and regularities in individual subjects. The hypotheses tested in group stud- 
ies are, however, often hypotheses about populations of subjects, more precisely about 

62 
Klaus Willmes 
the identity or difference of parameters of the population distribution(s) of some 
dependent variable under, say, two experimental conditions. This approach makes 
sense if the population statement can be deduced from the PH. (Random) samples of 
subjects are only employed for the purpose of reducing the influence of nuisance 
variables that may obscure the relation between independent experimental conditions 
and the dependent variable of interest. If one were able to control all the relevant 
nuisance variables adequately when studying just one subject, the results of that single- 
subject experiment would be fully informative with respect to the psychological hy- 
pothesis within the theoretical framework of interest; only, in an inductive framework 
one is attempting to generalize to a population of subjects. This is particularly trou- 
blesome for "open" populations, that is, when lawful statements are assumed to be 
valid also in the future, rendering true random samples impossible. 
2-2.2. Chance Dissociations 
To end this section with a more modest topic, McCloskey (1993) also refutes the 
claim by Robertson et al. (1993) that there is a serious problem in being deceived by 
chance dissociations, when there is no way of replicating results in another patient, 
since every brain damage presents a new experiment of nature. McCloskey points out 
that every measure is taken both through using large numbers of stimuli in a host of 
experimental tasks (possibly with replication) and through appropriate statistical tests 
to determine that the results reported are reliable. These two psychometric and statis- 
tical topics will be covered in the following two sections. 
2-3. PSYCHOMETRIC 
CONSIDERATIONS 
For an in-depth analysis of an individual patient's (language) performance pattern, 
aimed at tapping the source(s) of some language processing deficit within some (ten- 
tative) cognitive model of normal language functioning, assessment procedures are 
very often specifically tailored to the requirements of a particular investigation. Thus 
the methodological approach of cognitive neurolinguistics leads to a theory-motivated 
or theory-driven, yet sometimes ad hoc, collection of items composing the tasks of 
interest. Obviously, no sound empirical evidence concerning the particular reliability 
(homogeneity and stability) and construct validity properties of the items composing 
a specific task, as well as the various tasks themselves, is available. Even if some 
tasks have been employed repeatedly in different single-case studies, the psychometric 
adequacy of the items and tasks remains a matter of observational impression. This 
is not meant to generally question the construct validity (Embretson, 1985) of tasks 
and items. But it is a long way from some language processing modelmbe it of the 
boxes-and-arrows or the network type--to the final decision about how to best tap 
the functions presumably involved in responding to the content of an item, which in 
addition has to be cast in a specific item format for presentation and response. In 
general, the functioning of several subcomponents and/or processing routes is implied 
in any task, let alone the possibility of strategy choices. It is my impression that the 

2 
Methodological and Statistical Considerations 
63 
arduous task of caring for construct validity, which plays a central role in psycholog- 
ical measurement (for example, Messick, 1980; Wainer & Braun, 1988), is given too 
little attention in applications of the cognitive neurolinguistic approach. Empirical 
demonstrations of the psychometric properties of theoretically motivated assessment 
tools such as PALPAL (Kay, Lesser, & Coltheart, 1992; Kay & Franklin, 1995), PAL 
(Caplan, 1995) or LeMo (Stadie, Cholewa, De Bleser, & Tabatabaie, 1994), which 
have been used repeatedly in single-case studies, are still widely lacking. 
2-3.1. Criterion-Referenced Measurement 
In the theoretically--as opposed to psychometricallymoriented cognitive neurolin- 
guistic approach, content validity is implicitly taken to be the major criterion for item 
generation and selection. A test is called content valid (Berk, 1980; Klauer, 1987) if 
it (completely) contains or represents a universe (domain) of items, for example, the 
universe of legal neologisms for a particular language, or the universe of temporal 
prepositions. Such a domain is defined either by exhaustive enumeration of its ele- 
ments or, more often, by stating the properties via some generation rule(s) that an 
item from that particular domain has to fulfill. In both instances, an actual test or task 
usually consists of some representative sample from that domain. For a complete 
characterization of an item, a stimulus and a response component, that is, an operation 
the subject has to perform on the stimulus, are combined to yield a specific item 
format, for example, make a lexical decision or choose a temporal preposition from 
a written multiple-choice set composed of other temporal prepositions in order to 
complete a sentence. 
This general framework is well established in educational psychology and associ- 
ated with criterion-referenced measurement or mastery testing (Hambleton & Novick, 
1973; Hambleton, Swaminathan, Algina, & Coulson, 1978; Suen, 1990; Crocker & 
Algina, 1986). It should prove to be useful in cognitive neurolinguistics as well; in 
fact, it has been employed in some implicit form in the cognitive neurolinguistics- 
oriented language assessment batteries mentioned earlier as well as in theoretically 
motivated single-case experimental studies. Two important aspects are the stratifica- 
tion of a domain according to one or more aspects in a hierarchical or completely 
crossed fashion and the formation of representative samples from each stratum or 
combination of strata in order to draw inferences from the item sample about the 
whole item domain. To give an example, aspects of stratification for reading, writ- 
ing, and lexical decision tasks are word-frequency intervals, numbers of syllables, 
concreteness/abstractness ratings, regular/irregular spelling, complexity of initial, mid- 
dle, final consonant clusters, and so forth. The researcher always has to make an 
informed choice about which of these parameters he wants to vary systematically and 
which he is willing to ignore or control for by allocating items with these properties 
at random to the strata or strata combinations. Subsequently, the proportion of items 
from each stratum or strata combination has to be specified. Representativeness can 
often be obtained by drawing a random sample of prespecified size from the subset. 
This random sampling notion has been debated in earlier psycholinguistic research 

64 
Klaus Willmes 
(Clark, 1973) from another perspective. Random allocation is only meant to 
statistically controlmnot to eliminatemthe influence of such unwanted systematical, 
yet not identified, variation. A similar approach to item generation and selection is 
provided by facet theory, as proposed by Guttman (Shye & Elizur, 1995; for an 
application in aphasiology, see Willmes, Poeck, Weniger, & Huber, 1983). Within that 
approach, a domain is structured according to (content) facets that have the same 
status as strata. These ways of item generation and selection also provide a convenient 
way to obtain (data independent) content valid parallel tests, by drawing distinct 
representative samples from the domain of interest, a prerequisite for proper repeated 
assessment of the same subject when stability of some performance is deemed crucial. 
The notion of content valid parallel tests is implicit when a set of items is randomly 
split, for example, for use under different conditions of presentation. 
For a given domain of study, the degree of competence (achievement, ability) for 
an individual subject i can now be defined as the probability Pi of processing correctly 
items from that particular domain. Empirically, the level of competence must be es- 
timated from a representative sample of items from that domain, the properties of the 
ability estimate being dependent on the particular test model introduced, for example, 
the binomial model. Besides characterizing a subject by means of some competence 
estimate, a (dichotomous) classification according to mastery or nonmastery with re- 
spect to some domain is useful in cognitive neurolinguistics. Mastery can be defined 
to hold, if the individual Pi is no less than some high, lower-bound criterion probability 
Pc often fixed at 0.90 or 0.95. Mastery or criterion-referenced testing thus relates 
individual test performance to a certain (high) level of competence, not to a distri- 
bution of scores across some reference population, as does a diagnostic test constructed 
according to the classical test theory model (Lord & Novick, 1968; Crocker & Algina, 
1986). In cognitive neurolinguistics, the concept of mastery can be utilized to empir- 
ically demonstrate the intactness of some processing components and/or routes in 
particular, when there is (almost) no variation in level of performance in samples of 
control subjects. 
2-3.2. The Binomial Test Model 
The binomial model is implicitly used in all single-case studies in which the level of 
competence is estimated for a set of dichotomously scored items as the relative fre- 
quency of correct responses. Even for a narrowly defined domain of language pro- 
cessing, items will be of different difficulty rendering the "ability model" interpre- 
tation of the binomial model untenable, in which all items in a test must have identical 
difficulty for any subject tested. Otherwise, the relative frequency of correct responses 
is not a proper ability level estimate. Luckily, there is also an "item sampling model" 
version of the binomial model (Lord & Novick, 1968, p. 250; Klauer, 1987), allowing 
for possibly different item difficulties. This version requires that for every subject 
examined a new random sample of items without or with replacement has to be drawn 
from the finite/infinite item domain. This presents no unsurmountable problem when 
using a PC for item presentation and test administration.

Methodological and Statistical Considerations 
65 
2-3.3. Operational Definition of Dissociations 
Willmes (1990) has shown how the criterion-referenced measurement approach em- 
ploying the binomial model can be utilized in combination with Fisher's exact (ran- 
domization) test for 2-by-2 tables (discussed in section 1.4) to give an operational 
definition and a worked-out procedure to detect different types/degrees of (double) 
dissociations in performance as introduced conceptually by Shallice (1988, Chapter 
10). For graded scores or metric responses, see Willmes (1995). 
For a classical dissociation, performance in some task A must be well below the 
normal range and must be much inferior to performance in task B, which in term 
must fall within the normal range, possibly close to the premorbid level of compe- 
tence. For tasks solved very well by almost all normal subjects, therefore, a very high 
mastery level of Pc - 0.99 should be adopted for task B. In case of substantial 
systematic variability in competence for normal subjects Pc may be fixed at some 
quantile (25th, 50th) of the score distribution for normal controls, if available. The 
individual competence level Pi for task A must be much lower (for example, at chance 
level for multiple-choice items). In any case, it must be demonstrated using inferential 
statistics with sufficient test power (Cohen, 1988) that there is a significant difference 
in competence. 
A strong dissociation does not require performance on task B to be within the 
normal range. For a task in which non-brain-damaged subjects show ceiling perform- 
ance, one can set mastery at a competence level no less than, for example, Pc = 0.80 
for the task assessing the (supposedly) spared function. The competence for the other 
task A has to be fixed at a considerably lower level, for example, at P0 = 1/m for an 
m-choice response format or at a reasonable, yet arbitrarily chosen, value for free- 
response formats, for example, in production tasks. Again the numbers of items in 
tasks A and B must be large enough to reveal a real difference ~ = Pc-Po with sufficient 
statistical power. 
A trend dissociation denotes the weakest form of a reliable difference in individual 
competence among two tasks. In this case it is particularly mandatory to compute in 
advance whether some real difference ~ = PB-PA in competence can reliably be dem- 
onstrated with the actual number of items chosen for both tasks. In the subsequent 
statistical evaluation of the data a (trend) dissociation should be taken to hold only if 
there is a significant difference at the assumed type I error level and if the estimated 
effect size, that is, estimated difference in competence, is about at least as large as 
the effect size parameter value ~ for which the sample size computation has been 
carried out. 
2-3.4. Double Dissociations 
For a valid demonstration of a double dissociation, Shallice (1988, p. 234) has argued 
that in order to safeguard against resource artifacts it is not sufficient to reveal two 
complementary dissociations on two patients. Rather, it must be demonstrated in 
addition that both patients exhibit a complementary and significant difference between 

66 
Klaus Willmes 
both tasks. Therefore, the empirical hypothesis of a double dissociation implies a 
conjunction of four one-sided statistical alternative hypotheses. As Westermann and 
Hager (1983, 1986) have argued, there is no need for a type I error reduction because 
of multiple testing, in case one is only willing, say, to accept the empirical hypothesis 
to be corroborated if all four tests yield significant results at the prespecified type I 
error level of oL = 0.05. Instead, paying attention to statistical power considerations, 
the number of items per task must be sufficiently large to warrant enough statistical 
power for a type II error reduction to [3/4 for each of the four individual tests. 
2-3.5. Inherent Item Difficulties 
Another methodological point to be discussed in this context is the problem of poten- 
tial differences in the "inherent" difficulty of two tasks (Shallice, 1988; Blanken, 
1988; Sergent, 1988), the term "inherent" indicating that within the particular proc- 
essing model assumed to hold, one task has to, for example, rely on more and/or more 
demanding crucial processing steps than the other one, thus requiring more resources 
or competence, finally leading to higher overt task difficulty. Without a computation- 
ally explicit theory of task performance, this notion of inherent difficulty must remain 
somewhat vague, though. The difficulty argument is particularly important in those 
instances in which performance is poorer on the supposedly more demanding task and 
when the reverse pattern of performance has not been observed so far. The problem 
is made more complicated in those (frequent) instances in which normal subjects 
exhibit perfect performance on both (language) tasks. We have argued (Huber, Will- 
mes, & G6ddenhenrich, 1988) that in those instances it may be informative to look 
at data obtained from a (clinical) sample of (aphasic) patients--possibly fulfilling more 
or less detailed inclusion criteria--in order to learn about the "average" task difficulty 
and the frequency of dissociations in performance (for a limited approach to estimating 
this frequency see Bates, Appelbaum, & Allard, 1991). 
2-4. INFERENTIAL 
STATISTICAL 
TESTS FOR 
SINGLE-CASE 
STUDIES 
2-4.1. Random Sampling versus Random Assignment 
The great majority of statistical tests employed in single-case studies in neurolinguis- 
tics are conceptually wrong. Tests for contingency tables (2-by-2 tables or others) 
relating the value of the test statistic to the (central) chi-square distribution with the 
appropriate number of degrees of freedom as well as t-tests, analysis of variance F- 
tests, or other parametric tests, all rely on the notion of random sampling from some 
(infinite) population, mostly requiring the observations to be independent as well. 
Edgington (1995) has repeatedly argued for more than two decades that these sampling 
assumptions are not tenable, even for multisubject experiments in most of general 
psychology, and that they are not required in experimental work. Random assignment 
of subjects from any kind of sample to experimental conditions or random assignment 

2 
Methodological and Statistical Considerations 
67 
of adminstration times to experimental conditions in repeated measures designs is 
sufficient for drawing valid inferences about contrasting effects of experimental con- 
ditions on some response measures from the results of randomization tests. Inferences 
about effects of experimental manipulations for other subjects must be nonstatistical 
in nature, without a basis in probability. Hypotheses tested by randomization tests 
refer to individual subjects even when many subjects participate in an experiment. 
Likewise, psychological theories--particularly those in cognitive (neuro)psychol- 
ogymoften explain phenomena in terms of processes within individuals. 
2-4.2. Randomization Tests for Single-Subject Studies 
The application of statistical tests to single-subject experimental data cannot be jus- 
tified on the basis of any random-sampling model. But, as Edgington (1995) has 
argued, any randomization test that can be applied to some multiple-subjects design 
with random assignment to experimental conditions can be applied as well to data 
from a single-subject design. In these designs, administration times are randomly as- 
signed to experimental conditions in some fashion. Willmes (1990, 1995) has outlined 
this approach in the context of single-subject aphasia therapy research for the most 
basic types of hypotheses concerning the comparison of two types of tasks, each 
(mostly) composed of a set of homogeneous items, or of two experimental conditions 
for the same set of items. Randomization tests are available and well known for 
dichotomous item scorings (Fisher's exact test for 2-by-2 tables; the exact version of 
the sign test), graded scores (exact versions of the Mann-Whitney U-test for ranks 
and the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test), and continuous measures such as reaction times 
(randomization test analogs of the independent and paired observations t-test; see 
Edgington, 1995). 
The most simple situation is one in which the performance of one subject has to 
be compared for just two different sets of items. The number of administration times 
for each item set is fixed at the number of items in that setmpossibly different for 
both sets--and within that restriction there is random assignment of administration 
instances to item sets. In other instances, there may be some additional blocking of 
application times. The typical null hypothesis tested is as follows: for each of the 
administration instances, the single subject's response is independent of the impact of 
the respective item set (experimental treatment) presented at that particular instance. 
Or, put differently: the association between administration instances and responses is 
the same as it would have been for any alternative assignment. There is no need for 
an independence assumption among responses. Only the weaker requirement for in- 
terchangeability of responses has to be fulfilled. However, rejection of the null hy- 
pothesis may be caused not only by differences between the item sets but also by 
differential carryover effects. Such an effect is present whenever the subject's response 
to an item from a particular item set is influenced not only by how many items 
preceded that item (a nonproblematic general carryover effect like a practice effect 
or fatigue), but also on the particular characteristics of the item sets, from which 
items were administered at each of the preceding item presentations. Although these 

68 
Klaus Wiilmes 
differential carryover effects can never be ruled out in principle in any single-subject 
research design, well-known experimental control measures can be exercised to keep 
them at a minimum. Edgington (1995) also presents some worked-out examples and 
applications for several types of restricted randomization designs encountered in be- 
havior modification studies such as intervention and withdrawal designs or multiple 
baseline designs (see also Onghena & Edgington, 1994). 
2-4.3. Computational Aspects 
The theoretical basis for randomization tests was already laid out some six decades 
ago (Pitman, 1937, 1938; see also Fisher, 1935). But these tests require heavy com- 
putations, except for very small data sets. The test statistic has to be evaluated for 
every admissible permutation of the responses observed under the respective null 
hypothesis in order to determine the observed significance level (p-value). The actual 
conduct of randomization tests has become feasible only quite recently with the avail- 
ability of efficient special-purpose PC-program packages (StatXact, SCRT, RAN- 
DIBM; for references, see Edgington, 1995, pp. 398-399, or PITMAN by Dallal, 
1988). Some exact tests have also been incorporated in general statistical packages 
such as SPSS or SAS. Nevertheless, randomization tests have rarely been employed 
in cognitive neurolinguistic studies. 
2-4.4. Statistical Demonstration of Dissociations 
The detection of the different types of dissociations and double dissociations (classical, 
strong, trend), which is so important for theorizing in cognitive neurolinguistics, can 
be accomplished entirely with randomization tests. This has been demonstrated in 
detail for dichotomously scored items and outlined for other types of responses by 
Willmes (1990, 1995). For dichotomous item scores, a large number of the inferential 
statistical problems involved can be approached with just the exact version of the sign 
test (or the exact version of the McNemar test) and Fisher's exact test. However, these 
tests have to be augmented by power considerations in accord with reflections on a 
sufficient number of items required to detect true differences in performance or to 
corroborate the (near) identity of impairments or achievements (for example, in the 
case of associated disorders). 
2-4.5. Example 
An exemplary application of this approach to single-case studies in number (word) 
transcoding is shortly presented for the data of two patients reported in Table 1. From 
one particular influential model of number (word) processing (McCloskey, 1992), one 
can deduce that transcoding either spoken verbal numbers or written number words 
into written Arabic numbers is assumed to rest on the same syntactic processing 
component. The demonstration of a double dissociation between both types of tran- 
scoding tasks would call into question this central feature of the model. Since 

2 
Methodological and Statistical Considerations 
69 
the same two- and three-digit Arabic numerical stimuli were used for testing, the 
randomization version of the McNemar test (that is, the exact sign test) was used 
for comparisons between tasks in one patient and Fisher's exact test for the (one- 
tailed) comparison between subjects per task. Before carrying out the study, one can 
examine whether the chosen number of items from the domain (k = 78) would be 
sufficient to detect significant differences with sufficient statistical power. Applica- 
tion of the PC program STAT-POWER (Bavry, 1991) reveals that already for a me- 
dium effect size (cf. Cohen, 1988, Chapter 5), which has to be present for a proper 
strong dissociation, the chosen number of items is large enough to detect an existing 
difference of that size. (It has to be noted that for a priori power considerations the 
random-sampling model is more convenient.) As indicated by the same program, the 
item number is also sufficient for Fisher's exact test for the comparison of two sub- 
jects. 
Comparing the off-diagonal entries for patient 1 (35 vs 0) using the exact sign test 
reveals a highly significant difference in performance (p < .0001, one-tailed) with a 
large effect size estimate (according to the criteria put forward by Cohen, 1988) and 
an empirical power estimate of 1-[3 = 1.00. In addition, the perfect spoken verbal to 
Arabic transcoding performance is compatible with a mastery level of Pc = 0.99 
according to the binomial model, suggesting a classical dissociation in performance. 
Patient 2 revealed a reverse pattern of performance with a highly significant difference, 
a large effect size and a power estimate of 1.00 as well. Since the 95%-confidence 
interval around the ability estimate of 65/78 = 0.833 for transcoding written number 
words covers a criterion competence of "only" Pc = 0.90, this dissociation is labeled 
"strong." 
Comparison of performances between patients using Fisher's exact test as computed 
in the StatXact package (Mehta & Patel, 1995) yielded highly significant one-sided 
differences (p < .0001) with power estimates of at least 0.99 and a medium to large 
effect size for written verbal input and a large effect size for spoken verbal input. 
Since there are no generally accepted proposals for classifying different degrees of 
double dissociations, I propose to call this pattern of performances a strong double 
dissociation according to the weakest single dissociation encountered.

2-5. FUTURE 
OUTLOOK 
It is impossible to make any precise predictions about the course of development of 
the whole cognitive neurolinguistic and neuropsychological field. One can, however, 
be reasonably convinced that as the evidence from cognitive neurolinguistic single- 
case (and small-group) studies accumulates and language processing models become 
more elaborate, both areas will continue to be of mutual benefit to each other. The 
advances in the field will also crucially depend on the refinement of (experimental) 
language assessment procedures, functional brain-imaging technology with increased 
spatial and temporal resolution, and a growing concern for psychometric and statistical 
matters. Neural network modeling and simulation will offer unexpected and productive 
findings, both when running intact and when "lesioned" systematically or randomly. 
There are, for example, models of reading aloud by Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, and 
Haller (1993) as well as Hinton and Shallice (1991), and of visual object naming by 
Plaut and Shallice (1993). Cognitive neurolinguistics will also be increasingly helpful 
for planning and evaluating language therapy, although a theory of cognitively ori- 
ented remediation of language impairments and disabilities is still largely lacking and 
not without basic conceptual problems (cf. Caramazza, 1989; Riddoch & Humphreys, 
1994).

Evaluation of Language 
Comprehension and Production 
by Formal Test Batteries

Assessment of language may be conducted to further knowledge about a language 
disorder and underlying processes, but more commonly, testing is conducted for 
the patient's benefit. In a patient-centered approach, the goals for testing include 
determining the normalcy of the patient's language, and, if a language impair- 
ment exists, determining the cause of the language impairment. A patient- 
centered approach will also define the patient's language deficits and ability to 
communicate in everyday situations. Age, sex, culture, languages spoken, and 
education have all been shown to affect test performance, and such factors need 
to be considered in the development of new tests and the collection of normative 
data. 
Assessment of language is perhaps one of the most highly developed components of 
neuropsychological assessment due to the early development of aphasiology in the 
late 19th century (Benton, 1994). Despite the well-documented early development of 
aphasiology, a review of recent literature suggests that there is not a widespread in- 
terest in standardized language assessment; much of the recent psychometric research 
deals with nonlanguage functions (cf. the Journal of the International Neuropsycho- 
logical Society, 1996). However, when language assessment methods are scrutinized, 
significant problems are revealed. Some of these problems relate to the fact that the

purpose of language assessment has evolved over time. Neurodiagnostic testing, for 
the most part, has replaced the need to localize lesions associated with language def- 
icits. Also, the language-impaired patient population continues to change (Horner et 
al., 1995). The current aphasic population in North America is older, has more medical 
problems, and is more culturally diverse than it was 20 years ago. New normative 
data will need to be collected and some tests may lose their application. This chapter 
will review rationales for language testing, language tests most frequently described 
in the literature, limitations of tests, and areas of future research. 
3-1. WHY 
USE FORMAL 
TESTS 
OF LANGUAGE? 
Clinical assessment requires that the clinician first determine the reasons for the as- 
sessment of the patient's speech and language. A rationale for testing will allow the 
clinician the most judicious selection of formal tests. Without a rationale, the testing 
will be inefficient and possibly ineffective. Inefficiency can result when the clinician 
administers more tests than is necessary to meet the goals of the examination. The 
testing may also be ineffective. The clinician may review the test results and realize 
that they are meaningless, because the tests that were chosen do not meet the goals 
of the examination. For example, Caplan (1995) states that one goal of language 
assessment is to describe the patient's language disorder in relation to the major com- 
ponents of the language processing system; however, according to Caplan, the majority 
of existing aphasia batteries do not allow for this type of analysis. The following 
sections will review the most common rationales for conducting language testing. Both 
limitations of formal language batteries and the need for future research can be elu- 
cidated within this framework. 
3-2. AN ACADEMIC-EXPERIMENTAL 
FOR 
TESTING 
RATIONALE 
In some clinical settings, one purpose for testing a patient's language abilities may be 
an academic one, that is, for the examiner to understand more about a particular 
disorder. Much of the information about speech and language disorders was obtained 
in academic settings where clinicians were oriented toward learning more about their 
patient's difficulties for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge and sharing this 
knowledge with their colleagues through grand rounds. Because of developments in 
neurodiagnostic testing, there is less need to infer lesion location through language 
testing; however, there is still a need to conduct research to correlate functional neu- 
rodiagnostic tests such as SPECT, functional MRI, and PET scan findings with findings 
from neuropsychological tests, including performance on tests of language (Benton, 
1994). Also, neurodiagnostic techniques showing functional change in cerebral func- 
tion associated with diaschisis, restoration of function over time, and alterations in 

3 
Clinical Assessment Strategies 
73 
between-hemispheric communication could be correlated with repeated language 
measures (Benton, 1994). 
3-3. A PATIENT-CENTERED 
RATIONALE 
A second rationale for testing that is common to all settings is focused on improving 
the patient's quality of life. The primary concern is to answer the question: "what 
difference will the results obtained from this test make in the quality of the patient's 
life?" Some specific goals of testing fall under a patient-centered approach. The goals 
are described in the sections that follow. 
3-3.1. To Determine Normalcy 
The results of testing may help determine whether the patient's speech and language 
abilities are within normal limits in comparison to his or her peer group. The patient's 
peer group may be defined as others of the same age, the same sex, the same edu- 
cational level, the same socioeconomic status, or any combination of these patient 
characteristics. Determination of normalcy of language abilities may be important for 
the patient, and perhaps his or her family and friends. In addition, legal and employ- 
ment decisions may be influenced by the results of the language evaluation. 
There is no reliable method available for determining whether a patient is normal 
or aphasic using a standardized language battery. Wertz, Deal, and Robinson (1984) 
found that the Western Aphasia Battery classified five out of 45 patients as having 
normal language, whereas the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination classified 
these same patients as having aphasia. Brauer, McNeil, Duffy, Keith, and Collins 
(1989) present discriminant weights that were found to be accurate for differentiat- 
ing normal subjects from aphasics; however, the same discriminant weights were 
not able to differentiate normal performance from that of malingerers. Variability in 
patient characteristics may account for some of the inconsistent results in determining 
normalcy. 
Ardilla (1995) argued that neuropsychological tests, including language tests, have 
standards that were determined by the performance of middle-class North Americans, 
and that these standards may not be accurate for other cultures with different values, 
education, cognitive styles, and possible brain organization. He recommends that tests 
must be standardized and norms obtained for different age, cultural, and educational 
groups. As one example of the need for accurate normative data for language tests, a 
group of researchers from the University of Cincinnati (Neils et al., 1995) evaluated 
the performance of elderly subjects on the Boston Naming Test and found that the 
age of the person tested, along with the person's level of education and living envi- 
ronment (e.g., nursing home or independent living), made a significant difference in 
test performance. Many of the persons tested who were determined normal according 
to other standards, but who were elderly and had a limited education (6 to 9 years of 

74 
Jean Neils-Strunja~ 
formal education), obtained "abnormal" scores. Many nursing home residents who 
were judged to have normal cognitive functioning by other methods also obtained 
abnormal scores. Another study (Randolph, Lansing, Ivnik, Cullum, & Hermann, 
1996) on the Boston Naming Test found that males score higher than females as the 
result of their performance on specific items. 
The majority of the language tests available were not developed or standardized 
for the culturally diverse, neurologically impaired population that is found in many 
clinical settings. Often, tests are translated from English to other languages without 
concern for all but the most superficial aspects of translation. For example, L6wenstein 
and Rupert (1992) examined the results obtained from the FAS Controlled Association 
Test given to Cuban Americans. They found that even though the FAS fluency test 
was administered in Spanish, the performance of many of the Spanish-speaking nor- 
mal elderly subjects would have placed them in the impaired range according to 
normative data obtained for English-speaking subjects. L6wenstein and Rupert spec- 
ulated that the inferior performance of the Cuban Americans may have been due to 
the frequency of the letters F, A, and S occurring less often as initial letters in Spanish 
than in English; however, many other more subtle factors such as the effect of bilin- 
gualism could have influenced the speed of word generation. 
Based on these studies and others like it, a clinician must compare the age, sex, 
educational level, living environment, language, and culture of the patient to the pop- 
ulation the norms were obtained from. This comparison is especially important when 
the test has been shown to be gender biased or influenced by other variables as in the 
case of the Boston Naming Test. L6wenstein, Arguelles, Arguelles, and Linn-Fuentes 
(1994) recommended methods of decreasing cross-cultural bias in testing by (1) con- 
structing tests that are more culture-fair and salient to diverse cultural groups; (2) 
modifying or discontinuing tests that are not salient or relevant to particular language/ 
cultural groups; and, (3) developing appropriate age-, education-, and culture-fair nor- 
mative databases. One test that is consistent with these recommendations is the Bilin- 
gual Aphasia Test (BAT; Paradis, 1993). The BAT has 60 language versions that are 
not direct translations but transpositions that are as linguistically and culturally equiv- 
alent as possible. In addition, each of the versions has been normed on native speakers 
in their respective countries. 
3-3.2. To Determine a Differential Diagnosis 
In some cases, knowledge of the patient's language may be helpful in the diagnosis 
of the patient's medical condition. Historically, before the availability of CT (and even 
more recently, MRI), language testing was more commonly used to identify the lo- 
cation of lesions associated with stroke. However, there still exist some cases where 
formal language assessment may be helpful to identify the presence of a disease 
process associated with "silent lesions" or neurochemical dysfunction that causes 
primary progressive aphasia (Kertesz, Caselli, Graff-Radford, & Miller, 1995), Pick's 
disease (Caselli, 1995), and early Alzheimer's disease (Grossman et al., 1995). Sass 
et al. (1992) found that results from the Boston Naming Test could predict whether 

3 
Clinical Assessment Strategies 
~/ 
the epileptogenic focus was in the left or right hemisphere in patients with medically 
intractable seizures. Still, for the majority of language-impaired patients, the diagnosis 
will be determined through neuroimaging and other medical tests. For these cases, it 
is still important to define language abilities and deficits. 
3-3.3. To Define Language Abilities and Deficits 
A particular patient's language problem may be so apparent that testing is not needed 
to determine normalcy. Instead, the language tests may be chosen to better define the 
problem. Definition of the language impairment allows the clinician to describe the 
language impairment to the patient's family, medical personal caring for the patient, 
and other clinicians. In addition, the test results often help the clinician determine 
which aspects of language should be addressed in language therapy conducted by a 
speech-language pathologist. There are three currently employed methods for defining 
language impairments related to aphasia: classification of aphasia types or syndromes, 
determination of overall severity of aphasia, and an information-processing approach. 
3-3.3.1. Aphasia Types or Syndromes 
Swindell, Holland, and Fromm (1984) found little agreement among aphasiologists in 
their clinical judgment of aphasia types (e.g., Broca's aphasia) and findings from the 
Western Aphasia Battery. Moreover, it has been determined that there is little agree- 
ment in classification of aphasia according to the two main tests used to classify 
aphasia: the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination and the Western Aphasia Battery 
(Wertz, Deal, & Robinson, 1984). A large percentage of patients are unclassifiable 
according to methods prescribed by the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Ben- 
ton, 1994). A relatively new assessment instrument, the Aphasia Diagnostic Profiles 
(ADP; Helm-Estabrooks, 1991), is reliable in aphasia type classification, according to 
its authors; other studies, such as those that have been conducted on the reliability 
and validity of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB; Kertesz, 1982) and the Boston 
Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE; Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983), are needed 
before clinicians select this measure over the WAB or the BDAE. Although there is 
no gold standard for determining aphasia syndromes, the use of syndrome labels re- 
mains the most common shorthand method for defining language impairment in both 
clinical situations and in research reports. 
3-3.3.2. Severity of Aphasia 
Several tests assess severity of language impairment, among them the Communicative 
Abilities in Daily Living (CADL; Holland, 1980) and the WAB. Severity of language 
impairment, in addition to being a useful descriptor, can also help the clinician deter- 
mine which language tests should be administered to the patient. Both patients with 
mild language impairments and patients with severe language impairments pose spe- 
cial problems to the examiner. The majority of formal language tests (e.g., Porch Index 

76 
Jean Neils-Strunjag 
of Communicative Ability, Revised Token Test) were developed for patients whose 
language is moderately impaired. 
3-3.3.3. Information-Processing Approach 
In this approach, language is conceptualized as a flow diagram in which a sequence 
of operations is activated on one or more levels of language. An information- 
processing approach begins with a model of the particular aspect of language in ques- 
tion (e.g., naming pictures, written production of single words written to dictation). 
The clinician then attempts to localize the deficit on the model through administering 
a series of tests selected to measure the integrity of processes represented on the 
model. One limitation of this approach is that it has been applied most often in case 
studies of very specific aspects of language such as naming pictures (Hillis, 1994). 
However, Caplan (1995) has developed a psycholinguistically oriented language as- 
sessment battery that operationalizes an information-processing approach and includes 
a comprehensive analysis of language, from the lexical level to the discourse level. 
The Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language (PAL) is "currently being used for 
research purposes and may become available to clinicians in the next few years" 
(p. 97). The PAL consists of 27 subtests, including measures of reading and writing. 
The examiner determines which subtests are performed abnormally, and then makes in- 
ferences about the associated language processing components and whether input com- 
ponents are normal. Secondary breakdowns are also determined, that is, components 
of language that are impaired because they are dependent on primary components. 
All three methods of defining language impairment are useful, but for different 
purposes. The determination of aphasia syndromes is especially useful in medical 
settings where communication among neuropsychologists, neurologists, and speech- 
language pathologists is important. Also, in cases where a particular syndrome label 
neatly describes the patient's language deficits, the label may be useful to include in 
a research report. However, for any in-depth study of language, for patients who show 
a very specific language impairment in which a processing component is impaired in 
isolation, or for unusual profiles of language impairment, an information-processing 
approach is the preferred method. Research is needed to improve reliability of as- 
signing aphasia syndromes; also, as indicated by Caplan, further research is needed 
to test "construct validity, sensitivity, and clinical applicability" (p. 97) of the PAL. 
A measure of severity is an essential supplement to syndrome identification in a patient 
who is recovering from aphasia or in a patient whose language is progressively de- 
clining. A severity rating might also be helpful in assigning patients to language 
treatment groups. Although several standardized batteries have become available for 
the severely impaired patient, information on the validity of these measures and their 
clinical utility is just becoming available (Helm-Estabrooks, Ramsberger, Morgan, & 
Nicholas, 1989; Cunningham, Farrow, Davies, & Lincoln, 1995). Measures for pa- 
tients with mild language impairments are needed. Tests used to define the patient's 
language abilities and deficits may be limited in their ability to describe the patient's 
use of language for communication purposes.

Clinical Assessment Strategies 
77 
3-3.4. To Determine the Patient's Ability to Use 
Language Communicatively 
It is logical to question whether the results of testing help to determine the patient's 
ability to function independently. For example, can the patient communicate on the 
telephone and negotiate shopping independently? One test that attempts to fulfill this 
purpose is the test of Communicative Abilities in Daily Living (Holland, 1980). How- 
ever, Lezak (1995) warns that the severity estimate derived from a standardized bat- 
tery, even the CADL, may underestimate a patient's ability to communicate in every- 
day situations because contextual cues, routines, and familiarity with vocabulary are 
qualities of everyday communication that are difficult to replicate in a standardized 
examination (Monroe, 1985). For example, Lambrecht and Marshall (1983) report that 
it is not uncommon for a patient to be unable to point to a cigarette on a test but to 
produce a package of Camels when asked "Have you got a cigarette?" 
Patients with right hemisphere lesions and the majority of patients with traumatic 
brain injuries have problems with communication more so than with language. One 
aspect of communication is discourse comprehension, which can be measured with 
the Discourse Comprehension Test (Brookshire & Nicholas, 1993). In this test, the 
patient listens to spoken paragraphs and answers yes-no questions about the para- 
graphs. Tompkins, Baumgaertner, Lehman, and Fossett (1995) suggested that patients 
with right hemisphere brain damage have poor discourse comprehension because they 
have difficulty suppressing irrelevant or incompatible information. Further research 
needs to be conducted to determine if discourse comprehension is more predictive of 
communication abilities in everyday situations for certain patient groups (e.g., mild 
aphasics, patients with right hemisphere deficits, and patients with traumatic brain 
injuries) than results from more broad standardized tests of language. 
3-4. REVIEW 
OF TESTS 
Standardized tests of language fall into three general categories: screening tests, com- 
prehensive tests of language functioning, and tests of specific language abilities. 
Screening tests will not be reviewed here because the usefulness of even the most 
highly regarded screening tests has been questioned (Benton, 1994; Lezak, 1995). 
Subtests of standardized batteries, clinical judgment (Lezak, 1995), and consideration 
for why a language evaluation should be undertaken are effective alternative methods 
for determining which patients should undergo a complete evaluation of language. 
3-4.1. Comprehensive Tests of Language Functioning 
Porch Index of Communicative Ability (PICA; Porch, 1971, 1981) The purpose of 
this test is to quantify language comprehension, language production, reading, writing, 
gesture, object awareness, and copying. Spontaneous conversation is not addressed. 
The PICA is limited as a measure of auditory comprehension (Haber, 1988; Lezak, 

78 
Jean Neiis-Strunja~, 
1995) and, indirectly, posterior temporal brain dysfunction (Metter, Reige, Hanson, 
Kuhl, & Phelps, 1984). Because of the PICA's discrete scoring system, the clinician 
can readminister the PICA over time and measure change as a result of some treatment 
or therapy. The test is scored using one of the most elaborate scoring systems in 
neurolinguistic assessment. The scores vary qualitatively and quantitatively according 
to accuracy, the need for cues, completeness, speed of responding, and whether the 
patient has motoric limitations. Those who understand the scoring system, and are 
adept at using it, unanimously agree that it is the most thorough system for describing 
responses (Haber, 1988). Haber suggests that it is possible to use this scoring system 
with other more efficient tests of aphasia. This test is not recommended for clinicians 
who have budgetary concerns because the test itself and the recommended training 
course are expensive compared to other comparable tests. The PICA is not useful in 
determining normalcy of language functions because it is not sensitive to mild aphasia 
(Webb, 1995). Also, the prognostic usefulness of the test for predicting recovery from 
aphasia has been challenged (Fleming, Hubbard, Schinsky, & Datta, 1982; Webb, 
1995; Wertz, Dronkers, & Hume, 1992). The PICA is recommended for clinicians 
who have a large practice of patients with moderate language impairments as a result 
of a stroke. 
Communicative Abilities in Daily Living (CADL; Holland, 1980) The purpose 
of this test is to assess the functional communication skills of individuals with aphasia. 
Normative data are available for elderly institutionalized and noninstitutionalized pop- 
ulations. In order to administer this test, common objects must be collected or pur- 
chased (e.g., a white laboratory coat, a stethoscope). The test offers a single score of 
functioning that can be compared to a cutoff score. There are also 10 categories for 
which scores can be derived, but the number of items in each category is either too 
few to draw meaningful conclusions, or the categories are too broad (e.g., reading, 
writing, calculating) or too obtuse for interpretation (e.g., performance of sequenced 
behavior, recognition of cause-effect relationships). The results of this test might be 
best thought of as a general indicator of normalcy of communication and a screening 
tool for further exploration of communication problems (Monroe, 1985). It is rec- 
ommended that the results of the testing be discussed with others with whom the 
patient interacts to validate the findings. 
Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE; Goodglass & Kaplan, 1983) 
The BDAE provides diagnostic information about the normalcy of language functions 
and aphasia syndromes (e.g., Broca's aphasia). There is a revised version (1983) of 
the original (1972); the actual test revisions, however, are minor. Some items have 
been reordered, and the organization of the test record booklet has been changed. The 
new version of the BDAE allows for scaled scores to be represented in percentiles, 
and normative data is also included. The older version only provides z-scores, which 
can be compared to z-score profiles of aphasia syndromes illustrated in the test manual. 
The BDAE is highly recommended for any clinician who sees aphasic patients. It is 
frequently cited in the literature; therefore, the results obtained from any one patient 

3 
Clinical Assessment Strategies 
79 
can often be compared to published case studies and research on groups of patients. 
In addition, it is relatively inexpensive and easy to store because only a test manual, 
test booklet, and a set of stimulus cards are required. Normative data for individual 
subtests allow examiners to give them separately as needed, which may account for 
the battery's popularity (Abeles, 1995; Lezak, 1995). Van Demark (1982) reported 
that posttreatment BDAE scores could be predicted with three subtest scores from the 
BDAE: Confrontation Naming, Complex Ideational Materials, and Body Part Identi- 
fication. Brookshire and Nicholas (1994) found that by using additional measures of 
connected speech (in addition to the BDAE's cookie theft picture) higher test-retest 
correlations could be obtained in measures of words per minute, correct information 
units (CIUs) per minute, and percent correct information units (calculated by dividing 
the number of CIUs in a speech sample by the number of words in the sample). 
Supplementary stimulus items that Brookshire and Nicholas (1994) tested were the 
picnic scene picture from the Western Aphasia Battery, other action pictures, and 
open-ended questions, such as "Tell me where you live and describe it to me." 
Western Aphasia Battery (WAB: Kertesz, 1982) The WAB is a comprehensive 
test of language that allows clinicians to classify aphasic patients according to aphasia 
syndromes and to determine normalcy of language. An overall score of severity of 
language impairment (i.e., the Aphasia Quotient) can also be derived. In addition, 
scores on tests of reading, writing, and cognitive measures can be obtained. Common 
objects (e.g., screwdriver, matches) must be collected or purchased. Two translations 
of earlier versions of the battery are available in Spanish and French (Lezak, 1995). 
The WAB is similar to the BDAE in that patients can be classified to an aphasia 
type or syndrome with both measures. The differences are that the WAB is clearer in 
its directions and easier to score than the BDAE; also, the stimulus items of the WAB 
will be more familiar to most patients than the stimulus items of the BDAE. (Compare 
the picnic scene picture to the cookie theft picture.) On the other hand, the BDAE 
contains more challenging items to test auditory comprehension than the WAB. There- 
fore, when the examiner aims to capture subtle auditory comprehension problems, the 
BDAE is recommended over the WAB. Both the WAB and the BDAE incorporate 
ratings of fluency based on spontaneous speech samples. Trupe (1984) studied the 
reliability of the spontaneous speech ratings on the WAB and describes an improved 
scoring system for the content in spontaneous speech. Trupe (1984) reported, however, 
poor reliability in judging fluency of speech, and recommends the BDAE rating of 
fluency which, unlike the unitary scale of fluency on the WAB, is rated with multiple 
scales. 
Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis of Aphasia (MTDDA; Schuell, 1965) 
The MTDDA is a comprehensive test of aphasia and was developed by one of the 
most prominent aphasiologists of the 20th century, the late Hildred Schuell. The tests 
are grouped into five sections: tests for auditory disturbances, tests for visual and 
reading disturbances, tests for speech and language disturbances, tests for visuomo- 
tor and writing disturbances, and tests for disturbances of numerical relations and 

80 
Jean Neils-Strunja~ 
arithmetic processes. The sections have limited value for describing areas of deficit. 
For example, "repeating digits" and "repeating sentences" are in the "auditory dis- 
turbances section," although these tests could also be considered measures of repeti- 
tion or immediate memory. Individual subtests may provide clinically useful material; 
for example, sections on using money may be helpful in planning remediation; and 
indeed, clinicians frequently select individual subtests for administration (Webb, 
1995). The test does provide a means for classifying patients; however, the categories, 
which are based on severity and accompanying symptoms, are idiosyncratic and gen- 
erally unacceptable (Lezak, 1995). 
Multilingual Aphasia Examination (Benton & Hamsher, 1989) The Multilin- 
gual Aphasia Examination is a collection of short tests that evaluates the presence, 
severity, and qualitative aspects of aphasia disorders. It was developed from its parent 
battery, the Neurosensory Center Comprehensive Examination of Aphasia (Lezak, 
1995). There are nine separate procedures, and along with two ratings of the patient's 
speech production and written production, 11 scores are obtained. Translations of this 
test are available in French, Italian, German, and Spanish as well as English, but 
norms are only widely available in English and Spanish. The battery includes useful 
measures of single-word spelling in three output modalities: spelling with block letters, 
written spelling, and oral spelling. Two of the tests, the controlled oral word associ- 
ation test and the Token test, are types of measures commonly used as supplementary 
tests of language. Individual subtests are useful snapshots, but the overall battery does 
not include a range of items to assess language comprehension and production along 
a continuum of complexity--a quality considered important for comprehensive apha- 
sia batteries (Webb, 1995). 
3-4.2. Tests of Specific Language Abilities 
Jackson and Tompkins (1991) surveyed 58 experienced aphasiologists and found that 
98% of the respondents used the Boston Naming Test, 74% used the Word Fluency 
Test, and 62% used the Revised Token Test. These were the three most commonly 
used tests of specific aspects of auditory-verbal language and will be reviewed in the 
following sections. 
The Boston Naming Test (BNT; Kaplan, Goodglass, & Weintraub, 1976, 1978, 
1983) The BNT is one of the most frequently used tests for determining confron- 
tational picture-naming abilities in patients with suspected focal or diffuse brain dam- 
age. The most recent version contains 60 line-drawn pictures that the patient attempts 
to name spontaneously; if the response is incorrect, the patient may receive cues. 
Patterns of errors may be examined to further investigate impaired processes that 
might underlie the anomia (Kremin, 1990; Strub & Black, 1988). The test can poten- 
tially yield a significant amount of information about a patient's language abilities in 
a short period of time with little effort on the part of the examiner. At the same time, 
the test is one of the most heavily criticized for the directions the manual provides 

3 
Clinical Assessment Strategies 
81 
(Jackson & Tompkins, 1991; Nicholas, Brookshire, MacLennan, Schumacher, & Por- 
razzo, 1989), its validity (Jackson & Tompkins, 1991), score stability or test-retest 
reliability (Jackson & Tompkins, 1991), and the normative data that it provides (Neils 
et al., 1995). Examiners should refer to normative data in published research articles 
(e.g., Neils et al., 1995). 
3-4.3. Word-Fluency Measures 
Word-fluency measures are often used in diagnostic evaluations of neurologically im- 
paired patients because they are one of the most sensitive to neurological impairment 
and can differentiate a number of patient groups (aphasic, right-brain-injured, trau- 
matic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease) from normal subjects (Adamovich & 
Henderson, 1984; Wertz, Dronkers, & Shubitowski, 1986). These measures, however, 
are less useful for discriminating among brain-damaged patient groups (Wertz, Dron- 
kers, & Shubitowski, 1986). The most frequently used controlled association word- 
fluency tasks include the animal naming subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia 
Examination (BDAE) (Goodglass & Kaplan, 1972); the initial letter (F, A, and S) 
word-fluency subtest of the Neurosensory Center Comprehensive Examination for 
Aphasia (NCCEA; Spreen & Benton, 1977) and the initial letter (S, T, P, and C) 
word-fluency measures by Wertz, 1979 (Adamovich & Henderson, 1984). The animal 
naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery is also frequently used and is identical 
to the BDAE subtest. In relatively mild patients who do not have oral motor impair- 
ment, fluency tests are efficient measures of documenting one component of language 
production. 
Revised Token Test (RTT; McNeil & Prescott, 1978) 
This is a test of auditory 
processing and comprehension. Some of the subtests also assess auditory memory 
because they involve lengthy commands (Caplan, 1995; Curtiss, Jackson, Kempler, 
Hanson, & Metter, 1986). The patient is required to follow commands using small 
plastic "tokens" that are of different colors and shapes. This test also employs essen- 
tially the same scoring system as the PICA; thus, it shares this strength. The standard 
Revised Token Test was designed to improve on older versions of the Token Test by 
increasing the number of items and by standardizing the procedures. This is a long 
test, especially in light of the fact that it is a specific measure of auditory processing. 
In an attempt to make the testing procedures of the RTT more efficient, Arvedson, 
McNeil, and West (1985) examined shortened forms of the RTT and found that "the 
five-item mean overall scores are so close to the standard RTT that a direct substitution 
can be made" (p. 62). With the five-item procedure, the examiner only administers 
the first five items of each of the 10 subtests. It would be useful to compare the 
reliability and validity of the shortened version of the RTT proposed by Arvedson et 
al. (1985) with older versions of the Token Test. Both of these shorter versions are 
recommended over the administration of the complete Revised Token Test, except in 
cases where auditory processing is the primary or only suspected impairment.

3-5. SUMMARY 
AND FUTURE 
OUTLOOK 
Clinical assessment of language in an adult patient may be conducted to learn more 
about language disorders, to provide a service to the patient, or both. Standardized 
batteries and specific tests of language should be selected according to the rationale(s) 
for testing. The patient-centered rationales for testing include determination of the 
normalcy of language, the cause of the language impairment, definition of the language 
deficits and abilities, and the patient's ability to communicate in everyday situations. 
Definition of the patient's language deficits and abilities may be viewed according to 
type of aphasia syndrome, severity of aphasia, and an information-processing ap- 
proach. A review of the most commonly used standardized tests of language suggests 
that word-fluency measures, the BNT, the Revised Token Test, and the BDAE are best 
at determining normalcy of language functions. These same tests, along with tests of 
memory, would be most useful for differential diagnosis of primary progressive apha- 
sia and Pick's disease from normal language functioning and early Alzheimer's disease 
(Kertesz et al., 1995). The majority of the standardized language batteries are useful 
for defining aspects of language production and comprehension. The WAB and the 
B DAE are most useful for defining aphasia syndromes although future modifications 
of these batteries are required to resolve conflicts in the disparity in syndrome labels 
assigned. Along with these batteries, the PICA and the CADL provide severity ratings, 
but they fail to capture mild language impairments. Other batteries, such as the Boston 
Assessment of Severe Aphasia and the Assessment of Communicative Effectiveness 
in Severe Aphasia, may prove to be more effective in defining the language abilities 
of severely impaired patients than other tests of aphasia, although comparison studies 
are needed. Beyond a description of language deficits and abilities, the clinician should 
obtain a measure from which the patient's ability to function in everyday situations 
can be inferred. Although the CADL was developed for this purpose, clinical im- 
pression (Monroe, 1985; Lezak, 1995) suggests that it falls short. Discourse compre- 
hension may be a better tool for inferring the patient's ability to function in everyday 
situations; however, research is needed to test this hypothesis. Finally, in all future 
research, the patient population that a test or normative data will be used for needs 
to be considered. Such factors as age, sex, culture, languages spoken, and education 
have all been shown to affect test performance in a profound way.

Psychological and Psycholinguistic Methods 
in Neurolinguistics

Neuropsychological research in the past century has increasingly relied upon a 
functional definition of language processing whose broad outlines are now widely 
accepted. Neurolinguistic research within this functionalist framework has three 
main goals: to enumerate and classify the fundamental components of the human 
language system (mainly by studying damaged language systems); to study how 
those units normally function; and to model our understanding of the complex 
process of language use in a compact and comprehensible way. In this chapter, 
examples of various common methods for achieving these goals are presented 
and discussed. 
What is language? What are its natural components? How are those components struc- 
tured, interconnected, and processed? How is language structure instantiated and proc- 
essed in the brain? How does that structure develop? How does it support the different 
input and output modalities of language? What rules or principles determine how 
language processing operates on the structure? How is that processing affected by 
extralinguistic resource demands? How is it affected by neurological damage? 
These are some of the questions addressed by neurolinguistics. In order to answer 
such a broad spectrum of questions, neurolinguists have developed an equally broad 
spectrum of research methods. In this chapter we will consider those methods that

Chris Westbury 
have been most commonly or most fruitfully employed in the recent history of neu- 
rolinguistic inquiry. Before enumerating these methods, it will be useful to consider 
the neurolinguist's answer to the first question: what is language? 
4-1. WHAT 
IS LANGUAGE? 
This misleadingly simple question has been a topic of debate for centuries. Neurolin- 
guists today content themselves with a functional working definition of language, that 
is, with a definition given in terms of how language is processed by normal human 
beings. Such a definition completely ignores some important aspects of language, 
including its cultural and social aspects. By concentrating mainly on the study of 
sublexical and lexical access, current functionalist definitions of language also tend to 
greatly downplay (though they certainly do not totally ignore) the importance of even 
such defining aspects of language use as grammatical syntax and semantic reference. 
Although the fine details and precise organization of a complete functional linguistic 
system are still unknown, there is a broad consensus within the field of neurolinguistics 
regarding its general outlines. Almost all researchers who use a functionalist defi- 
nition of language would agree that the outline will look something like the hier- 
archical outline in Table 1 (for similar classification schemes, see Caplan, 1992; 
Howard & Franklin, 1988; Patterson, 1986; Roeltgen & Rapcsak, 1993; Shallice, 
1988). 
At the top level of the classification, there is a distinction between the two main 
language modalities: spoken and written language. Within each of the modalities, 
language breaks down roughly into input and output functions, although this distinc- 
tion is more complex than it might appear at first pass. The input and output classes 
may each be broken down into two subhierarchies. Both classes include one subhier- 
archy linking that modality to semantics. The second subhierarchy consists of a set 
of components that function to access the elements of language defined by a hierar- 
chical deconstruction of the input and output streams relevant to that modality, into 
sentences, words, and letters in the written modality, and into sentences, words, and 
phonemes in the auditory modality. Both of these subhierarchies may themselves be 
further decomposed, as outlined in sections A and B of Table 1. Note that some of 
the components (marked with a black dot) serve a special role, which is translating 
between input and output, or between the written and oral modalities. 
This hierarchically structured definition of language does not capture all aspects of 
language that are of interest to the neurolinguist. Special consideration of some par- 
ticular word types is required to deal with categories of words for which there is some 
evidence of bimodal special treatment, including (but not limited to) affixed words 
(Miceli & Caramazza, 1988), abstract words (Breedin, Saffran, & Coslett, 1994), low- 
frequency words (Monsell, Doyle, & Haggard, 1989; Seidenberg, Waters, Barnes, & 
Tanenhaus, 1984), and, more controversially, words from particular semantic catego- 
ries (Warrington & Shallice, 1984). Neither the functional status nor the correct 
placement within the functional hierarchy of the resources devoted to processing these

word types is yet clear. It may be speculated that the observed dissociations in pro- 
cessing these word types are due to quantitative rather than qualititative disparities of 
the representation. This speculation finds some support from Warrington and Shallice's 
(1984) hypothesis that the distinction between biological and nonbiological kinds is 
dependent on the degree to which each class relies on functional versus perceptual 
representations. 
4-2. ORIGINS OF THE NEUROLINGUISTIC MODEL 
The functional definition of language, as outlined in Table 1, has evolved from a 
research program that arose in response to the failure and subsequent rejection of the 
aphasic taxonomic systems developed in the nineteenth century. Although the details 
behind the hotly debated rejection of those classification systems need not concern us 
here, that failure had three related results that are of direct relevance in understanding 
modern neurolinguistic research methodology. The first result was that neurolingistics 
was forced to return to "first principles," redefining itself (beginning in the late 1970s) 
with a research program that focused on developing an abstract and detailed descrip- 
tion of the way language breaks down as a result of neurological injury or degener- 
ation. The second result was that the study and classification of language deficits in 
and of themselves fell out of favor. Research efforts began to focus increasingly on 
relating the language behaviors observed following neurological injury to the normally 
functioning language system (see Marshall, 1986). This shift of focus was extremely 
fruitful methodologically, as researchers studying language began to borrow and adapt 
methods from other subfields of experimental psychology. They were aided in this 
task by the third result of the rejection of nineteenth-century classification systems: 
the rise of computational theories of psychological function, influenced by the wide- 
spread adoption in psychology of the information-processing paradigm as a meta- 
theory for psychological theorizing (see Gardner, 1985). The rise of computational 
theories has a great many implications that have impacted on the evolution of the 
field's methodology (Ellis & Young, 1988; Morton & Jusczyk, 1984; Parisi, 1985; 
Shallice, 1988). By far the most important of these is the assumption of modularity, 
which states that large computations should be implemented in small subparts that are 
as independent as possible within the constraints imposed by the function being com- 
puted. The bulk of neurolinguistic research may be aptly characterized as an attempt 
to confirm and clarify the assumption of modularity, most importantly by cataloging 
in precise terms what the smallest nondecomposable functional modules of the lan- 
guage system are. 
These three results define three intertwined goals of current neurolinguistic re- 
search: 
1. to map out the space of all possible linguistic deficits; 
2. to buttress and extend the explanatory implications of that research with 
evidence from normal human subjects; 

4 
Methods in Neurolinguistics 
87 
3. to unite the findings obtained from studying normal and brain-damaged 
subjects with a neurologically plausible model of how language is processed 
in the brain. 
In the remainder of this chapter, we will consider the methods employed in the 
pursuit of each of these three goals. 
4-3. METHODS 
4-3.1. Mapping Out the Neurolinguistic Deficit Space 
The mapping of neurolinguistic deficit space does not have any necessary priority 
over the other two goals of neurolinguistics. A model of neurolinguistic functioning 
or an experiment on normal subjects may reveal something important about the way 
that language must be instantiated, making a prediction about the way the actual 
language system must fail as a result. For example, the discovery of separate paths 
for processing real words and nonsense words was due largely to results from exper- 
iments with normal subjects. However, in practice the documentation of linguistic 
deficits in a clinical population has almost always served to generate the basic sci- 
entific facts of neurolinguistics. In this section we will consider four important classes 
of methods that are in widespread use: direct measures, reaction time measures, meas- 
ures of stimulus discrimination/confusability, and measures of priming and interfer- 
ence. Before we consider these four types of clinical research methods, we should 
note in passing that there exists a major methodological debate among neurolinguistic 
researchers who study patient populations: the debate over the status of group studies 
(in which data from patients deemed to have the same syndrome is averaged together) 
versus single-case studies (in which individual patients are described in detail, often 
without bothering to classify their "syndrome"). Although this complex and subtle 
issue is of considerable importance in understanding current neurolinguistic method- 
ology, we will not address it here (see Willmes, this volume). 
4-3.1.1. Direct Measures 
It might seem that the documentation of neurolinguistic deficits should be as straight- 
forward as simply asking a patient to perform a linguistic task and then recording 
whether or not he or she can do it. There would appear to be little room for debate 
about whether or not such a measure might be a good one, since (unlike many other 
measures in psychology) the relation of the measure to the function being measured 
is not open to dispute. However, in practice, testing a language function is never as 
simple as merely asking a patient to perform a language task and scoring his or her 
performance. There may be any number of explanations for a patient's low score on 
a particular task, since it is impossible to find words that have exactly one feature or 
tests that test precisely one function. As a result, no single language test can be 
definitive. A great deal of research effort in the field has been (and is still being) 

88 
Chris Westbury 
devoted to defining the optimal battery of mutually controlling tests of language func- 
tion. A neurolinguist working in English has a choice of a multitude of aphasia bat- 
teries. (For information on language tests and batteries in current usage, see Spreen 
& Strauss, 1991; Lezak, 1995; and Neils-Strunjag, this volume). 
Because no test battery can ever be absolutely conclusive or exhaustive, directly 
documenting the linguistic deficits of a single patient is a necessarily complex and 
time-consuming task. Although the precise methodological details of the documenta- 
tion process will vary from case to case, the process will inevitably involve duplication 
of measurement, and carefully controlled elimination of confounding variables, such 
as the effect of word type or modality. Often, this time-consuming but preliminary 
analysis will be followed by the creation, normalization, and study of patient perform- 
ance on tasks specific to the individual patient or set of patients under examination. 
As well as comparing performance to matched controls or to the subject's own per- 
formance on other tasks, many studies are devoted to the comparison of a subject's 
performance on language tasks to performance by other subjects who are of interest 
either because they come from a known diagnostic group, or a different language 
group, or (more controversially) because they have a known lesion site. Excellent 
examples of how to undertake a systematic detailed study of a linguistic deficit are 
given by Howard and Franklin (1988) and Caramazza and Hillis (1989b). It is mainly 
these kinds of painstakingly detailed descriptions of patient deficits which have con- 
tributed the raw data which has been used to construct models of language processing. 
When used carefully, with appropriate controls and with comprehensive coverage 
of the language system, direct measures allow for excellent description of deficits at 
a high level that is ecologically valid. In other words, they are useful for describing 
what aspects of the system may be damaged. However, they are of minimal use in 
explaining exactly how the language system is failing at a mechanistic level. They 
provide no insight at all into the actual process of language production or compre- 
hension, since by their very nature they can only report on the language system 
retrospectively, after processing is completed. The remaining methods we will consider 
in this section each have the advantage of being aimed at a lower level of analysis. 
4-3.1.2. Reaction Time Measures 
One lower-level measure that is used very often with patient populations in contem- 
porary neurolinguistics is reaction time, a precise measure of the time it takes for the 
patients to produce a response on a task. Reaction time is commonly used as an 
indirect measure of task difficulty, on the assumption that a task that requires more 
processing will take a longer time to complete. Differences in reaction time between 
normal and patient groups may shed light on both the role of specific brain areas and 
on the functional deficits associated with particular identified groups. Reaction time 
measures have been used to deduce deficits in such diverse functions and subject 
groups as lexical decision in closed head injury patients (Mtinte & Heinze, 1994), 
syntactic processing in an aged population (Obler, Fein, Nicholas, & Albert, 1991), 
and interhemispheric transfer time in reading-disabled children (Davidson, Leslie, & 
Saron, 1990).

Methods in Neurolinguistics

Reaction-time measures are more sensitive than direct measures, in the sense that 
reaction-time differences in processing different types of linguistic stimuli may be 
documented even when there are no differences in score. Documentation of such 
differences suggests that the different stimuli types must be represented and/or pro- 
cessed in different ways. In this way, reaction-time data have the great advantage of 
reflecting information about the true underlying representation of a stimulus, though 
they would of course be misleading in the unlikely case that two different processes 
coincidentally took the same time, at the level of measurable difference, to run their 
course. Technically, chronometric data can be difficult to gather (see Sergent, 1986), 
since the computers that are typically now used to gather such data are subject to 
technical limitations that can muddy the data, especially if those data depend on very 
subtle differences. Another complication is that many disease processes (as well as 
normal human aging) can impact on reaction time, confounding its use as a measure 
of language processing. 
4-3.1.3. Discrimination Measures 
One way around some of the limitations of reaction-time data is to gather chronometric 
information relevant to the timing of language functions without requiring a reaction 
from the subject, by asking subjects to make distinctions between stimuli that differ 
in subtle temporal characteristics. This technique has been used to show that some 
aphasic patients have disturbances in very low-level perceptual categories (Blumstein, 
Baker, & Goodglass, 1977) and to show that phonemic processing deficits may be 
related to lower-level auditory processing deficits (Aurbach, Allard, Naeser, Alexander, 
& Albert, 1982). 
Measures that rely on stimuli discrimination not only have the advantage over 
reaction times of allowing for the gathering of chronometric data that is independent 
of motor-reaction time, but also allow researchers to test for ability to make very fine, 
very low-level distinctions that might be difficult to test using other methods. Subtle 
differences in phonemes or click rates might not be apparent if one did not hear the 
stimuli in rapid succession. 
Asking a subject to differentiate between ambiguous or confusable stimuli can be 
informative for purposes other than testing fine chronometric distinctions. Since con- 
fusability rates can serve as a measure of similarity, confusion data have one major 
advantage over other types of data: if one can gather enough repeated measures, it is 
possible to process such data with multidimensional scaling packages in order to 
derive information about the abstract organization of the stimuli within the language 
system. Arguin, Bub, and Dudek's (1996) documentation of the relation between stim- 
uli complexity and semantic organization in a patient with category-specific anomia 
for fruits and vegetables was inspired by their analysis of which fruits and vegetables 
that patient confused with other fruits and vegetables. Methodologically analogous 
work has been done in studying rates of confusion of phonemes in aphasic patients 
(see Caplan, 1992, p. 53, for a review of this literature). One major weakness of such 
statistical representations of confusability data is that it is not possible to gain much 
information about the actual neuronal representations (as opposed to the abstract 

90 
Chris Westbury 
organization) of the confused stimuli. Representing data in a non-Euclidean multidi- 
mensional space does not tell us how or why the brain has instantiated that particular 
map, any more than our ability to describe planetary motion using calculus tells us 
how gravity works. 
4-3.1.4. Measures of Priming and Interference 
Another technique in widespread use is priming, in which exposure to one stimulus 
is used to facilitate or (in the case of negative priming) interfere with access to a 
second stimulus, which is related to the first one either lexically, syntactically, or 
semantically. The amount of facilitation or interference (often assessed by measuring 
differences in reaction time to the second stimulus) is used to glean information about 
the way the target words and the primed words are organized. Facilitative priming 
tasks have been used, for example, to document disruption in lexico-semantic access 
in quite different ways in patients with Huntington's disease (Smith, Butters, White, 
Lyon, & Granholm, 1988) and Alzheimer's disease (Chertkow, Bub, & Seidenberg, 
1989; Chertkow, et al., 1994). The paradigmatic example of a negative priming (in- 
terference) effect is that seen in the Stroop task. In that task, color names were shown 
to interfere with access to the color in which those names were printed, suggesting 
that the lexical and perceptual semantic systems do not function independently of each 
other. By comparing the extent of the interference between analogous tasks involving 
systematic interference, it is possible to deduce how tightly coupled two functions are, 
and how that coupling is affected by different neurological conditions. For example, 
Revonsuo (1995) studied an aphasic patient who was unable to match written color 
names to the corresponding color, and demonstrated that he nevertheless showed a 
normal Stroop effect, suggesting that there can be implicit processing of unrecognized 
words. Lackner and Shattuck-Hufnagel (1982) used another kind of interference task 
(immediate repetition of words presented at varying rates, called "shadowing") to 
demonstrate that penetrating wounds of the left cerebral hemisphere could leave long- 
term language deficits even if none were apparent in normal discourse. Many other 
variations on manipulating the difficulty of an interfering task are possible. An original 
use of the general method is exemplified by Arguin, Bub, and Dudek's (1996) exper- 
iment, in which they presented evidence showing that the increasing number of di- 
mensions of variation of a class of stimuli interfered with the ability of an agnosic 
patient to access semantic information about that class. 
Experiments that rely on priming or interference measurement can only give us 
information about the time course and the extent of interference between competing 
cognitive processes or representations of different stimuli. They cannot, in them- 
selves, tell us much about what those processes and representations are, how 
they function, or exactly why they prime or interfere with each other. There is cur- 
rently no clear understanding of exactly what it means, at a neuronal level, for one 
psychological process to facilitate or interfere with another. Interpretation of the func- 
tional significance of priming and interference effects must therefore be made with 
caution.

4-3.2. Obtaining Evidence from Normal Human Subjects 
Testing performance on language tests is of minimal use in studying language organ- 
ization in normals, since normal adults tend to show a ceiling effect on most of the 
subtests that are commonly used with patient populations. Research on normals thus 
depends largely on studying the effect of indirect measures that perturb the language 
system in some systematic way. Many of the measures discussed in the previous 
section are also commonly used in studying normal language organization. In many 
cases, information may be gleaned from using such measures to compare two different 
normal populations, such as unilingual speakers of languages that differ in theoreti- 
cally interesting ways (for example, Katz, Rexer, & Lukatela, 1991) or subjects from 
different age groups (for example, Gropen, Pinker, Hollander, & Goldberg, 1991). The 
number of experiments that have been conducted on normal language processing is 
far too vast to allow them to be described in any detail here. Reviews may be found 
in Foss (1988) and Gernsbacher (1994). 
4-3.2.1. Natural Errors 
One rich source of information about language processing in a normal population is 
the study of naturally produced errors and hesitations. As Meringer and Mayer put it 
over a century ago, by such study "the cover is lifted from the clockwork and we 
can look in on the cogs" (cited in Aitchison, 1987, p. 18). Much research on children's 
malapropisms suggests that such errors are produced in a rule-based fashion (for ex- 
ample, Gropen et al., 1991; see Aitchison & Straff, 1982 for an analysis of how adult 
errors differ). 
The study of natural language is important because it serves to constrain the set 
of possible models of language organization. Consistency in the kinds of errors shown 
by children and adults suggests that such errors may be revealing something of the 
fundamental architecture of language. Inconsistencies across development reveal 
something about how the language system evolves over a human life. The study of 
natural language errors is difficult and expensive, however, as the necessary data are 
rare and time-consuming to collect. 
4-3.2.2. Other Methods 
The difficulties inherent in studying language processing in normals have led to the 
recent development of a number of innovative measures for studying language pro- 
cessing. For example, advances in eye tracking have been used (e.g., Just & Carpenter, 
1993) to measure a multitude of new variables (including the likelihood that a subject 
has fixated on a word, the fixation duration, the number and kind of regressive eye 
movements, and the total time devoted to examining a word) and recent advances in 
electrical and magnetic recording devices allow for the measure of language event- 
related potentials (ERPs) (e.g., Nobre & McCarthy, 1994, 1995; Segalowitz & 
Chevalier, this volume) and evoked magnetic fields (EMFs) (see Papanicolaou, Simos, 

92 
Chris Westbury 
& Basile, this volume). With continuing advancements in technology, we can expect 
that the number of unusual dependent measures being evaluated for their relation to 
language processing will increase in the coming years. Much work will be necessary 
to determine what they may reveal about the principles underlying language organi- 
zation. 
4-3.3. Building Neurologically Plausible Models 
The last of the three goals of neurolinguistics under discussion is model generation. 
As they do in any science, models in neurolinguistics serve two main roles, both as 
mnemonic devices to represent complex data sets in ways that make those data sets 
humanly comprehensible, and as explanatory devices that relate data from one domain 
to a different domain that is either more general, better-understood, or more easily 
amenable to empirical study. The theoretical level at which neurolinguistic models are 
defined ranges widely, from very abstract, structured "top down" text-based models, 
to detailed dynamic "bottom up" computational simulations. 
The majority of models in neurolinguistics serve the first role, not so much adding 
new data to our understanding as helping to organize the data that underlie that un- 
derstanding. "Box and arrow" models have played a fundamental role in the recent 
history of neurolinguistics, mainly as mnemonic devices. A well-known example is 
Patterson's (1986) model of single-word access, which instantiates a great deal of 
information about the role that various abstract components have been inferred to play 
in word access, and how those components must be connected given the observed 
pattern of breakdowns in single-word access. However, the model makes no claims 
about how the individual functional components might work, or about how they might 
be instantiated in the brain, and makes no explicit predictions about new ways in 
which the language system might fail. 
At the opposite end of the modeling spectrummand increasingly important as a 
methodological tool in neurolinguistics--are the connectionist models, which use ar- 
tificial neural networks to simulate language behavior (see Besner, Twilley, McCann, 
& Seergobin, 1990; Harris & Small, this volume; Harley, 1993; Reilly & Sharkey, 
1992; Seidenberg, 1993, 1994 for overviews). Connectionist models have been used 
to model a diverse set of language phenomena, including the Stroop effect (Cohen, 
Dunbar, & McClelland, 1990), category-specific agnosia (Farah & McClelland, 1992), 
and naming errors in optic aphasia (Plaut & Shallice, 1993). 
Many published models fall somewhere in the range between fine-grained dynamic 
connectionist models and high-level static models. For example, Friederci (1995) pro- 
poses a static theoretical model of syntactic activation that is constrained by experi- 
mentally gathered neurophysiological timing evidence. There is no current consensus 
in the field about which kind of models are most appropriate given the current state 
of knowledge (see Gupta & Touretzky, 1994; Besner et al., 1990 for dissenting view- 
points on this issue). 
Models may be a mixed blessing in neurolinguistics. It is possible to build com- 
putational and conceptual models that can accurately reproduce phenomena without 

4 
Methods in Neurolinguistics 
93 
being sure that the models have captured anything essential about the way those 
phenomena are produced naturally: Compare Farah and McClelland's (1988) model 
of category-specific agnosia to the very different explanation of that phenomenon 
offered on the basis of experimental evidence by Arguin, Bub, and Dudek (1996). So 
litttle is known about the underlying representation of language in the brain that it is 
often very difficult to assess the validity of assumptions and parameter settings in 
models of neurolinguistic phenomena. Nevertheless, modeling serves an important role 
by producing "existence proofs" of how language might be represented. Such models 
serve as hypotheses that can guide experimental research directed at testing the im- 
plicit or explicit assumptions that went into a successful model. 
4-4. CONCLUSION 
The literature on psychological approaches to neurolinguistics is now so large that a 
thorough review is no longer possible. The cursory overview provided in this chapter 
may help to convince the reader that the fundamental methods serve one of three main 
purposes. The most important purpose at the current stage of knowledge--the sine 
qua non of all neurolinguistic research--is to exhaustively list and classify the fun- 
damental components of the human language system. Progress is being made toward 
this end mainly by a carefully controlled documentation of ways in which the language 
system can fail. As neurolinguists gain increasingly fine-grained knowledge of the 
fundamental units of the language system, we can achieve our second purpose, which 
is to study how those units act and interact in the normally functioning human being. 
This is achieved mainly by perturbing the normal system in various ways, while 
measuring the effect of such perturbation on the fundamental linguistic functions that 
have been previously identified. Finally, as we understand more about the language 
system, we attempt to consolidate, extend, and demonstrate our understanding by 
constructing models that summarize our knowledge in a compact way, or in a way 
that reproduces observed real-world linguistic phenomena. Although the methods of 
neurolinguistics will certainly be extended and refined in the coming years, these three 
fundamental goals will surely continue to guide the field.

Techniques and Applications to Lexical Access

Department of Psychology, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada L2S 3A1 
The past decade or so has seen a very large increase in the use of event-related 
potential (ERP) techniques to study the brain's responses to the processing of 
linguistic information. In this chapter, we discuss some of the strengths and weak- 
nesses of ERP techniques in neurolinguistic research and the ways they have 
been applied to brain theory. We also review specific ERP paradigms addressing 
questions of lexical access, word-class distinctions (open versus closed class and 
noun versus verb), and phonological access. 
During the 1970s and 1980s, event-related potential (ERP) techniques were greatly 
expanded to include investigations beyond primary sensory coding and simple atten- 
tion. Coupling this with developments in the microcomputer and electronics fields that 
dramatically reduced the costs of an ERP laboratory, many new investigators from a 
variety of fields joined with electrophysiologists to broaden the field. Over the past 
decade or so, there has been an enormous growth in ERP studies of psycholinguistic

issues alone. A summary from the PsychLit abstracts of all papers published from 
1986 to 1995 for the key words "language" and "ERPs" (and their synonyms) pro- 
duces more than 350 journal articles and 45 book chapters. Many of these make use 
of language-related ERPs to study other phenomena, such as memory or psycho- 
pathology, or the characteristics of ERPs themselves. Still, there are far too many to 
provide an exhaustive review of the literature. Our purpose here is to outline the ERP 
paradigm and the kinds of neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic questions being ad- 
dressed in scalp-recorded ERP paradigms with a focus on research since 1990, and 
some of their strengths, weaknesses, and possible future directions. In this chapter, we 
will also describe work on lexical and phonological access. In the next chapter, we 
will give a review of ERP studies of semantics, syntax, reading, developmental, and 
second language issues. More detailed reviews of specific research questions and 
methodological issues can be found elsewhere (Garnsey, 1993; Hagoort & Kutas, 
1995; Halgren, 1990; Osterhout & Holcomb, 1995; Kutas & Van Petten, 1988, 1994; 
Metz-Lutz, 1995; Pulvermtiller, 1996). 
5-1. OVERVIEW 
OF THE ERP PARADIGM 
5-1.1. The EEG Signal and the Theory of Averaging 
The EEG records the fluctuating voltage changes at various scalp sites with respect 
to some common reference location, often the earlobes or an average of all the scalp 
sites. The scalp voltage reflects primarily synaptic activity on the dendrites of cortical 
pyramidal cells because pyramidal cells align their dendrites vertically and this allows 
the voltage potential to summate (Martin, 1991). Because of this parallel arrangement 
of pyramidal dendrites, the scalp potential may reflect the activity of these connections 
in their cortical columns (Picton, Lins, & Sherg, 1995). Thus, EEG does not reflect 
presynaptic activity (that is, axon potentials), nor much of the activity of nonpyramidal 
neurons whose dendrites are not aligned. Therefore, we should not think of the EEG 
as a full reflection of the brain's processing of information. In this way, the EEG does 
not reflect the same activity as do metabolically related brain-imaging systems such 
as PET, SPECT, or fMRI. 
When EEG is recorded to a series of events, we refer to these EEG segments as 
event-related potentials. Normally, we group such ERPs to many similar events into 
an overall average for each subject. In this chapter, we will use the term "ERP" to 
refer to these averaged waveforms. Averaging the EEG across many events reduces 
the effect of the nonevent-related EEG, that is, it averages out other ongoing activa- 
tion, so that the waveform that remains is more likely to reflect the effects of the 
particular information processing induced by the stimulus event. An example of a 
standard ERP waveform is given in Figure 1, where the stimulus was a series of easily 
identified high-pitch tones. The ERP is characterized by a series of positive and neg- 
ative components (or peaks) that we have learned, after many years of study, reflect 
somewhat specific aspects of information processing, the earlier ones more likely to 

5 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part I 
97 
reflect the automatic aspects of processing the stimulus and the later ones more likely 
to reflect processing contingent on the subject's cognitive strategy (for overviews, see 
Polich 1993, and Picton & Hillyard, 1988). Each component often actually reflects a 
number of subcomponents that can only be teased apart by careful experimental de- 
signs and by examination of the pattern of ERPs across the scalp. This pattern across 
the scalp is referred to as the scalp topography, and it is sometimes crucial for deter- 
mining the interpretation of the ERP components. Thus, it is very important to know 
the testing paradigm that the ERP comes from to fully evaluate the result. Just as it 
is important to know the physical challenge on the body to evaluate cardiovascular 
data, we must know the cognitive challenge to evaluate the neuroelectric result. (A 
note on terminology: Negative and positive peaks are designated N and P followed 
by a number. Single digits refer to the sequence of first, second, etc., peaks and do 
not reflect the timing, for example, P1, N1, P2, N2, P3, while others indicate the 
timing in milliseconds from the onset of the stimulus, for example, N280, P600. 
Sometimes the initial specification of timing has been recently dropped in favor of a 
sequence number because a component has become well accepted, and so a peak can 
have two labels, for example, P3 and P300, N4 and N400.)

5-1.2. Benefits and Limits of Using ERPs in Linguistic 
and Neurolinguistic Research 
There are a variety of benefits of ERP technology over standard behavioral methods 
in investigating psycholinguistic phenomena with respect to brain structures and func- 
tions. First of all, it is one of the few noninvasive ways, and certainly the least 
expensive, of getting fairly detailed measures of brain activity as they relate to infor- 
mation processing, whether in normals or with those with some brain disturbance 
(Gevins, Leong, Smith, Le, & Du, 1995). In addition, ERPs allow examination of 
online processing with respect to a mental chronometry, so that with ERPs we are in 
a position to make some (often cautious) statements about the timing of various cog- 
nitive processes (Jennings & Coles, 1991). ERPs also permit measurement of online 
brain activity in contexts where behavioral output is problematic, for example, with 
respect to speech or language parsing with aphasic patients and with infants. Whereas 
other brain-imaging techniques (such as PET and fMRI) are more suitable for local- 
izing activity in the brain, ERP technology provides more flexibility in terms of stim- 
ulus presentation and more resolution in the time domain. In addition, there have been 
dramatic improvements in methods for spatial localization using ERPs (Gevins et al., 
1995; Tucker, Liotti, Potts, Russell, & Posner, 1994), that is, for determining the 
physiological sources of ERP components. 
ERPs also have inherent limitations, which are circumvented only with a good deal 
of ingenuity and organization. First of all, we must remember that ERPs are responses 
to time-locked stimulus presentations, with millisecond accuracy, and they are not 
appropriate for circumstances where a longer-term mental state is of interest, such as 
over minutes. Several methods have been developed to bypass this limitation, however, 
by using electrophysiological methods that are indirect with respect to the stimuli. 
One such technique involves ERP probes, which are averaged waveforms that are 
time-locked to some unobtrusive set of events, such as tones or light flashes, which 
do not require a response from the subject, who is engaged in some cognitive task of 
interest such as identifying phoneme sequences in one condition and emotional tone 
of voice in another condition (for example, Papanicolaou & Johnstone, 1984). By 
examining the pattern of how the ongoing probe ERPs alter as a function of the 
experimental condition, for example, listening for phonemes or emotions, one can 
draw conclusions about which scalp sites seem sensitive to the distinction (and there- 
fore presumably which brain areas are involved). Another such technique is spectral 
analysis, which breaks down the ongoing EEG signal into frequencies from very slow 
to very fast (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves). Again, by examining the 
pattern of changes associated with the experimental conditions, one can draw conclu- 
sions about the relative sensitivity of various sites to the experimental manipulation 
(Pulvermt~ller, 1996). These alternative methods, however, lose much of the richness 
of the standard ERP paradigm because they do not provide a mental chronometry of 
the stimulus-processing event. 
Another practical limitation in the collection of ERP data is the requirement of 
having the subject suppress motor actions that mask the cognitive ERE especially eye

movements. Various techniques have been used (Picton et al., 1995), the most common 
of which is for the subject to withhold blinks and responses until after the stimulus 
is presented. The only limitations here are that normal behavior is restricted, and of 
course this may not be possible with all subjects, for example, those with neurological 
disorders that produce uncontrollable movements, and sometimes with children. Al- 
though these limitations in the ERP techniques are surmountable with effort, com- 
parisons across laboratories are sometimes difficult because of different choices of 
how to deal with the problems. 
There are other limitations that we should be aware of. The ERP is not an absolute 
reflection of the brain's electrical activity but is a reflection as seen through the par- 
ticular data-collection equipment. The particular montage of electrode sites influences 
the pattern of ERP components seen in the signal. Similarly, the choice of reference 
site influences the ERP morphology. Also, the characteristics of the amplifiers deter- 
mine the limitations of the signals recorded: The frequency cutoff, determined at the 
low end by the time constant of the amplifiers, affects the degree to which the system 
is sensitive to the slow wave components of the ERE For example, slow-wave activity 
is attenuated unless the amplifiers allow very low frequencies to pass through. Cutoffs 
at the upper end smooth the signal, making the ERP easier to score and less "noisy," 
but also delay somewhat the peak latencies of the major slow components, such as 
the P300, and can completely mask components of short duration. Although these 
amplifier parameters are usually held constant within laboratories, they often differ 
across laboratories and thus we acknowledge that there will be differences in research 
results between research groups for reasons that are not related to experimental factors. 
In addition, different researchers have preferences for different analysis techniques, 
the two prominent ones being a search for particular well-studied components, such 
as the P300 or N400, versus the search for whatever segments of the data differentiate 
the independent variables of the study. The latter can be done by careful visual com- 
parison of the critical experimental with appropriate control conditions (with subse- 
quent statistical follow-up), or by the Principal Components Analysis-Analysis of Var- 
iance (PCA-ANOVA) or similar technique that searches for components that account 
for major portions of the variance in the ERP and then relates these to the independent 
variables. There are pros and cons to each approach, and we must at least be aware 
of data analysis as a potential source of variation across studies (Segalowitz & Berge, 
1995). 
5-2. RELATIONS 
BETWEEN 
ERPS 
AND LANGUAGE 
BEHAVIOR 
An overview of this literature leads us to recognize two uses of ERPs in neurolin- 
guistic research. First, ERPs can be used as a dependent variable to test hypotheses 
about language processing, language distinctions, and language development or ac- 
quisition, just as behavioral psycholinguists might use word knowledge, lexical access 
response times, and sentence production. In such a case, electrophysiological theory 

100 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H~l~ne Chevalier 
is less important than it might otherwise be since no serious conclusions of a physi- 
ological sort are being made. This is not the case with the second use, where ERPs 
can be used as a tool to examine brain localization of function. In this situation, we 
must assume that the researcher has a phenomenon well established and only wishes 
to ask the question, "Can we find dissociable brain sites for this distinction?" In such 
a case, we must have at least an implicit model of language in the brain. 
5-2.1. Organization of Language in the Brain 
A large number of psycholinguistic questions that have occupied behavioral research- 
ers have now become amenable to ERP testing. Such questions include basic issues 
of linguistic analyses: (a) the psychological reality of the noun versus verb distinction; 
(b) the content versus function word distinction; (c) divisions between syntax and 
semantics; and (d) specific questions of grammar theory. Others involve psycholin- 
guistic issues of language acquisition: (e) comparability of the linguistic competence 
of first and second languages (L1 and L2) in bilinguals; (f) how to assess linguistic 
competence without behavioral production (for example, in infants and nonspeaking 
children); and (g) longitudinal relationships between very early speech processing and 
later language acquisition. There are also a large number of specific questions, such 
as the relationship between word reading and phonological access, and acoustic versus 
phonological coding. We will address the first two issues in this chapter as they serve 
to introduce the paradigm. The others we will cover in the next chapter. 
5-2.2. Organization of Language in the Brain 
Neurolinguistic theory has traditionally seen language as represented in the brain in 
two main centers: an anterior one that deals with word output, phonological planning, 
and basic syntactic constructions, and a posterior one that deals with lexical access, 
word meaning, and the linking of lexical semantics to world knowledge. These divi- 
sions come, of course, from clinical aphasia research, with assumed extrapolation to 
subjects with normal language and intact brains. ERP studies have allowed us to bridge 
this gap to some extent by testing brain localization hypotheses in normals. Many of 
the issues outlined in the previous section have also been addressed with respect to 
brain localization (when adequate electrode placement has permitted). In addition, 
there are specific research questions that are amenable to ERP testing, such as the 
locus of language representation in aphasics who have recovered some linguistic abil- 
ity (for example Papanicolaou, DiScenna, Gillespie, & Aram, 1990; Papanicolaou, 
Moore, Deutsch, Levin, & Eisenberg, 1988), but we will not cover them here. 
5-2.3. A General Model of Brain-Language Relationships 
Pulvermtiller (1996) outlines a general approach that is flexible enough to deal with 
the various models currently available. He takes as his starting point the now well- 

5 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part I 
101 
accepted notion proposed by Hebb in 1949, namely, that psychological constructs have 
as their counterpart in the brain neural networks that form assemblies of cells that can 
be quite far-ranging in terms of tissue distance. To the extent that psycholinguistic 
distinctions are manifested in cell assembly distinctions, then we should be able to 
find distinctive firing patterns. It need not be the case, of course, that the firing patterns 
will be distinctive enough for ERP techniques to distinguish them, but it is always 
possible that they might be so. Given this possibility, we can ask empirically whether 
such distinctive patterns can be found for specific questions. 
5-3. SOME 
LEXICAL 
SEMANTIC 
ISSUES 
Lexical semantics involves the coding of word meanings (Caplan, 1987). We take this 
to include semantic features (for example, + animate, + object, - action) that also 
have implications for grammatical use. Thus, lexical semantics includes the specifi- 
cations of the word that promote the use of the word as a noun versus a verb (with 
crossing over being more likely in some cases than in others, and being subject to 
further morphological rules). Because of this, it may be difficult to separate neurolin- 
guistically the grammatical from semantic specifications. 
The noun/verb distinction is primary to much of linguistic theory and clearly is a 
suitable distinction in the context of sentence processing. Given this, one might expect 
that such a distinction would be respected in terms of how the brain codes lexical 
items or processes them, that is, whether they depend on different tissue in the brain. 
Daniele, Giustolisi, Silveri, Colosimo, and Gainotti (1994) present cases of left frontal 
damage leading to impairments of verb processing and left temporal damage leading 
to impairment of noun processing. Hillis and Caramazza (1995) argue that noun and 
verb dissociation is further embedded within input and output systems. Such a 
noun/verb dissociation has also been demonstrated with ERPs in normals performing 
lexical decisions (deciding whether a stimulus string of letters is a legitimate word 
in the language), with verbs showing significantly greater positivity around 200 to 
230 msec after word presentation at anterior electrode sites (Preissl, Pulvermtiller, 
Lutzenberger, & Birbaumer, 1995) and nouns showing a significantly greater effect at 
occipital sites (in a reanalysis of the data presented in Pulvermtiller, 1996). This con- 
trast is attributed to the semantic associations of the words used in the study-- 
the nouns were chosen to be more concrete and imagistic, verbs more motor- 
associated--but, as mentioned earlier, it may be impossible to really separate semantic 
and grammatical features. Interestingly, there were no hemispheric effects, suggesting 
that areas outside the classical language areas contribute to the lexical semantics in 
the wider "world-knowledge" sense. (It is not yet clear what implications this has for 
the concept of lexical semantics in the narrow linguistic sense.) Similarly, Samar and 
Berent (1986) found that an ERP component centering on 220 msec poststimulus 
distinguishes nouns from verbs, again with verbs obtaining greater positivity. In this 
case, there were no interactions with site, and analyses at separate sites were not 
presented. 

102 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H~l~ne Chevalier 
Preissl et al.'s (1995) use of nouns and verbs confounds semantic space with word 
class, since only verbs denoting motion and nouns denoting concrete objects were 
used. From a linguistic viewpoint, nouns and verbs are not defined this way; "de- 
mocracy" is just as much a noun as is "table," and "to think" is just as much a verb 
as is "to push." Defined in this way, the presumed cell assemblies reflect the deno- 
tative subsets as much as grammatical class. Perhaps a further way to examine gram- 
matical class per se would be to look at ERP patterns resulting from noun/verb ho- 
mographs, easy in English (rebel, love, hate, hope, house, etc.), controlling of course 
for word frequency and imagery value, or with a systematic inclusion of abstract nouns 
and verbs. 
Lexical distinctions can be made within word class too. For example, Wetzel and 
Molfese (1992) recorded ERPs to two factive verbs (noticed, revealed) and two non- 
factive verbs (maintained, supposed) embedded within appropriate sentence frames; 
for example, "Dick noticed Bob was gone," about which the subject answered a 
question. Bilateral frontal and left temporal sites distinguished verb type late around 
1100 msec, but there was also a distinction at central-parietal sites bilaterally at 140 
msec. Although the latter seems early enough as a marker of syntactic processing, the 
former is perhaps more a reflection of memory and processing requirements resulting 
from the verb being factive versus nonfactive. 
Lexical semantics also involves semantic features, such as word concreteness. This 
has been explored with a view to testing the notion that abstract words make use 
primarily of neural assemblies in the left hemisphere while concrete words make use 
of bilateral representation. Kounios and Holcomb (1994) showed that concrete items 
are associated with more negativity at 300-500 and 500-800 msec than abstract items 
(with the two time frames providing separate components). In both time ranges, ERPs 
to concrete and abstract words were different over the right hemisphere sites but were 
not different at left hemisphere sites, consistent with dual-coding theory, with the 
effect being more anterior at the 300-500 msec period and more evenly distributed at 
500-800 msec. Pulvermtiller (1996) has applied EEG spectral techniques to these same 
issues with much success. 
5-4. THE 
CONTENT 
VERSUS 
FUNCTION 
WORD 
DISTINCTION 
Most of the studies on the noun/verb distinction described so far present stimulus 
words singly for lexical decision, except for Samar and Berent (1986), who presented 
words in short phrases. Researchers have not suggested that the ERP results would 
change dramatically if the stimulus words were presented in sentence frames, although 
this is conceivable for reasons discussed later, namely, that online lexical-frame pro- 
cessing need not tap the same neurological processes as lexical lookup. 
The same difficulty may hold for the major word class distinction of open-class 
(OC) versus closed-class (CC) words. Open-class (or content) words are composed of 

5 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part I 
103 
nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and technically they also contain adverbs. Closed-class 
items (or function words) are the limited set representing pronouns, relative pronouns, 
articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and, technically speaking, auxiliary verbs, but in 
isolation it is sometimes hard to distinguish some auxiliaries from verbs and so they 
are usually omitted in experiments. Similarly, one may want to exclude prepositions 
because they have more "content," although they also have lower frequency counts 
and therefore are better matches to open-class words on this dimension. 
Despite the dissociation of CC from OC words in aphasia subtypes (Caplan, 1987) 
and on reading speed measures (Chiarello & Nuding, 1987), it has been suggested 
that CC are simply a special subset of OC words that have high frequency, low 
imageability, short length, and low stress (see Neville, Mills, & Lawson, 1992 for a 
discussion and references). On the other hand, finding qualitatively different patterns 
of ERPs to the different classes, if we could control for frequency, word length, 
semantics, and so forth, would justify the division on the basis of the grammar. Doing 
so would be extremely difficult, of course. 
Neville et al. (1992) presented sentences for sensibility judgments, that is, deter- 
mining whether or not the final word was semantically appropriate. ERPs were taken 
to every word except the first and last in each sentence and averaged to form an OC 
average (nouns, verbs, adjectives, n = 446) and a CC average (articles, prepositions, 
conjunctions, etc., n = 391). What they found accords well with expectations from 
the aphasic literature. OC and CC words were differentiated significantly by 150 msec 
in the ERPs at the frontal sites and slightly later at posterior sites at 170 msec. CC 
words produced a significantly greater negative peak over frontal cortex, while the 
OC words produced the larger negative peak posteriorly. This early distinction was 
greater over the left hemisphere. In addition, there is a clear distinction between the 
latency of OC and CC negative peaks during the 235-400 msec window: The nega- 
tivity associated with CC words comes earlier (N280) and with OC words later 
(N350), clearest over temporal and anterior temporal sites (see Figure 2). The ampli- 
tude of the CC N280 was greatest over frontal and anterior temporal sites of the left 
hemisphere, while the OC N350 amplitude was largest over posterior sites of both 
hemispheres, and in fact tended to be larger at the right hemisphere sites. The late 
positive component (LPC) between 300 and 600 msec peaked 50-100 msec earlier for 
CC than OC words, and this effect was significant only at the left hemisphere sites. 
LPC amplitude and later negativities (N400-700) also differentiated CC and OC words 
with electrode site interactions. 
Because it is important to consider the confounding of word class with frequency 
of occurrence in the language (CC being more frequent), Neville et al. (1992) also 
checked high- and low-frequency words within word class, and found that the N 170 
and N350 were both sensitive to frequency (less frequent words elicited greater neg- 
ativities over posterior regions). Over anterior regions, word frequency did not affect 
the ERP parameters, but of course CC words are on the whole more frequent than 
OC words so it may be impossible to rule out a frequency range factor affecting peak 
latency, amplitude, and topography. Word length also affected ERP results but not in 
a way that would suggest that the word-class effect is really a word-length effect.

5-4.1. Is the Anterior-Posterior Distinction for OC and CC Words 
Due to Lexical Access or Sentence Context? 
Neville et al.'s (1992) results from normals are consistent with the notion stemming 
from the aphasia literature that grammatical dysfunction is associated with left hem- 
isphere anterior damage, and that OC and CC words serve different functions and are 
dependent on different storage and linguistic factors. They are also compatible with 
the faster, more automatic access people have to CC words. However, by averaging 
across all trials, some individual words are more represented than others in the av- 
eraged ERE This would be especially so among CC items where we would expect 
the and a to appear more often than any other item. In addition, the subjects presum- 
ably could anticipate the word type that is about to occur. Therefore, what was being 
averaged was OC and CC word frames as well as words themselves. If the results 
really reflect such word frames, then they support the grammar/semantics distinction, 
since such grammatical frames seem to be associated with frontal and lateralized 
negativities, whereas semantic access is related to a later bilateral posterior negativity, 
the N400. 
This "word-frame" interpretation of the results is mitigated by other studies dem- 
onstrating somewhat similar effects in lexical decision tasks, where the words can be 
balanced for presentation frequency and are randomized so as to preclude word-class 
anticipation. Pulvermtiller, Lutzenberger, and Birbaumer (1995) found that the ERP 
differentiated OC and CC words by 160 msec poststimulus onset and that CC words 
produced a hemisphere interaction but OC words did not. There are some differences, 
however, from the Neville et al. (1992) study. The timing of the components and their 
morphology were different, with Pulvermtiller et al. (1995; see their Figure 3) not 
finding N280 and N350 components distinguishing CC and OC words in the same 
way. In contrast to Pulvermtiller's results, Nobre and McCarthy (1994) also examined 
ERPs to CC and OC words in isolation in a task where subjects were reading for 
meaning (instead of lexical decision), and they do report an anterior negativity (N288) 
with the CC items and an N410 posteriorly with OC items. Similarly, the ERPs to 
function words reported by Kluender and Kutas (1993b) also show a negative peak 
at the more anterior sites at around 300 msec that disappears posteriorly, and is 
stronger at the left sites. Their anterior negativity (which was not the subject of their 
investigation or statistical analyses) was different from subsequent N400 responses, 
which were primarily posterior and stronger at right hemisphere sites. This earlier 
anterior negativity was absent for sentence-final content words. Thus there is consid- 
erable circumstantial evidence to support Neville et al.'s (1992) findings of ERP mark- 
ers for OC and CC, but not necessarily when people are making lexical decisions. 
Although it is true that the processing demands of word frames and frequency of 
occurrence may account for these ERP markers, this does not mitigate their existence 
in normal language processing, but may rather explain the basis for finding them. 
Further studies will be needed to determine whether this ERP distribution is the 
same in single-word presentations as in sentence presentations. In a way, we should 

106 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H~l~ne Chevalier 
not expect identical results, since words presented in sentence context have anticipa- 
tion working where lexical decision tasks do not. But the anterior/posterior differences 
in the studies that require reading for meaning do suggest that the anterior/posterior 
effect is attributable to the full lexical lookup in contrast to lexical decisions, which 
may not fully require full lexical access (that is, to both full phonological and semantic 
representations). Another logical alternative, although one for which we have no em- 
pirical support, is that lexical decision requires much more than lexical lookup and 
this additional processing masks important ERP components. 
This issue of the comparability of processing words in isolation versus in sentence 
contexts is a major one (Kutas, 1993). Van Petten (1995; Van Petten & Kutas, 1990, 
1991) showed that ERP differences related to the frequency effects (larger N400 am- 
plitudes to low-frequency items) are lost when meaningful sentences provide contex- 
tual constraints. The same data set shows no indication of a frontal N280 for CC 
words, although there does appear to be a posterior N350 for OC words and also 
some late frontal (400-800 msec) sensitivity to context for CC words but not for OC 
words. Again, this is suggestive of a CC-frontal connection and an OC-posterior con- 
nection, although they seem highly sensitive to test conditions. In real sentence con- 
texts, semantic features, grammatical expectations, and word-frequency effects are 
closely linked. These studies demonstrate the rich dynamics of word processing. 
5-5. STUDIES ON PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSING 
USING ERPS 
There are fewer studies of phonological processing using ERPs than of semantic or 
syntactic processing, which is probably due partly to the particular linguistic interests 
of the ERP researchers (psycholinguistics has a longer history in semantic and syn- 
tactic issues) and partly to technical requirements of the presentation of speech stimuli 
compared to visually presented words. However, there are a variety of questions con- 
cerning phonological processing that are amenable to ERP methodology. Because of 
space limitations, we will present some of them only briefly, with the implications 
being, we hope, self-evident. Praamstra and Stegeman (1993) showed that the N400, 
a component usually associated with semantics, can reflect the phonological level of 
processing: subjects produced an N400 on rhyming mismatch trials, whether the spo- 
ken stimuli were real words or nonwords (eliminating lexical access as a necessary 
component) and when the items to be matched were spoken by different voices (elim- 
inating the physical-acoustic factor), and in lexical decisions with real words but not 
in lexical decisions with nonwords (suggesting that lexical access prompts phonolog- 
ical access). Further, Praamstra, Meyer, and Levelt (1994) found that ERP data were 
more 
sensitive to phonological priming than were behavioral measures. Using visual 
presentations, Vald6s-Sosa, Gonzalez, Xiang, Yi, and Bobes (1993) reported N400 
effects for rhyming versus nonrhyming primes in Chinese, where the logographs do 

5 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part I 
107 
not directly code the sounds at all. This would support the position that word read- 
ing would certainly activate phonological representation in languages (like English) 
whose writing systems place more emphasis on phonological properties of the 
words. 
Whereas these studies all focused on the phonological level of processing, acoustic 
(not categorical phonological) factors have also been examined with ERPs, and are 
reflected in a MisMatch Negativity (MMN) component, which is a negativity spread- 
ing over the time period for the P2 and N2 (Kraus et al., 1993; Sharma, Kraus, McGee, 
Carrell, & Nicol, 1993; Sams, Aulanko, Aaltonen, & N~i~it~inen, 1990). Similarly, Con- 
nolly and Phillips (1994) found a negativity between 270 and 300 msec that reflected 
phonological expectation independent of semantic expectations. Aaltonen, Tuomainen, 
Laine, and Niemi (1993) used the MMN to show that although all their aphasics show 
MMN discrimination of differing pure tones, those with left posterior damage do not 
show acoustic discrimination at this level of information processing, while their an- 
terior aphasics did. 
Molfese (1978, 1980b) found that it was the right hemisphere and not the expected 
left hemisphere sites that were sensitive to voice onset time (VOT) distinctions in 
consonant discrimination, whereas place of articulation (POA) discriminations were 
found at left hemisphere sites. This was replicated in preschool children (Molfese & 
Molfese, 1988), and Segalowitz and Cohen (1989) replicated this in adults with three 
consonant (C)-vowel (V) contexts: CV, VC, and VCV. Molfese (1980a) argues that 
this right hemisphere effect is due to a general acoustic parser that is sensitive to onset 
time, whether produced in speech or pure tones. 
Intensive study of the speech discrimination abilities of neonates has also been 
successfully explored using ERPs, even though clearly the experimenters have no 
control over subjects' cognitive sets. For example, Molfese, Burger-Judisch, and Hans 
(1991) found that neonates' ERPs discriminate POA. Molfese and Molfese (1985, 
1994) also found that using neonatal ERPs to test for discrimination of stop consonants 
predicts later language development, which fits with Tallal's (Tallal et al., 1996) find- 
ing that children who are at risk for language development are aided by procedures 
that help discriminate precisely those stop consonants. ERP analysis has also been 
used to examine the location of generators in the auditory cortex of infants that pro- 
duce ERPs sensitive to speech signals (Novak, Kurtzberg, Kreuzer, & Vaughan, 
1989). 
5-5.1. Summary 
Thus, ERPs have been shown to be sensitive to various levels of speech analysis: 
phonological and acoustic, and both explicit and implicit processing. ERP data can 
be more sensitive than behavioral responses to phonological effects, presumably be- 
cause they reflect such levels that are inaccessible to conscious responding. In addition, 
some studies have had success in providing some information on physiological gen- 
erators of speech sounds.

5-6. CONCLUSIONS 
5-6.1. Do ERPs Reflect Local Brain Processes? 
We would like to be able to confidently draw conclusions from ERP data about the 
contributions of specific areas of the brain to the underlying linguistic processes. There 
is currently a serious debate as to the extent to which we can make such conclusions. 
Although many researchers are satisfied with 8 or 12 electrode sites to differentiate 
the contributions of different brain areas, others argue that at least 64 or 128 sites are 
needed for reasons of the physics of the electrical activity about the scalp, not to 
mention for capturing the electrical dynamics inherent in the signal (Gevins et al., 
1995; Tucker et al., 1994). Although the field has yet to form a consensus on this 
issue, it is clear that ERPs are useful for differentiating linguistically related processes, 
and can provide at least a gross sense of localization. 
5-6.2. Where Are Words in the Brain? 
ERPs provide a way to reflect the activity of brain circuits that deal with language 
processing. This method appears to complement or actually be richer than the tradi- 
tional behavioral methods. Of course, ERPs do not reflect all neuronal activity of the 
cortex, nor do they provide a set of absolute markers because the details of the ERP 
components are sensitive to the technical parameters of the recordings, and to the 
cognitive context of the stimulus presentation. Much the same can be said, however, 
for behavioral responses that are sensitive to response modality and cognitive task 
requirements. Using these electrical brain responses as dependent measures, we can 
ask psycholinguistic questions about cognitive architecture and we can ask neurolin- 
guistic questions about brain localization and representation. 
Applying ERP technology to studies of subclasses of words can be important for 
several reasons. First of all, although it is obvious that words have to be represented 
in the brain in some manner, it is not at all obvious how they should be subdivided. 
Traditional grammars differentiate open and closed classes of words and differentiate 
nouns and verbs, but finding ERP components sensitive to these differentiations is not 
automatically guaranteed. The aphasia literature suggests a posterior-anterior differ- 
ence on sensitivity to open- and closed-class words, respectively, and the ERP evi- 
dence presented seems to agree, especially with respect to the anterior N280 and 
posterior N350 components. These differences are more likely to arise when the gram- 
matical context provides the subject with some expectation, and thus these ERP com- 
ponents may not reflect purely the lexical access of open- and closed-class words. 
However, the ERP results reinforce the conclusion that there is a clear distinction 
involved in open and closed classes of words. Further work will have to address the 
extent to which the ERP distinction relies on word frequency and word semantics 
rather than grammatical class only. 
Differentiations of nouns from verbs on the basis of semantic factors also shows 
up in the ERE although it is not clear yet whether this is due to the semantic or the 

5

109 
grammatical class difference. Testing for ERPs sensitive to grammatical class in a way 
that is independent of semantic features is not simple and may turn out not to be 
possible. 
Another conclusion from the ERP studies that relates to the testing paradigm con- 
cerns whether lexical decision promotes lexical access in the same way as reading for 
meaning in a phrase or sentence context. The resultant ERPs are not identical. It may 
be that ERP methods will help settle the debate within the field over the extent to 
which the lexical decision paradigm requires phonological and semantic access (Balota 
& Chumbley, 1984; den Heyer, Goring, Gorgichuk, Richards, & Landry, 1988).

CHAPTER 6 
Event-Related Potential (ERP) 
Research in Neurolinguistics" Part II 
Language Processing and Acquisition 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H~l~ne Chevalier 
Department of Psychology, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada L2S 3A1 
In this chapter, we present a review of how event-related potentials (ERPs) have 
been used to reflect semantic and syntactic processing in normal adults and chil- 
dren, both to provide evidence of a neural distinction between semantics and 
syntax and to evaluate specific constructs in linguistic theory. ERPs have also 
been used to test a variety of neurolinguistic hypotheses concerning language 
acquisition (both first and second), reading development, and vocabulary knowl- 
edge in subjects who cannot give responses. We also consider whether ERPs 
reflect specifically linguistic processes or only general responses to cognitive in- 
formation processing. 
6-1. OVERVIEW 
OF THE ISSUES 
Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been successfully applied to questions of lexical 
access (see Segalowitz & Chevalier, this volume). They have also been used to test

specific hypotheses concerning semantic and syntactic processing. The first task has 
been to define which electrophysiological components seem sensitive to semantic 
processing and which to syntactic processing, and whether these are different from 
each other in interesting ways. For nearly two decades, Kutas and her colleagues have 
been exploring how a late negativity in the ERE apparent at posterior electrode sites, 
reflects the subject's detection of a semantic anomaly. This has become a standard 
technique to examine semantic sensitivity, even in subjects who cannot respond in the 
usual fashion (e.g., infants). Detection of syntactic anomalies, on the other hand, pro- 
duces somewhat different patterns of ERP components, allowing one to argue for a 
neural separation of semantic and syntactic processes. Linguistic theory further sug- 
gests many types of syntactic operations, and an examination of the ERPs resulting 
from violation of each type suggests different neural activity for each, although some 
have questioned whether we are seeing a reflection of the linguistic process or its 
cognitive ramifications. 
These techniques have been applied to paradigms examining first and second lan- 
guage acquisition, for example, concerning critical period hypotheses about certain 
aspects of language acquisition. We also discuss ERP studies testing neurolinguistic 
hypotheses about reading and its acquisition using ERPs. 
6-2. DIVISIONS 
BETWEEN 
SYNTAX 
AND SEMANTICS 
6-2.1. The N400 and Semantic Processing 
Maintaining that there is a division between semantics and syntax is not too contro- 
versial, although identifying the dividing point is more difficult. Finding ERP sensi- 
tivity to the division would confirm its suitability in neurolinguistics. One ERP com- 
ponent that clearly responds to semantic processing is the N400, a large negativity 
that covers a broad bilateral posterior area when the subject perceives a semantic 
anomaly but not a syntactic one (Kutas & Hillyard, 1983). For example, the final 
word in "He went to the post office to mail the house" would elicit a large negativity 
posteriorly and bilaterally around 400 msec after the presentation of the final word, 
whereas an expected word does not (see Figure 1). This N400 to semantic anomalies 
has even been reported in an aphasic patient who showed no explicit comprehension, 
raising the issue of unconscious understanding (Revonsuo & Laine, 1996). The se- 
mantic anomaly producing the N400 can be incidental as well as the focus of attention 
(Kutas & Hillyard, 1989; but see Bentin, Kutas, & Hillyard, 1995). It also arises in 
other contexts (e.g., in mismatches in phonology: Kraus et al., 1993; in faces: Barret 
& Rugg, 1989; Bobes, Vald6s-Sosa, & Olivares, 1994; Olivares, Bobes, Aubert, & 
Vald6s-Sosa, 1994; in color patches: Katayama & Yagi, 1992; in pictures: Nigam, 
Hoffman, & Simons, 1992), but that does not diminish its sensitivity to linguistic 
semantics. This negativity is somewhat earlier in natural speech than in reading 
(Holcomb & Neville, 1990, 1991). The N400 component suggests that an expectation

for the word that does appear lessens the negativity (or promotes a positivity) (see 
Rugg, 1995; cf. Van Petten, Kutas, Kluender, Mitchener, & McIsaac, 1991). It has 
been suggested that the semantics-related N400 is linked to activation, at some point 
in the process, in the left angular gyrus, as seen through cerebral glucose metabolism 
rates (Nenov et al., 1991). 
Full sentences are not needed to elicit an N400. Mfinte, Heinze, and Mangun (1993) 
presented word pairs for synonym judgments and found N400s for both verb and noun 
trials (e.g., spend-squander, gangster-robber versus excavate-migrate, parliament- 
cube). When they asked the subjects to rate grammatical acceptability of two-word 
phrases (e.g., "you spend" versus "*your write"), they did find a late negativity, but 
this was 50-80 msec later than in the semantic task and had a greater frontal distri- 
bution, a pattern that has arisen in other studies too. The ERP topographical differ- 
ences between the semantic and syntactic tasks illustrate that there are differences in 
the processing. 
An N400 is also produced by random word lists. Morphologically rectifying the 
list so as to produce a syntactically correct but meaningless sentence does not reduce 
the N400 at all, as in "He ran the half-white car even though he couldn't name the 
raise" (Van Petten & Kutas, 1991). Thus, we can use ERPs to reflect semantic access, 
something that is very popular in the ERP literature on semantic disturbances in 
Alzheimer's dementia (e.g., Hamberger, Friedman, Ritter, & Rosen, 1995; Friedman, 
Hamberger, Stern, & Marder, 1992) and schizophrenia (e.g., Adams et al., 1993). 
The N400 has been used to answer questions of how ambiguous words are proc- 
essed in context. Van Petten (1995) found that sentence context constrained the sense 
of the word from its multiple meanings enough to reduce the N400 effect from the 
priming of a word following the sentence. Similarly, Garnsey, Tanenhaus, and Chap- 
man (1989) used the N400 reaction when confronted with implausibility in sentences 
to show that readers try to interpret a syntactic ambiguity rather than waiting for later 
information to disambiguate it. 
6-2.2. Semantic versus Syntactic ERP Components 
Osterhout and Holcomb (1992) contrasted semantic anomaly with syntactic anomalies 
by presenting sentences some of which had a final word that was semantically anom- 
alous (e.g., *The car rolled down the hill and complained), some of which had in- 
appropriate causal complements (*The woman persuaded to answer the door), some 
of which were normal acceptable nonanomalous simple active sentences (e.g., The 
woman struggled to prepare the meal), and some of which had a variety of other 
grammatical errors. Subjects had to indicate by a button push, after a visual prompt 
appeared, whether the sentence was acceptable or not. The word at which the error 
in the causal complement became apparent elicited a positivity in the 500-800 msec 
range, which they termed the P600. They replicated this in a second study that ex- 
panded the type of grammatical violation, where again, the point at which the subject 
can realize the "garden-path" aspect of the sentence elicited a P600 (replicated and 

6 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part II 
115 
extended in Osterhout, Holcomb, & Swinney, 1994). They noted that in their sen- 
tences, the P600s were elicited to closed-class (CC) or "function" words (which 
marked the divergence from grammatical expectation), whereas the classic N400 is 
elicited to open-class (OC) or "content" words. As they argued, however, one can 
get N400s to CC words given appropriate presentation, suggesting that the P600 is 
really an indication that syntactic violation has cognitive repercussions different 
enough from semantic anomaly to affect the ERP differentially. Osterhout and Hol- 
comb (1993) extended their work to auditory presentation and again found a positivity 
in reaction to being "garden-pathed." This time, however, the positivity often began 
quite a bit earlier (as do N400s to auditory presentation) and appeared over much of 
the 1000 msec ERP duration. 
Similar to Osterhout and Holcomb's (1992) demonstration of a positivity in re- 
sponse to syntactic anomalies, Hagoort, Brown, and Groothusen (1993)report posi- 
tivities in response to difficulties in parsing sentences. Concerned that the overt making 
of a grammatical judgment influenced the ERE they had subjects simply read (without 
overt response) sentences half of which had either a subject-verb nonagreement (*On 
a rainy day the old man buy a life insurance), verb subcategorization error (e.g., *The 
tired young man elapsed the book on the floor), or noun phrase structure order vio- 
lation (e.g., *Most of the visitors like the colourful very tulips in Holland). Note that 
in this study the subject was alerted to the anomaly by OC items, in contrast to 
Osterhout and Holcomb (1992, 1993). About 500 msec after the subject-verb nona- 
greement, a posterior positivity arose that was sustained through the following word 
and then became a sustained negativity. The other grammatical violations (verb sub- 
categorization and noun phrase structure violation) produced some results difficult to 
interpret, such as sustained shifts prior to the grammar violation. For the interpretable 
results, Hagoort et al. (1993) suggest that their Syntactic Positivity Shift (akin to 
Osterhout's P600) reflects the difficulty the grammatical parser was having dealing 
with the sentences. A similar interpretation was placed on an earlier-occurring posi- 
tivity (P345) that arose in the context of making sense of subject- versus object-relative 
clauses (Mecklinger, Schriefers, Steinhauer, & Friederici, 1995). 
This tidy picture of N400s for semantic anomalies and P600s for syntactic anom- 
alies is clouded somewhat by the findings of Friederici, Pfeifer, and Hahne (1993, 
much of which was replicated by R6sler, Pfitz, Friederici, & Hahne, 1993), who ex- 
amined ERPs to spoken sentences with or without a semantic error (incorrect selec- 
tional restriction), morphological error (incorrect verb inflection), or syntactic error 
(phrase structure violation). They found large N400s to both semantic and morpho- 
logical errors at all electrode sites (left and right "Broca's" sites, left and right "Wer- 
nicke's," and Fz, Cz, and Pz), but the morphological errors also produced a primarily 
posterior positivity after about 700 msec. The syntactic violations elicited a small 
anterior negativity at about 180 msec, primarily at the Broca's-left site, followed by 
a frontal negativity in the N400 time frame. Although the late positivity is reminiscent 
of the P600 notion, why it did not emerge for the syntactic violations as well is not 
clear. The semantic-syntactic ERP distinction is further complicated by the results of 
Osterhout's (in press) study showing that, in response to a sentence-final syntactic 

116 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H~l~ne Chevalier 
anomaly (on an OC word), some subjects are prone to producing a P600 and others 
an N400. This raises the issue of whether subjects have the option of treating the 
anomaly in one of two ways (as a syntactic reparsing difficulty versus a semantic 
misfit) or whether subjects have different organization for language. 
6-2.3. Specific Questions of Grammar Theory 
Although the N400 was originally taken as a reflection of linguistic semantic proc- 
essing (Kutas & Van Petten, 1988), this position has changed to include expectation 
in more contexts of meaning (Kutas & Van Petten, 1994), that is, the N400 may not 
be a reflection of lexical semantics per se but of the mental processing requirements 
that arise when a revision of expectation is required, in a general sense. In time the 
same attribution of processing requirements may befall the P600. Using the N400 and 
the like to index processing effort opens up an entirely new way to investigate psy- 
cholinguistic phenomena. This use of ERP components has been applied to online 
sentence processing in studies designed to investigate dissociations predicted by syn- 
tactic theory. The assumption is that cognitive events that are mediated by different 
computational substructures should elicit differing ERPs. 
One of the complexities of grammatical decoding is the pairing of relative pronouns 
with the place of their missing referent. This place is called the "gap" and can be 
illustrated by the sentence "What did you say 
to John?" where the initial 
wh-word is an element that has been moved from where the line appears, leaving a 
"trace" behind. Kluender and Kutas (1993b) refer to this as a "filler" for the object 
that is missing later on in the sentence. Various wh-questions can be distinguished 
from each other according to Government and Binding (GB) linguistic theory (Chom- 
sky, 1981) on the basis of the rules used to construct them, which is the focus of 
Neville, Nicol, Barss, Forster, and Garrett (1991). 
Neville et al. (1991) examined whether three types of syntactic deviance predicted 
by GB theory are reflected in different ERP patterns (taken to the italicized comparison 
words), in a way that contrasts with semantic anomaly (e.g., *The boys heard Joe's 
orange about Africa). The three syntactic deviation types were 
1. Phrase structure violations: The prepositions of and about appear left instead of 
right of the head noun, producing the form 
[NP's of Noun NP] 
e.g., *The man admired Don's of sketch the landscape. 
or 
[NP's about Noun NP] 
e.g., *The student sang Lisa's about songs freedom. 
2. Specificity violations: Wh-phrases cannot be extracted from an NP with a spe- 
cific reference, so, 
e.g., What did the scientist criticize a proof of? 
is acceptable but, 
e.g., *What did the scientist criticize Max's proof of? 

6 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part II 
117 
is not. Since specificity is a semantic notion, this sentence's violation is in 
both semantic and syntactic aspects. 
3. Subjacency violations: It is ungrammatical to extract a wh-phrase from inside 
the subject NP, a point that is subsumed under the Subjacency Condition. So, 
e.g., Was a sketch of the landscape admired by the man? 
is acceptable but, 
e.g., *What was a sketch of admired by the man? 
is not. Subjects were asked to make acceptability judgments, and ERPs were 
taken from the onset of the comparison words. 
Semantic anomalies elicited an N400 (300-500 msec) that was bilateral and larger 
posteriorly, as expected (see Figure 2). Phrase structure violations elicited an increased 
N125, limited to left anterior regions, followed by a left temporal and parietal N400, 
followed by a large bilateral positivity starting at around 500 msec. Specificity vio- 
lations elicited an increased N125 over left anterior regions and the N400 over the 
left frontal and temporal regions. Subjacency violations increased the P2 (200-300 
msec) at all but occipital sites and the 500+ msec positivity at all sites. Thus, each 
type of syntactic deviation elicited a specific pattern of ERP alterations, supporting 
the hypotheses. Neville et al. (1991) also concluded that the classic N400 (bilateral, 
posterior) only appeared to semantic anomalies, although there were other topograph- 
ical patterns of negativities in this time frame. It may be that distinctive patterns of 
ERP changes are associated with different types of syntactic violation because of the 
different location of linguistic difficulty, both cognitively and physiologically. Alter- 
natively, as Neville et al. (1991) point out, such differences may also be due to dif- 
ferences in the ease of recovery from the violations. Note that there was no ERP 
change that was general to all syntactic disturbances, so the different ERP "markers" 
of the deviations may be a result of the standard ERP being affected by the various 
time frames in the recovery function. However, we can note that the two types of 
violations (phrase structure and subjacency) that produced the late positivity (perhaps 
a P600) were the ones where the word immediately before the deviation forms an 
unacceptable sequence with the deviating word (e.g., "Don's of" and "of admired"), 
while the word pair at the specificity violation forms an acceptable phrase (e.g., 
"Max's proof"). 
Another approach is to use wh-words because they force the reader to keep the 
filler in working memory until the gap appears. Varying the length of this gap and 
seeing the effect on ERPs was the subject of Kluender and Kutas' (1993a, 1993b) 
studies. Like Neville et al. (1991), Kluender and Kutas (1993b) took ERPs to online 
sentence processing, visually presenting one word at a time. This study was done in 
the context of whether some of the principles associated with subjacency should be 
attributed to specific innate linguistic mechanisms or to a more general processing 
limitation related to the nature of the grammatical requirements. They hypothesized 
that N400 amplitude would index processing effort, a notion that contrasts with the 
interpretation outlined earlier of the ERP reflecting lexical access rather than the on- 
going working memory requirements (see also Gunter, Jackson, & Mulder, 1995 for

a treatment of N400 as a reflection of working memory requirements of sentence 
processing). Kluender and Kutas (1993b) found different N400 amplitudes for the 
different function words that, if and what~who, concluding that within the CC word 
category, different items have different processing requirements. If and what~who dif- 
fered in N400 amplitude despite similar grammatical frames and word frequencies. 
They also found that the processing cost of holding a filler in working memory was 
reflected in a left anterior negativity (LAN) associated with the hypothesized ordering 
of difficulty, namely, who~what > if > that. Similarly, Kluender and Kutas (1993b) 
cite other work from their laboratory indicating that object relative clauses show 
greater LAN compared with the relatively easy subject relative clauses. Object rela- 
tives require a filler to be kept in working memory, for example, 
The reporter who the senator harshly attacked ~ 
admitted the error. 
whereas subject relatives are immediately assigned to the adjacent gap, for example, 
The reporter who 
harshly attacked the senator admitted the error. 
with the negativity starting at precisely the time when the filler has to be maintained. 
As would be expected, individuals with poorer verbal working memory produce larger 
LANs in this context (King & Kutas, 1995). Other LAN effects are reviewed by 
Kluender and Kutas (1993b, pp. 623-624) and more supporting data are presented by 
Kluender and Kutas (1993a). 
6-3. DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES AND SECOND 
LANGUAGE ACQUISITION 
The notion of developmentally sensitive periods is well established in neurobiology, 
and there is no reason to think the neurobiology of language should prove an excep- 
tion. What has been generally found is that what we think of as standard neural 
organization (for example, of the visual system) is in fact dependent on standard 
experiences within a standard time frame. Alteration of the earliest visual experiences 
(Freeman & Thibos, 1973) or the removal of early auditory experiences (Neville, 
Schmidt, & Kutas, 1983) results in changed neural organization for visual experiences. 
In a series of studies, Neville and her colleagues also examined the OC/CC distinction, 
semantic processing, and sensitivity to syntactic anomalies in American Sign Lan- 
guage (ASL) and English in deaf and hearing adults, and in English in Chinese- 
English bilinguals who acquired English at different ages. 
The deaf adults had acquired ASL as a first language (L 1) and English as a second 
language (L2), and some of the hearing controls also learned ASL as L 1, having been 
born to deaf parents. Semantic anomalies in English elicited N400 ERP components 
in deaf subjects essentially identical to those from hearing subjects, although the peak 
negativity was about 25 msec later (Neville, Mills, & Lawson, 1992). Similarly, ERPs 
to OC words were also identical in deaf and hearing groups in terms of P100, N 170, 

120 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H~l~ne Chevalier 
N350, and LPC components. However, CC words did not elicit the asymmetrical N 180 
among deaf subjects as they did in hearing subjects, but rather a symmetrical non- 
highly focused scalp distribution (Neville et al., 1992). 
Neville et al. (1997) have also examined OC/CC distinctions in ERPs elicited to 
ASL signs among profoundly deaf adults, hearing native users of ASL, and fluent 
hearing late learners of ASL. When tested in ASL, deaf subjects reacted to OC and 
CC words in much the same way as hearing subjects react to English OC and CC 
words, except that the early negative component to CC words (N280) in English 
that is absent to OC words (a) is also present but reduced for ASL OC words in 
deaf subjects, (b) shows less asymmetry in deaf subjects, and (c) is slightly earlier 
(N250). 
Hearing adults who are native signers produced ERPs to OC and CC signs that 
were much the same as the deaf adults. The differences were independent of word- 
class membership and therefore probably due to the hearing loss in the deaf adults. 
Hearing late learners of ASL (after 17 years of age) produced the N250 anteriorly 
and the N400 posteriorly, as did hearing native signers, but showed no word-class 
effect for the N250! Thus the anterior ERP marker for the OC/CC distinction was 
sensitive either to age of language acquisition or to the L1/L2 distinction. 
To further examine the effects of age of language acquisition on ERP components 
sensitive to semantic and syntactic structures, Weber-Fox and Neville (1996) presented 
the sentences with three types of syntactic violations and with semantic anomalies 
described earlier from Neville et al. (1991) to 61 Chinese-English bilingual adults. 
They classified subjects with respect to the age at which they were exposed to English 
(1-3, 4-6, 7-10, 11-13, and after 16 years of age). Age had a major effect on gram- 
maticality judgments and associated ERP components, even in those whose exposure 
to English began in the earliest period. In contrast, the N400 and semantic anomaly 
judgments were altered only in subjects exposed to English after age 11, and in these 
groups there was simply a delay in N400 peak amplitude. For the syntactic judgments, 
however, those exposed to English later in development had ERPs that were different 
in both the morphology and the distribution of components. Thus age of acquisition, 
rather than the L1/L2 distinction per se, appears to be the essential factor modulating 
the representation of grammatical processes in the brain. 
6-4. ASSESSING 
RECEPTIVE 
LINGUISTIC 
COMPETENCE 
WITHOUT 
BEHAVIORAL 
PRODUCTION 
Since ERPs reflect ongoing brain activity in response to stimulation without the need 
for overt behavioral response, the technique should be applicable to subjects who for 
some reason cannot respond, for example, studies of speech perception in infancy (see 
Segalowitz & Berge, 1995 for a review). Molfese and his associates have also shown 
that ERPs are sensitive to whether children know the stimulus words or not (Molfese, 
1989, 1990; Molfese, Wetzel, & Gill, 1993); they also taught new words to babies as 

6 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part II 
121 
young as 14 months and found ERPs sensitive to this new learning (Molfese, 1989; 
Molfese, Morse, & Peters, 1990; Molfese, & Wetzel, 1992). Similarly, Mills, Coffey- 
Corina, and Neville (1993) found that ERPs discriminated known from unknown 
words among 20-month-olds, and that a pattern of hemispheric specialization in- 
creased with increased language ability. 
Applying this approach to children with language production difficulties, Byrne, 
Dywan, and Connolly (1995a) showed that a nonverbal child with cerebral palsy 
produced N400s to nonmatching picture-word pairs compared to matching ones, 
showing that he understood much more vocabulary than he could demonstrate behav- 
iorally. Similarly, children show N400s in this paradigm at a level commensurate with 
their expected vocabulary level (Byrne, Dywan, & Connolly, 1995b). 
6-5. SOME 
QUESTIONS 
ABOUT 
READING 
There are a large number of questions in the study of reading that can be addressed 
with ERPs. Halgren (1990) presents an integrative model of neural and cognitive bases 
for reading at the many levels of processing involved, showing how ERPs have been 
used at each level. Sentence context versus the reading of isolated words is explored 
with ERPs by Kutas (1993) and Van Petten (1993). Rugg, Doyle, and Melan (1993) 
give ERP evidence for the hypothesis that heard words generate a phonological rep- 
resentation only, whereas read words generate both orthographic and phonological 
representation. There is clearly a great deal that can be addressed in the study of 
reading using ERPs. We will briefly discuss only a few hypotheses. 
6-5.1. Phonological versus Semantic Access in Reading 
Peres-Abalo, Rodriguez, Bobes, Gutierrez, and Vald6s-Sosa (1994) suggest that se- 
mantic access is faster to printed words than is phonological access, contrary to tra- 
ditional reading theory. They showed this by comparing ERPs to match and mismatch 
trials in a semantic versus rhyming condition and found that the difference between 
the ERPs to semantic match and mismatch trials was significantly earlier than the 
difference for the phonological trials. Thus, the subjects' ERPs were sensitive more 
quickly to semantic information than to phonological information from printed words. 
6-5.2. Hemispheric Processes in Reading and Dyslexia 
Bakker (1990) outlines his research with colleagues involving ERPs from children at 
various stages of learning to read their native language (Dutch). They reported an 
initially larger ERP response to words over right hemisphere sites that switches during 
their first year of schooling to a large left hemisphere response. They argue that 
children shift from a slower right hemisphere dominance in processing letter infor- 
mation to a faster left hemisphere one as they become more fluent. They also report 
that some children have difficulty learning to read because they read extremely slowly 

122 
Sidney J. Segalowitz and H61~ne Chevalier 
and appear to not shift from this right hemisphere dominance. Other children, whose 
reading is hindered by excessive rapidity and error proneness, switch too quickly. 
Bakker (1990, 1994) has developed a remedial strategy based on this hypothesis. 
Another hemispheric-reading hypothesis concerns the issue of two routes to read- 
ing, that is, the notion that reading English involves a phonologically based route and 
a visually based route (Coltheart, 1985). Reasoning that these may be based on a left- 
versus right-hemisphere mechanism, respectively, Segalowitz, Menna, and MacGregor 
(1987; Segalowitz, 1989) presented letter-string pairs and subjects were to indicate 
whether they were identical or not. Pronounceable letter strings elicited ERPs at left 
hemisphere sites that were greater in amplitude than at right hemisphere sites, whereas 
nonpronounceable letter strings elicited the opposite. They reasoned that pronounce- 
able letter strings would be more likely to induce phonological access, whereas non- 
pronounceable letter strings would more likely induce visual memory processes. Thus, 
the results supported the two routes-two hemisphere model. Segalowitz, Wagner, and 
Menna (1992) then replicated these results in 15-year-olds, where good readers showed 
this pattern but poor readers did not. However, neither was their degree of reading 
difficulty predicted by their degree of "inappropriate" hemispheric asymmetry in the 
ERP Rather, it was the size of the interstimulus negativity in the matching task, 
presumed to be generated in the prefrontal cortex, that was predictive of their reading 
skill. 
6-6. CONCLUSIONS 
It is now evident that ERPs have been a highly useful tool to test linguistic or psy- 
cholinguistic hypotheses concerning syntactic theory and first or second language ac- 
quisition. In addition, ERPs have provided some support for working hypotheses about 
the location of cortical sensitivity to semantic and syntactic processes, and again how 
these may differ in first versus second language acquisition. We must also be sensitive 
to the controversies about how to get the most from ERP data and about the inter- 
pretation of ERPs as reflections of brain processes as opposed to cognitive processes. 
6-6.1. Getting the Most from Linguistically Driven ERPs 
It would be nice if ERPs reflected ongoing processing of linguistic phenomena qua 
linguistic phenomena and not as general cognitive phenomena. Buried in the ERP 
signal may be some pattern-capturing variance specific to individual phonemic (per- 
haps even phonetic) features of words, specific to the features activated through lexical 
access, specific to the mental computations associated with grammatical parsing. These 
patterns may be discernible with the precision available with truly multivariate analysis 
of the ERP patterns across the scalp, that is, taking into account all scalp sites in a 
single multivariate data space. This is the goal of the PCA-ANOVA technique, where 
the ERPs from all sites and all conditions are entered into a Principal Components 
Analysis in order to find these sources of variances. This has been done with some 

6 
ERPs in Neurolinguistics, Part II 
123 
success in language studies (e.g., Molfese, 1978; Segalowitz & Cohen, 1989), but also 
is open to difficulties in statistical analysis and interpretation that may limit its use to 
only quickly processed phonetic stimuli (see Segalowitz & Berge, 1995 for a discus- 
sion of some concerns in using this technique). New techniques along these lines seem 
to be focusing on finding physiological generator sources (Picton, Lins, & Sherg, 
1995), which is of course not exactly the same problem but may be amenable to some 
aspects of neurolinguistic issues (e.g., Pulvermfiller, Preissl, Lutzenberger, & Birbau- 
mer, 1996). 
6-6.2. Do ERPs Reflect Linguistic or Cognitive Phenomena? 
Whether or not an adequately sophisticated statistical procedure can be found, we still 
have to face another serious concern. The assumption in ERP research is that there is 
sufficient variance in the ERP to capture the psycholinguistic features of interest. 
However, we know that the largest variance in the ERP is common to many para- 
digms-the N1, P2, N2, P3, N400, late positivity--and these are usually interpreted 
as reflecting primarily attentional processing demands. Thus any overlay of purely 
psycholinguistic variance will be highly obscured in the general ERP paradigm by 
factors related to working memory demands, attentional allocation, general stimulus 
processing, response and task demands, degrees of stimulus familiarity, and so on. 
We have seen some shift along these lines already, with left frontal negativity being 
attributed to working memory demands and N400 and P600 amplitudes being attrib- 
uted to the processing efforts required from the subject. Although they do not provide 
the "magic bullet" that will cleanly characterize the brain activities specific to lin- 
guistic computation, ERPs nonetheless provide a rich window on the cognitive reper- 
cussions of language processing.

CHAPTER 7 
Electrical Stimulation Mapping 
of Language Cortex 
Harry A. Whitaker 
Department of Psychology, Northern Michigan University, Marquette, Michigan 49855 
Three techniques for electrical stimulation mapping of language cortex in the 
human brain are discussed: how they are done, the advantages and disadvantages 
of each and both the general and specific results of using these techniques in 
connection with epilepsy surgery. 
Focal electrical stimulation of the human brain (fESB) for the purpose of mapping 
functions such as the location of motor or sensory cortex and the identification of 
language or memory cortex is an adventitious research technique usually incidental to 
the clinical requirements of surgery for epilepsy. During certain other neurosurgical pro- 
cedures, such as removing an arteriovenus malformation (AVM) or occasionally during 
tumor surgery, there is also a need for and opportunity to conduct fESB. The purpose 
of fESB is simple: before removing a piece of damaged or malfunctioning brain, it is 
important to know whether or not that part plays a critical role in motor, sensory, 
language, or memory functions. Experience has shown that such functions may be 
found in epileptic brain, in an AVM, or in a tumor; information about these functions 
may modify a neurosurgeon's operative plans. Experience has also shown that, on 
occasion, a region of brain that, based on textbook maps, one supposes to be critical 
for motor, sensory, or language functions is in fact silent and thus could be removed. 
Thus, in assessing fESB's contribution to neurolinguistics, one should keep in mind 
that there are structural brain abnormalities with accompanying neurological impair- 
ments in all subjects studied using this technique. On the other hand, it is equally

important to remember that fESB has been applied to both presumed normal and 
abnormal brain regions with quite comparable results. Furthermore, electrical stimu- 
lation results have been comparable no matter what the lesion type--tumor, AVM, 
gliosis, and so on. 
7-1. TECHNIQUES 
Over the past quarter-century, certain features of fESB have become standard: current 
is delivered across bipolar electrode contacts, using pulsed square waves with equal 
positive and negative excursion so that the net coulombs entering brain tissue is zero; 
stimulus duration is typically on the order of seconds, and thus there is no demon- 
strable tissue damage associated with the fESB. Because the distance between elec- 
trodes is minimal, usually on the order of 5 mm, one may regard fESB as creating a 
temporary, immediately reversible, focal area of functional loss, one discrete location 
at a time. These facts, coupled with the experimental rigor employed by most re- 
searchers using fESB, argue for a fair degree of confidence in the general results. 
There are three different fESB techniques, one acute and two chronic: (a) a 
hand-held electrode, usually bipolar, that briefly contacts the brain's surface during a 
neurosurgical operation; (b) a flexible strip or grid of electrodes that is placed sub- 
durally on the surface of the brain for varying periods from hours, intraoperatively, 
to weeks, interoperatively; and (c) a small-diameter rod (depth electrode) with several 
contacts along its length that is inserted into the brain for varying periods, from days 
to weeks, interoperatively. Hand-held electrodes can only be used intraoperatively and 
only on the brain surface that has been exposed when a section of the cranium has 
been removed. Both grid and strip electrodes may be slipped under the dura mater to 
make contact with, for example, mesial frontal lobe, inferior temporal lobe, or pos- 
terior occipital lobe, areas of brain that are adjacent to the area exposed by the skull 
opening; strip electrodes may also be inserted through burr holes, thus not requiring 
a full skull flap procedure. Depth electrodes are usually placed through small burr 
holes, which may be made in just about any part of the cranium lying over the brain; 
unlike the other two techniques, depth electrodes are designed to access deep brain 
structures, and, unlike the other two types, depth electrodes cause a small lesion along 
the track of the electrode. 
7-2. ADVANTAGES 
AND DISADVANTAGES 
OF EACH 
TECHNIQUE 
Although in the past different neurosurgical centers tended to use one or another of 
these techniques predominantly, today most neurosurgeons will adapt their technique 
to the exigencies of each particular case. Strip electrodes are commonly used by 
everyone because they can be placed in areas and in ways that simply cannot be 
duplicated by hand-held or depth electrodes. Depth electrodes, as well as strip elec- 
trodes, have the advantage of being able to access both hemispheres at the same time, 
whereas the hand-held electrode is restricted to the exposed craniotomy field during 

7 
Electrical Stimulation Mapping of Language Cortex 
127 
an operation, thus to a single hemisphere. Strip electrodes have varying numbers of 
contacts, from a few to 5 dozen; because the electrode contacts are embedded in a 
flexible plastic sheet, they may be trimmed to different shapes--from a long strip with 
a single line of contacts to a large square with a field of contacts. Thus, in terms of 
area of coverage, strip electrodes are quite useful; the contacts are fixed in the plastic 
sheet, but the whole strip can be repositioned. Thus a varying number of contacts will 
actually not be active, fortuitously being positioned over a sulcus, an artery, or a vein. 
For excellent control over the precise site to be stimulated, the hand-held electrode is 
superior. Depth electrodes, of course, are able to access brain structures below the 
surface; since they must be inserted directly through brain substance and brain sub- 
stance is highly vascularized, there is greater risk of medical complications with depth 
electrodes than with the other two types. Except in certain cases of chronic, thalamic 
pain, depth electrodes are typically not left in place for long periods of time, although 
they could be; strip electrodes are often left in place for a week, which, of course, 
greatly increases the opportunity for clinical and experimental observation of fESB. 
The hand-held electrode is limited to use during neurosurgical procedures. 
7-3. BACKGROUND: EARLY FINDINGS 
Focal electrical stimulation was first used in the late 19th century, in an attempt to 
answer the question originally posed by Albrecht Hailer as to whether the cerebral 
cortex was "excitable" or passive (Neuberger, 1897/1981). The first report of the 
effects of faradic current applied directly to the human brain was by Bartholow (1874). 
In reviewing the status of localization studies at that time, Bartholow stated: 
The most important results as regards localization of functions, have been obtained by far- 
adization of limited parts of the brain. The demonstrations recently made in this way by 
Fritsch and Hitzig (Archiv f Anat. Physiol. u. Wissenschaftliche Medizin, 3, 1870) and by 
Ferrier (West Riding Lunatic Asylum Reports, vol. 3) are entirely opposed to the well-known 
experiments of Magendie, Longet, Flourens, Vulpian and others, which had apparently 
shown the inexcitability of the cerebral hemispheres. (1874, p. 306) 
Stimulating both the left and right anterior parietal lobes through a tumor-caused skull 
defect, Bartholow observed contralateral muscular contractions in hand, arm, leg, and 
neck muscles in his patient. It was quickly realized that the technique could be used 
to functionally map the motor and sensory regions of the cortex, and soon fESB was 
considered to have furnished the proof of functional cortical localization (Bolton, 
1911). The first report of stimulation mapping in a conscious human patient under- 
going neurosurgery was made by Cushing (1909); he stimulated the postcentral gyrus 
and produced sensations in the contralateral limbs. 
7-4. MODERN STUDIES 
The most extensive and best-known premodern series on the effects of electrical 
stimulation, including speech and language effects, are those of Penfield and his 

128 
Harry A. Whitaker 
colleagues, collected in Penfield and Erickson (1941), Penfield and Jasper (1954), 
Penfield (1967), Penfield and Roberts (1959), and Penfield and Perot (1963). The 
modern era of fESB using the hand-held electrode was ushered in by the work of 
John van Buren and colleagues (Ojemann, Fedio, & Van Buren, 1968), continued in 
the work of George Ojemann and colleagues (Ojemann, 1975; Ojemann & Whitaker, 
1978a; Ojemann & Whitaker, 1978b; Ojemann & Mateer, 1979), surveyed in Ojemann 
(1983), and summarized in Ojemann, Ojemann, Lettich, and Berger (1989). Modern 
studies using the depth electrode technique (pioneered by J. Talairach) were developed 
by Jean-Marc Saint-Hillaire and colleagues (Richer, Martinez, Robert, Bouvier, & 
Saint-Hillaire, 1993) and the modern studies using chronically implanted strip elec- 
trodes were pioneered by Ron Lesser and his colleagues (Gordon, 1997; Gordon, Hart, 
Lesser, & Arroyo, 1996; Gordon et al., 1994; Crone, Hart, Boatman, Lesser, & Gor- 
don, 1994; Hart & Gordon, 1992; Boatman et al., 1992; Gordon et al., 1991; Lueders 
et al., 1991; Gordon, Lesser, & Hart, 1989; Lueders et al., 1987; Lesser et al., 1987. 
7-5. COMPARISON WITH OTHER 
MAPPING TECHNIQUES 
Optical image mapping takes advantage of the fact that a decrease in the light reflec- 
tance properties of cortex correlates with increased neuronal activity. Optical image 
studies are similar to fESB in that they also exhibit discrete sites for motor control of 
the vocal tract and for naming responses. Studies that have compared the location of 
optical changes with naming with the fESB location of naming sites have shown a 
close correspondence of results (Haglund, Ojemann, & Hochman, 1992; Hochman, 
Whitaker, Haglund, & Ojemann, 1995); and fESB identification of motor cortex cor- 
responds to magnetic resonance images of gyral topography (Berger, Cohen, & Oje- 
mann, 1990). Overall, fESB localization data is consistent with data obtained from 
other sources such as PET, fMRI, regional electrical activity recorded directly from 
the cortex, magnetoencephalography, and single-unit data (Gordon, 1997; Ojemann, 
Creutzfeldt, Lettich, & Haglund, 1988). 
7-6. GENERAL 
RESULTS 
The most systematic and interesting set of critical commentaries of fESB--technique 
and results--is to be found in the discussions following the target article by Ojemann 
(1983). The comments by Cooper (1983), Marshall (1983), and Studdert-Kennedy 
(1983) were particularly relevant to the interpretation of fESB data. Many of the 
questions raised in these commentaries have been addressed in electrical stimulation 
research since the early 1980s; combining the studies of Ojemann's and Lesser's teams, 
more than 200 subjects have been studied using fESB. Broadly speaking, fESB tends 
to support the classical model in neurolinguistics; as stated by Gordon et al. (1994), 
"language functions need to be understood in terms of their underlying componential 
processes. For the most part, the gross outline of these componential processes (e.g., 

7 
Electrical Stimulation Mapping of Language Cortex 
129 
for reading: a visual orthographic lexicon, semantics, a semantic-to-phonologic con- 
version process, and output phonology) resembles the general outlines currently pop- 
ular" in neurolinguistics (p. 5). They continue: "evidence suggests the existence of 
very fine subdivisions in the representation of language (perhaps analogous to the 
multiple maps seen in the visual system" (ibid.) and conclude that the fESB results 
indicate that the more finely grained a linguistic function is, the more narrowly lo- 
calized is its cortical representation. 
7-7. SPECIFIC RESULTS 
Franz Joseph Gall's organology of the early 19th century was, above all, a neuro- 
psychology of individual differences. The question of individual differences also oc- 
cupied the minds of the late-19th- and early 20th-century anatomists who, by all 
accounts, had given up hope of describing a consistent gyral geography of the human 
brain (Whitaker & Selnes, 1976). Individual difference has returned with a vengeance 
in fESB research; if anything has been clearly demonstrated by electrical stimulation 
studies, it is that no two individual brains have the same geographic/functional location 
for language. In addition, fESB has provided evidence of linguistic functioning in 
regions of the brain heretofore suspected but not known to be language cortex, namely, 
the insula, anterior temporal lobe, inferior/basal temporal lobe, and ventrolateral thal- 
amus. Studies of patients who speak more than one language (Ojemann & Whitaker, 
1978a, 1978b; Ojemann, 1983; Rapport, Tan, & Whitaker, 1983) have clearly dem- 
onstrated that multiple languages are differentially localized in the cortex. Since these 
reports were published, a dozen more bilingual patients have been studied, with the 
same results: there are sites where one or the other language is represented exclusively, 
sites where both languages are equally represented, and sites where both are repre- 
sented, but to an unequal degree (Ojemann & Whitaker, unpublished data). 
Dissociations of components of language processing are the meat and potatoes of 
neurolinguistic research; in fESB research, dissociations are commonplace, due prob- 
ably to the precision with which fESB can functionally disrupt a relatively small piece 
of brain, as noted by Gordon et al. (1994). Some of the observed dissociations are a 
pure impairment of input phonology, a pure impairment of auditory comprehension, 
a pure impairment of spontaneous speech, a pure impairment of visual confrontation 
naming, and a pure impairment of single-word reading, where "pure" means that 
fESB did not impair any other language functions at that time and at that site. It is, 
of course, also common to find two or more linguistic functions interrupted by fESB 
at the same site (Ojemann & Whitaker, 1978b; Ojemann, 1983; and the various papers 
by Gordon and colleagues). The patterns of single and multiple functional disruption 
appear to be consistent with a network of interrelated nodes for different functional 
systems. Some of the mixed functional localizations are rather interesting in that they 
have not been reported in the lesion literature, for example, an auditory comprehension 
impairment and impaired repetition with impaired visual confrontation naming and 
naming to definition but with completely preserved spontaneous speech and reading 

130 
Harry A. Whitaker 
(Gordon et al., 1994). Occasionally an unusual localization is found, one that seems 
quite different from the standard lesion literature, for example, the finding of impaired 
word reading only when anterior inferior temporal lobe was stimulated (Gordon et al., 
1995). Functional electrical stimulation has also been employed in the nonlanguage- 
dominant (right) hemisphere; although some studies report no language functions, 
others report that simpler, overlearned lexical tasks may employ nondominant hemi- 
sphere systems (Bhatnagar & Andy, 1981; Andy & Bhatnagar, 1984). 
Ever since Penfield and Jasper (1941) reported unusual psychic phenomena asso- 
ciated with fESB, there have been unique, clinical observations of linguistic phenom- 
ena elicited by electrical stimulation. Until these are experimentally supported, they 
remain tantalizing windows on future research, but their intrinsic interest warrants 
some mention. In collaboration with George Ojemann and colleagues, the present 
author has observed effects of fESB such as the following: jargon aphasic responses 
and semantic paraphasic responses in visual confrontation naming tasks, function word 
and derivational affix errors in reading tasks and semantic category errors (i.e., fruits 
and vegetables versus musical instruments being differentially affected by focal elec- 
trical stimulation). Coupled with the increased availability of optical and metabolic 
imaging techniques that can be correlated with the results of fESB, it would seem that 
the future of this research is bright and promising.

Tomographic Brain Imaging 
of Language Functions 
Prospects for a New Brain~Language Model 
Jean-Francois D6monet 
INSERM U455, H6pital Purpan, Toulouse Cedex, France 
Advanced brain mapping techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography and 
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging represent a major step toward better 
understanding the neural correlates of language functions, as these studies, con- 
ducted in normal subjects while performing language activation tasks, produce 
results that are independent of the classical clinico-anatomic method in aphasic 
patients. Both functional mapping and lesion-based methods may be combined 
to study the functional basis of recovery from aphasia. However, the changes in 
brain regions that are recorded by these techniques actually reflect very complex 
phenomena related to functions (and dysfunctions) of widely distributed and 
adapting neural ensembles that subserve language processes. As a new scientific 
field, functional imaging studies require the combination of many different ex- 
pertises, from cognitive psychology to physics, in order to get accurate and com- 
prehensive interpretations of their results. Some key methodological issues and 
examples of results are presented in this chapter. 
Since the 19th century, many attempts have been made to establish clear-cut relation- 
ships between aphasia and brain lesions, using aphasia as a paradigm to build up a 
model of brain/language relationships. Although some parts of this lesion-based model 
are quite well established (e.g., the critical role of Wernicke's area for decoding

132 
Jean-Frangois D6monet 
and encoding spoken words), many other aspects still remain poorly specified due to 
several factors of complexity. First, the relationships between lesion anatomy and 
language disorders appear more stable when aphasic symptoms--rather than syn- 
dromes-are considered (Poeck, 1983; Willmes & Poeck, 1993). Second, in accord 
with current theories on the neural correlates of cognitive functions (Damasio, 1989; 
Mesulam, 1990), many aphasic symptoms, for example, anomia, correspond to various 
lesion sites and are, in fact, linked to a "distributed anatomy" of lesions (Alexander, 
Hiltbrunner, & Fischer, 1989), the same language disorder being induced by lesions 
of different nodes of a network distributed over the left hemisphere, if not the entire 
brain. Third, a variety of "additional" factors have been invoked to account for "ex- 
ceptional aphasias" (Basso, Lecours, Moraschini, & Vanier, 1985), that is, cases that 
are at variance with the classical teaching on lesion-symptom relationships. Subject- 
specific factors (e.g., handedness, age, gender, cultural factors) together with recovery 
and compensation phenomena are very likely to influence the aphasiological model. 
Because of highly complex interactions between these factors and the consequences 
of brain lesions, the heuristic value of the aphasiological model by itself appears 
limited; and modern functional imaging techniques, for example, PET or fMRI, have 
the potential to renew this research because they generate data that are independent 
of the aphasiological framework. These techniques, which have dramatically improved 
recently in terms of sensitivity, resolution, and reliability, can be combined with a 
new paradigm, namely, cognitive brain activation, to provide information on the lo- 
cation of functional changes in the brain while normal subjects perform language 
tasks. Language activation studies in normal subjects should therefore fruitfully com- 
plement previous aphasiological views on the brain correlates of language functions. 
Most important, these techniques should, sooner or later, help us understand more 
about recovery from acquired cognitive dysfunctions such as aphasia.

Isotopic techniques--for example, PET--have been used for about 30 years to meas-

(Lassen & Ingvar, 1961). Computed from measurements of the dynamics of radioac- 
tivity counts emitted from the brain by short-lived isotopes such as oxygen 15, regional 
Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) is the most frequently used functional index of metabolic 
activities in underlying neural populations. Local changes in brain arterioles and cap-

illaries are related, although not proportionally (cf. section 8-1.3. on functional Mag- 
netic Resonance Imaging), to variations in energy metabolism (involving, among oth- 
ers, glucose and oxygen) of the corresponding local populations of neurons (n > 105), 
and above all, their synapses, within submillimetric functional domains of the cerebral 
cortex (Grinvald, Lieke, Frostig, Gilbert, & Wiesel, 1986). Adaptive changesmfor 
example, dilation and blood flow increase within local vasculature after energy de- 
mands in synapses have begunmare observed over a time period of few seconds: a 
similar phase shift is observed for rCBF after synaptic activities have returned to their 
initial level. 
8-1.2. Positron Emission Tomography" Progress and Limitations 
Not only is the intimate regulation of such adaptive vascular changes not well under- 
stood, but also techniques such as PET have general limitations in terms of spatial 
and temporal resolution that should not be overlooked. By comparison to SPECT or 
first generation PET techniques, the sensitivity of PET cameras have recently im- 
proved together with their spatial resolution (about 5 mm in 3 axes) (Townsend et al., 
1991; Bailey, Jones, Friston, Colebatch, & Frackowiak, 1991) so that it is currently 
possible (a) to coregister PET and morphological, millimetric MR images onto the 
same stereotaxic space and (b) to conduct analyses in individual subjects. This elim- 
inates the problems associated with intersubject anatomical and functional variability 
and the confounding effects of across-subjects averaging (as an example of a subject- 
based language activation study, see Herholz et al., 1996). These improvements also 
allow one to reduce the radiation dose administered for each PET measurement; the 
number of PET measurements that can be made in an individual is usually about 12 
in one pass. 
The temporal resolution of this technique, even considering recent improvements 
(Silbersweig et al., 1993, 1995), remains very poor (greater than 10s) compared to 
the typical time scale of cognitive processes (less than l s). Prolonged periods of data 
acquisition with PET imply major constraints on the design of language activation 
paradigms. Activation tasks must be designed so that the psycholinguistic processes 
induced by the task do not vary over the rCBF recording period (typically about 60s), 
and that habituation or automatization does not progressively appear, unless these 
phenomena are purposefully under consideration in the study. For instance, habituation 
may originate from tasks that are too easy (for a given subject) or by repetition of 
the same stimuli in the same scanning session. In general, tasks that are likely to keep 
subjects firmly attending, therefore, are preferable to so-called passive tasks in which 
subjects are asked to "only perceive" stimuli. Such a vague instruction actually means 
that the nature of the cognitive components of the task is just ignored and therefore 
makes the interpretation of any between-task differences in brain activity difficult a 
priori. Instead, the cognitive components that are involved in different experimental 
tasks should be defined as precisely as possible. Behavioral indices (such as response 
accuracy or reaction time) recorded during PET scanning also help to demonstrate 
that stimuli were actually processed by the subjects in a manner compatible with the 

134 
Jean-Francois D~monet 
theoretical assumptions underlying the task design (D6monet, Chollet et al., 1992). 
As a drawback of this methodological option, it follows that such activation language 
tasks require a strong attentional control, and are very artificial when compared with 
"natural" language processing. The interest of studies specifically devoted to more 
automatic modes of language processing should certainly not be overlooked (Price, 
Wise, & Frackowiak, 1996), and we shall see that automatic access to language rep- 
resentations may have an important role even in quite controlled experimental con- 
ditions. Moreover, investigations on "real" languagemthat is, continuous, discursive 
language samplesmis obviously the final goal of functional brain-imaging studies of 
human language (as examples of tentative approaches to the supralexical and discourse 
level of language processing, see D6monet, Celsis et al., 1992; Kawashima et al., 
1993; Mazoyer et al., 1993; Bottini et al., 1994). However, even at the discourse level, 
precisely controlled activation tasks seem still needed before moving on to more "ec- 
ological" experimental conditions. 
8-1.3. Functional Magnetic Resonance: An Imaging Technique Faster 
Than PET but with Some Drawbacks as Well 
Nonisotopic tomographic functional imaging, that is, fMRI, does not use radioactive 
compounds and has a better time resolution than PET (although fMRI time scale still 
is poorer than that of electrophysiological techniques). For the time being, it seems 
that fMRI complements rather than substitutes for PET in brain-mapping studies. 
Indeed, even though increasingly sophisticated fMRI studies (using high-field mag- 
nets) have appeared in the literature, this method also has its drawbacks, such as 
spurious signal changes related to various factors, namely, head motion (even milli- 
meters in amplitude), heart and respiratory rates, and so on. The sensitivity of the 
method vis-a-vis cognition-related neural activities, together with its ability to explore, 
in a one-pass fashion, the entire brain volume, still appear inferior to those of the 
most recent PET equipment. The key advantage of fMRI compared to PET is rather 
the number of separate measurements of functionally significant signals that can be 
achieved in a short period of time. The most widely used method, the Blood Oxy- 
genation Level-Dependent (BOLD) effect (Ogawa, Lee, Kay, & Tank, 1990), is based 
on the paramagnetic properties of DeOxyHemoglobine and takes advantage of the fact 
that the local vascular response to "energy demands" of neurons typically exceeds 
cellular needs (Fox & Raichle, 1986), and consequently induces local decreases in the 
blood concentration of DeOxyHemoglobine (even though its metabolic rate actually 
increases due to energy consumption in the nearby synapses). It follows that the 
observed fMRI BOLD signals actually increase in an activated region (i.e., a region 
with increased synaptic firing). 
Using the fast echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition technique (Mansfield, 1977) 
and the BOLD method, the main part of the cortical "language area" (about 10 axial 
slices 5mm thick) can typically be scanned in 1.4s (less than 0.14s per slice); this is 
repeated many times in a scanning session for one subject (e.g., 80 repetitions per 

8 
Brain Imaging of Language Functions 
135 
session). Multiple acquisitions therefore may be used to analyze several behavioral 
changes in one subject over a single session. In general, binary alternations of "rest- 
ing" and "active" conditions are used that last about 10s or more and involve several 
acquisitions (and stimuli) (e.g., 10 acquisitions per condition). 
These alternations are in fact considered as the entry function (main frequency of 
about 0.05 Hz or less) that can be related to the observed signal changes; fMRI signal 
processing thus relies on correlational methods showing voxels (elementary volume 
units of the image matrix) in the explored brain volume whose value "oscillates" 
with similar frequencies (Bandettini, Wong, Hinks, Tikofsky, & Hyde, 1992). These 
voxels are thought to reflect local neural responses to experimental behavioral changes. 
The correlational approach (see section 8-2.2. on the correlational method) permits 
one to compensate for the strong background noise of fMRI signals (not to mention 
the strong acoustic noise produced by the machine) and their relatively small signal-to- 
noise ratio (especially using routine, 1.5 Tesla MRI machines) that considerably lower 
the statistical power of the classical, subtractive across-task comparisons (e.g., t tests 
between signal amplitudes, averaged over blocked conditions, namely, statistics on 
stimulation minus rest comparisons). 
However, acquisition speed using the EPI acquisition mode also has its drawback, 
as it tends to reduce the spatial resolution of functional MR images compared to that 
of morphological MR images. Finally, it should be noted that the most sensitive fMRI 
methods are those using high-field permanent magnets (e.g., 3 or 4 Tesla, which is 
about 3 or 4 times 10 a greater than the earth's magnetic field) that (a) are expensive 
machines only available in few research centers, and (b) may cause biological side 
effects that have not yet been fully investigated. 
The reader may find additional information on techniques in two recent contribu- 
tions (Bandettini & Wong, in press; Toga & Mazziotta, 1996). 
8-2. THE ACTIVATION 
PARADIGM 
IN NORMAL 
SUBJECTS 
There are several ways to use functional brain imaging to expand our knowledge 
beyond the limits of the classical lesion-based model. The principal one is to address 
whether the regions related to impairments of specific language functions when dam- 
aged might be activated in normal subjects exhibiting the same functions while they 
undergo a particular language task. 
For instance, several authors, such as Geschwind (1965), Heilman, Rothi, Mc- 
Farling, & Rottmann (1981), and Cappa, Cavalotti, & Vignolo (1981), claimed that 
phonological disorders are associated with lesions close to the left sylvian fissure 
whereas lexical semantic disorders are linked to lesions of regions that are more distant 
from the fissure, such as the inferior parts of the parietal or temporal lobes. In several 
PET activation studies, D6monet and his colleagues (D6monet, Chollet, et al., 1992; 
D6monet, Price, Wise, & Frackowiak, 1994a; D6monet, Price, Wise, & Frackowiak 

136 
Jean-Francois D~monet 
1994b) addressed the question whether such a topographical segregation between pho- 
nological and lexical semantic processes might be observed in normal subjects when 
comparing brain activation induced by two language tasks. Each task crucially de- 
pended on one of these two processes, the other process being less important. The 
results were based on "subtractive" comparisons between the two activation tasks 
(see Figure 1). In a given comparison, significant local increases of blood flow were 
computed that corresponded to one task against the other, which was considered as 
reference. The results proved to be in good accord with previous observations on 
aphasic symptoms and the topography of the corresponding lesions. However, a sat- 
isfactory convergence was not observed in all activation studies (nor between them) 
over the past few years, thus suggesting difficulties in using such simple across-task 
subtractions. 
8-2.1. Limitations of the Subtraction Method 
Many recent PET language-related activation studies now provide a large amount of 
data on the functional anatomy of language, mainly based on the "subtractive" method 
(Petersen, Fox, Posner, Mintun, & Raichle, 1988; Posner, Petersen, Fox, & Raichle, 
1988; Petersen, Fox, Posner, Mintun, & Raichle, 1989; Petersen, Fox, Snyder, & 
Raichle, 1990; Wise et al., 1991; D6monet, Chollet, et al., 1992; Howard et al., 1992; 
Sakurai et al., 1992; Sergent, Ohta, & Mac Donald, 1992; Sergent, Zuck, Levesque, 
& Mac Donald, 1992; Zatorre, Evans, Meyer, & Gjedde, 1992; Mazoyer et al., 1993; 
Paulesu, Frith, & Frackowiak, 1993; Sakurai et al., 1993; Bottini et al., 1994; D6monet 
et al., 1994a, 1994b; Price et al., 1994; Price, Moore, & Frackowiak, 1996; Price, 
Wise, & Frackowiak, 1996; Raichle et al., 1994; Buckner, Raichle, & Petersen, 1995; 
Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio, 1996; Fiez et al., 1995; Fiez, 
Raichle, Balota, Tallal, & Petersen, 1996; Herholz et al., 1996; Martin, Wiggs, 
Ungerleider, & Haxby, 1996; Price, Moore, & Frackowiak, 1996; Price, Wise, & 
Frackowiak, 1996; Warburton et al., 1996; Zatorre, Meyer, Gjedde, & Evans, 1996). 
Despite their interest and richness, these data have proved to be increasingly difficult 
to interpret; and sometimes they are contradictory. Such discrepancies have different 
origins. They partly relate to various, and often subtle, alterations of some experi- 
FIGURE 1 
Statistical maps showing, on transparent views of a standardized brain, areas of significant 
blood flow increases (p < .001, after corrections for multiple comparisons) in a lexical semantic task when 
a phonological task is taken as baseline (top) and vice versa (bottom). These tasks both consisted in 
monitoring targets among heard stimuli that were adjective-noun pairs in the lexical semantic task and 
polysyllabic (consonant-vowel) non-words in the phonological task. Lexical semantic processes induced 
predominant activation in the left middle temporal and inferior parietal regions (probably organized in a 
complex network involving also left prefrontal, posterior cingulate and right temporo-parietal regions). 
Phonological processes resulted in enhancement of activities in a more restricted left-sided network local- 
ized in the banks of the left sylvian fissure (see D6monet et al., 1994b for details). These features are in 
good accord with predictions drawn from studies of lesional localization in aphasia.

mental aspects of the activation procedure that may have a major impact on the results. 
Two examples of these seemingly "secondary" factors that are actually crucial de- 
terminants of brain activation (for a review, see D6monet, 1995) will be discussed 
here as their influences have recently been investigated in detail. 
The first one relates to conditions of stimulation such as rate of presentation and 
exposure duration of stimuli, systematically explored by Price et al. in a series of 
papers (1992, 1994, 1996). In their first study, these authors described a linear rela- 
tionship between rate of auditory stimulation (listening to words) and amount of ac- 
tivation in the primary auditory cortices, whereas the rCBF response was unaffected 
by the rate in the left association auditory cortex (Wernicke's area). Further, complex 
interactions were described in reading tasks between presentation rate, exposure du- 
ration, explicit instructions, and implicit processes involved in the tasks. 
Another very important factor is related to the degree of familiarity with the task. 
Raichle et al. (1994) described dramatic changes in rCBF activation when comparing 
verb generation in naive subjects and after the task had been overlearned and autom- 
atized in these subjects. 
Apart from these complex, and largely unexpected, experimental factors influencing 
the results of language activation studies, the major source of difficulty in summarizing 
the available activation data and accounting for discrepancies originates from the sub- 
tractive method itself when applied to complex cognitive processes such as language 
functions. In its most simplistic version, across-task subtraction implies that its net 
result will isolate the brain correlate of a particular language component as this is 
thought to be "present" in the "experimental" task and "absent" in the reference 
task. Although seemingly straightforward, such simple comparisons cannot account 
for language-related functional changes for two main reasons related to the relevant 
neural and cognitive architectures, respectively. 
First, the neural correlates of language functions seem to be widely distributed over 
large portions of the brain, and therefore are not likely to be anatomically restricted 
to a single (or even small sets of) activation peak(s). However, to reduce the number 
of false positives, statistical analysis most frequently consists in thresholding the peaks 
of rCBF changes at their very top, corresponding to very low p values (Bailey et al., 
1991). Conservative statistics applied to reduce the alpha risk may therefore overlook 
functionally significant activation signals corresponding to lower and more widespread 
rCBF changes (Poline & Mazoyer, 1993), especially when dealing with cognition- 
related activations in association cortices. 
Second, because of the fundamental parallelism of language processes and because 
any language task will automatically engage many of these processes (perhaps to 
various degrees of intensity), a single subtractive comparison can hardly isolate a given 
language component or function. Rather, only the combination of several comparisons 
can allow for a relative isolation of such a component, taking into account not only 
blood flow increases but also decreases (for a discussion of the functional significance 
of blood flow decreases, see D6monet, 1995; Wenzel et al., 1996) between, for in- 
stance, an "experimental" active condition (supposed to especially involve the cog- 
nitive component under study), "reference" active condition(s) (in which this corn- 

8 
Brain Imaging of Language Functions 
139 
ponent is less active, rather than totally absent), and a "resting" condition (whatever 
"rest" might mean in a living brain) (for further discussion of such technical issues, 
see D6monet, 1995; D6monet, Fiez, Paulesu, Petersen, & Zatorre, 1996). 
8-2.2. The Correlational Approach to Brain Activation and Its 
Implication in fMRI Studies 
Alternative approaches exist that can bypass some of the shortcomings of the "sub- 
tractive" method. The correlational method for exploring functional anatomy in the 
brain has been proposed for several years (e.g., Horwitz, Duara, & Rappoport, 1984; 
Metter, Riege, Kuhl, & Phelps, 1984; Moeller, Struther, Sidtis, & Rottenberg, 1987) 
but has been applied only in a few cognitive activation experiments using PET (Bart- 
lett, Brown, Wolf, & Brodie, 1987; Frith, Friston, Liddle, & Frackowiak, 1991; Hor- 
witz et al., 1993) and non-PET techniques (Goldenberg, Podreka, Steiner, & Willmes, 
1987; D6monet, Celsis, et al., 1992; Lagr~ze, Hartmann, Anzinger, Schaub, & Deister, 
1993). 
Linear correlations can be studied in an across-subject within-task design or vice 
versa. In an across-task correlational design, Frith et al. (1991) demonstrated that this 
method provides interesting findings that complement the results obtained by subtrac- 
tion. In a verbal fluency task compared to a lexical decision task, these authors ob- 
served significant decreases in the superior temporal regions, whereas increases were 
found in the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. The correlational analysis showed that 
the focus of rCBF increase in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex was negatively cor- 
related with the superior temporal region, thus suggesting the existence of a functional 
link between these two areas, with a possible inhibitory influence of the dorso-lateral 
prefrontal cortex on the superior temporal cortex. 
Friston, Frith, Liddle, & Frackowiak (1993) stressed, from a theoretical point of 
view, the interest of correlational methods to study brain functional connectivity, that 
is, functional networks such as those supporting language functions. Most important, 
they mentioned that these methods might be a useful formal tool to describe functional 
data acquired by different techniques (e.g., PET, functional MRI, and electrophysiol- 
ogy) using different time scales. They described a nonlinear, nondirected (i.e., not 
referring to any particular focus of "activation") correlational method using principal 
component analysis that was applied, as an illustration, to an activation experiment 
on an orthographic verbal fluency task, compared to a phoneme repetition task. This 
study identified two factors accounting for a large portion of the observed variance 
of rCBE corresponding, respectively, to two functionally independent sets of distrib- 
uted brain components. Whereas the second factor probably related to practice effects 
over the series of 12 PET scans, the first one was identified as an "intentional" system 
that corresponded to the verbal fluency task and involved the left dorso-lateral pre- 
frontal cortex, Broca's area, the thalami, and the cerebellum. Interestingly, the two 
subcortical regions were not found to be activated in previous similar studies con- 
ducted in the same laboratory but analyzed in a classical, subtractive way. This method 
seems a powerful method to assess the brain activation as it concerns signal changes 

140 
Jean-Francois D~monet 
in a series of measurements over which the influence of not only categorical but also 
graded variables (e.g., psychophysical variables such as rate of stimulation, exposure 
duration of stimuli, or even psycholinguistic variables such as lexicality, imageability 
of words, and so forth) can be explored. One limitation of this method using PET, 
however, is that the number of repeated measurements can hardly be more than 12 
because of the radiation dose that can be safely administered to subjects. 
This drawback does not exist with fMRI in which the number of repeated meas- 
urements only depends on the length of time that subjects agree to stay in the machine. 
Some fMRI studies were oriented to clinical applications (Desmond et al., 1995; 
Cuenod et al., 1995); language-related fMRI experiments have mainly consisted so 
far of replications of previous PET studies using the same experimental designs such 
as fluency tasks and across-task subtractions. For instance, McCarthy, Blamire, Roth- 
man, Gruetter, & Shulman (1993) focused on activation in the left inferior prefrontal 
cortex during a verb-generation task and supported Petersen et al.'s (1988) results 
regarding this region. Binder et al. (1995) and Shaywitz, et al. (1995), exploring lexical 
semantic and phonological tasks, respectively, confirmed a series of previous PET 
findings (e.g., Ddmonet, Chollet, et al., 1992; D6monet et al., 1994a). We have also 
partly confirmed our PET results, using the same activation paradigm with fMRI 
equipment (Berry et al., 1995) and the same applies to a tentative replication of 
previous PET results on brain correlates of verbal working memory by Paulesu et al. 
(1993) and Paulesu et al. (1995). 
As already mentioned, the correlational method applied to fMRI takes advantage 
of the great number of repeated measures provided by the technique. Correlations are 
therefore studied between the time series of recorded signals and various external, 
behavioral variables that can be used to modelize an input function, for example, an 
alternation between stimulated and unstimulated states that is thought to be reflected 
in observed fluctuations of fMRI signals. Interest in this method has been stressed by 
Binder et al. (1994), who described activation signals in both superior temporal regions 
significantly correlated to various auditory language stimulation. However, the validity 
or usefulness of this type of analysis still remains to be explored in more sophisticated 
paradigms, involving three (or more) cognitive activation conditions; indeed, these 
conditions might interact in a complex way, and the modelization of such interactions 
as input function is likely to be far more complex than that of the binary paradigm 
used by Binder et al. (1994). 
8-3. IMAGING CORRELATES OF LANGUAGE 
FUNCTIONS IN DAMAGED BRAINS 
8-3.1. Resting State Studies 
Compared to activation experiments, these studies represent a more classic approach 
to the brain/language problem as they investigate metabolic abnormalities that are 
induced by lesions and are seen in functional images during prolonged measurements 
of regional brain metabolism (mostly using the FluoroDeoxyGlucose PET technique), 

8 
Brain Imaging of Language Functions 
141 
during which patients do not receive any particular stimulation and are therefore con- 
sidered to be in a "resting" condition. 
A fair number of glucose steady-state PET studies were done in the eighties, es- 
pecially in North America, with relatively small groups of patients (Metter et al., 1981; 
Metter et al., 1983; Metter et al., 1984; Metter, Hanson, et al., 1986; Metter, Jackson, 
et al., 1986). 
One of the major contributions of these studies was to demonstrate the existence 
of massive remote effects of lesions with metabolic depression occurring far away 
from the anatomical site of the actual lesion. The most striking example of these 
remote effects relates to the so-called subcortical aphasias in which hypometabolism 
in the ipsilateral cortex is very frequently observed (Baron et al., 1986). 
Some of these studies also reinforced previous findings that direct or indirect dam- 
age to a specific region such as the left posterior temporal cortex is a crucial factor 
for both aphasia type and prognosis (Karbe et al., 1989). 
Finally, some follow-up studies have been done (Cappa, et al., 1991) and some 
others are currently reported to be ongoing. However, these longitudinal data are still 
unclear, if not contradictory. In general, the functional significance of changes in brain 
metabolism observed at rest, remains to be clarified. For instance, remote hypome- 
tabolic effects may represent at least two different phenomena. On the one hand, the 
affected regions may be only de-afferented but still can participate in functional ac- 
tivation via other connections or networks. On the other hand, these hypometabolic 
regions, particularly when they lie not too far away from the morphological lesion, 
or within the same vascular territory, may be actually affected by neuronal loss, due 
to ischemic "penumbra," resulting in an irreversible loss of function. 
8-3.2. Activating Damaged Brains 
The shortcomings of resting state PET studies obviously lead one to explore the 
functionality of the undamaged parts of the brain by using activation tasks to test 
whether some spared territories could be involved when patients performed these 
tasks. In fact very little has been done so far using up-to-date methodological standards 
of PET activation that is high-resolution rCBF recordings using the Oxygen 15 tech- 
nique. 
Weiller et al. (1995) conducted one of these studies. They studied 6 Wernicke-type 
aphasic patients with retro-rolandic lesions and good recovery. By comparison to the 
activation observed in covert nonword-repetition and verb-generation tasks in normal 
subjects, aphasic subjects of course demonstrated no activation in the damaged region 
and increased, supranormal activations in the right hemisphere, both in the superior 
temporal and the inferior frontal regions on both tasks. 
Although appealing at first glance, this type of study soon appeared particularly 
complex because it combines two main sources of variance: one is related to brain 
lesions and aphasia, and their factors of complexity were briefly mentioned earlier in 
this chapter; the other comes from the many "secondary" experimental factors that 
may distort the results of cognitive activation even in normal subjects, as already 
addressed earlier. 

142 
Jean-Francois D6monet 
In general, such a complexity suggests that activation should only be explored using 
single-subject studies; this is possible today thanks to technical improvements in im- 
aging methods (see, for instance, Engelien et al., 1995). 
The major factor likely to affect brain activation in aphasic patients is obviously 
the lesion. In cases of massive tissue loss or impairment, a pervasive hypometabolic 
effect is frequently seen over the entire hemisphere, and a (poorly specific) functional 
activation restricted to the right hemisphere is in fact the only finding that one could 
possibly predict as a result of any stimulation. 
However, in cases of less massive lesions, the question can be raised whether such 
right-sided activations, together with left-sided ones among the spared territories, 
might represent neural activities specifically related to language functions and fur- 
thermore illustrate in some way the mechanisms of recovery and compensation fol- 
lowing brain lesion. 
Involvement of right-sided structures during language activation tasks has fre- 
quently been reported in the literature on activation in normal right-handed subjects. 
We described right temporal activations in our own studies using auditory compre- 
hension tasks (D6monet, Chollet, et al., 1992; D6monet et al., 1994a) and interpreted 
this finding as an automatic engagement of early acoustic-phonetic aspects of stimuli 
processing, as these signals tended to vanish in the most difficult, highly specific 
variants of our tasks. It could be speculated, however, that these right-sided foci of 
activation may represent potential substrates for compensatory mechanisms after 
left-sided lesions. 
In aphasic patients, available functional imaging data relevant to the question of 
mechanisms for compensation and recovery are too scarce at present to draw even a 
general sketch of such phenomena. 
To assess the specificity of activations observed in aphasic patients during language 
tasks and their relevance to functional compensation, further studies should obviously 
seek correlations between such imaging findings and behavioral changes. Moreover, 
it should be addressed whether, in follow-up studies, functional changes observed in 
undamaged brain regions (e.g., right temporal regions) may parallel specific language 
improvements (e.g., efficiency of lexical semantic decoding processes) over time. 
8-4. CONCLUSION 
Whatever the immense complexity of cognitive imaging studies in normal subjects or 
brain-damaged patients, functional imaging studies based on the single-subject ap- 
proach now offer the unique opportunity to design experiments specific to the ob- 
served cognitive disorders in a given aphasic patient (see, for instance, Cardebat et 
al., 1994). Although clearly very stringent, the methodological requirements that have 
been underscored in this chapter are thought to maximize the heuristic potential of 
advanced functional imaging studies and, last but not least, reconcile cognitive neu- 
ropsychology and functional neuroanatomy.

This chapter describes the basic principles and procedures used for recording 
minute changes in the magnetic field that are generated by neuronal aggregates 
in the context of an experimental task. This technique, magnetoencephalography 
(MEG), is entirely noninvasive and combines high temporal resolution with great 
accuracy in the localization of intracerebral events. The advantages and short- 
comings of the MEG technique as a tool for source localization are described. 
Moreover, the utility of MEG measurements in localizing the sources of activity 
associated with the subjects' engagement in a variety of linguistic tasks is criti- 
cally reviewed. These tasks included phonetic detection, sentence reading, se- 
mantic categorization of word pairs, and picture naming. An attempt is made 
throughout this chapter to identify the kinds of questions that MEG procedures 
are capable of addressing and those that MEG techniques are not in a position 
to address in a satisfactory way. 
In recent years we have witnessed the emergence of several new and impressive 
methods for studying neural function in the normal, living brain. Each of these meth-

ods measures a particular aspect of brain physiology, such as blood flow, consumption 
of oxygen or glucose, and intracellular currents within neurons. These techniques have 
demonstrated an unprecedented precision in localizing cerebral events within relatively 
small anatomical regions. The explosion of new data that followed the incorporation 
of imaging methods into neuropsychology led to the belief that functional images 
were capable of uncovering the brain mechanisms of language and thought. The term 
"mechanism" refers not only to a set of anatomical units that display a characteristic 
pattern of activity, but also to the algorithm or code that governs the distributed 
activity that produces a particular result. When this outcome entails recognizing a 
written word or a face, understanding the meaning of a sentence, solving a problem, 
and so on, then the algorithm is the neural analogue of what we call, by common 
agreement, a cognitive operation. 
This being the case, the expectation that any functional image, which under the 
best circumstances is simply an index of the relative degree of activation of large 
populations of neurons, will reveal operations or mechanisms of language and thought 
is rather unwarranted. On the other hand, it is entirely reasonable to expect that the 
functional imaging methods will be making unique contributions toward the achieve- 
ment of the distant goal of understanding such mechanisms. First of all, by virtue of 
their noninvasiveness, these methods allow us to appreciate the pattern of brain activity 
in experimental situations that afford a greater degree of ecological validity than those 
using invasive procedures. The functional images that we can now record, though they 
do not reveal mechanisms, do give us an outline, however fuzzy and incomplete, of 
functional systems that mediate, somehow, certain cognitive operations that, we hy- 
pothesize, are necessary for performing particular types of tasks. Finally, one could 
expect that, with the addition of information from other methodologies (for example, 
single-cell recordings, in vitro neurochemistry) regarding the mode of operation of 
smaller functional units and of their interconnections, it may become possible to 
achieve realistic descriptions of the mechanisms themselves. 
9-1. TECHNICAL 
ASPECTS 
OF 
MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY 
Traditionally, moment-to-moment variations in cerebral activity associated with a par- 
ticular experimental event were recorded noninvasively in the form of time-varying 
voltages sampled from the scalp surface, known as event-related potentials (ERPs). 
Although useful in certain respects, ERPs do not provide sufficient information for 
the precise localization of the sources of the observed voltages. To a great extent this 
problem is related to the fact that measurements of scalp-recorded electrical activity 
reflect both primary and secondary cerebral currents. The former are produced by 
postsynaptic neurochemical events in active neurons and correspond to intracellular 
currents. The latter correspond to extracellular currents that are passively conducted 
through the medium that surrounds their source (that is, the primary current) and they

are consequently affected by the inhomogeneities in the conductivity of the surround- 
ing tissues. A consequence of this is an irregular voltage distribution on the scalp that 
creates serious problems in the correct estimation of underlying sources. 
9-1.1. The MEG Recording System 
To some extent, these problem can be addressed with the use of magnetoencepha- 
lography (MEG), which entails recording minute changes in the magnetic fields gen- 
erated within the brain, time-locked to an external stimulus or event. These measure- 
ments are made entirely noninvasively with the use of the neuromagnetometer (Cohen, 
1972) an instrument sensitive to magnetic fields produced by activity in small cortical 
patches (Chapman, Ilmoniemi, Barbanera, & Romani, 1984). Neuromagnetic record- 
ings were made possible with the development of the superconducting device known 
as SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device). The SQUID is connected 
to a magnetic detection coil or magnetometer, both immersed in a liquid helium bath 
at temperatures near absolute zero. Magnetic fields that reach the surface of the scalp 
and pass through the detection coil produce small currents along the superconducting 
wire by induction. To reduce the relative contribution of environmental magnetic 
sources, various configurations of magnetic coils have been used. The most widely 
used device, known as gradiometer, consists of a detection coil placed near the scalp 
and one or more compensation coils wound in the direction opposite to the detection 
coil and placed further away from the scalp. The magnetic flux that passes through 
both sets of coils induces opposite currents that cancel each other out (see inset in 
Figure 1). This is true for magnetic fields generated at locations far from the sources 
of the signals of interest. In contrast, magnetic fields generated near the lower coil are 
more likely to induce detectable currents. The spatial separation of the two coils also 
determines the relative sensitivity of the magnetometer to near and far cerebral 
sources. Most commercially available systems are primarily sensitive to superficial 
sources, but they can also detect strong subcortical sources. For reasons that are be- 
yond the scope of this chapter, deeper sources are associated with greater error in 
localization. 
The superconducting coils are oriented parallel to the surface of the scalp. There- 
fore, they are almost exclusively sensitive to the component of the magnetic field that 
is normal to the scalp. This component reflects primary cerebral currents generated 
by sources that are tangential to the scalp surface (see Figure 1). It appears that the 
primary current measured by MEG is generated in the apical segments of pyramidal 
cells, which are typically oriented perpendicular to the cortical layers and are arranged 
in vertical columns (Lewine, 1990). Pyramidal cells located on the walls of cortical 
sulci are tangentially oriented relative to the scalp surface and in a position to make 
a strong contribution to the magnetic field normal to the scalp recordable by the 
neuromagnetometer. In contrast, the magnetic flux produced by radial sources is tan- 
gential to the scalp surface and therefore is not detectable by the magnetometer. To 
further improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnetic recordings, several MEG 
records are obtained in response to repeated presentations of the experimental event

gradiometer. The distance between the lower and the higher coils (baseline) determines the relative sensi-

and averaged together. These records are known as evoked magnetic fields (EMFs). 
Averaging has been a standard procedure in ERP and MEG research designed to yield 
more reliable estimates of the underlying activity. The first MEG machines were ca- 
pable of recording EMFs from a small number of scalp locations simultaneously 
(usually one to seven locations). In order to cover the entire surface of the scalp, 
several successive placements of the recording device were necessary. This proce- 
dure relied on the assumption that the parameters of the sources of the magnetic ac- 
tivity of interest remain constant over time. However, variations in the subject's 
state, combined with habituation and practice effects, were likely to introduce con- 
siderable extraneous variability in the data. In more recent years, neuromagnetome- 
ters equipped with large detector arrays were developed that have the capacity to 
detect signals from 24 to 72 scalp locations simultaneously (for example, Gallen et 
al., 1994). Also, systems that have the capacity to record EMFs from the entire sur- 

9 
MEG and Language 
147 
face of the head simultaneously have been developed (Ahonen et al., 1993; Nakasato 
et al., 1996). 
9-1.2. Source Localization 
A key issue in the use of MEG to determine the sources of cerebral activation asso- 
ciated with a particular stimulus or task is constructing an adequate model of the 
underlying source(s). Thus far, most researchers have modeled the sources as single 
current dipoles in order to account for the distribution of magnetic field measured at 
the scalp surface. The problem of calculating the parameters of intracranial sources 
(that is, their spatial coordinates, strength, and orientation) from the distribution of 
magnetic flux measured from the scalp is known as the inverse problem. Unfortu- 
nately, the inverse problem does not have a unique solution because, in principle, 
there is an infinite number of source combinations that can produce the same magnetic 
flux pattern. If the characteristics of the source(s) were known, then one could cal- 
culate the magnetic flux generated by the source currents at a given distance from the 
source using the Biot-Savart law, which is expressed by the following equation: 
Bo = (~o Q sin0)\(4 -rr r2), where B is the magnetic field strength in units of Tesla, r is 
the distance between the source and the point of measurement in meters, Q the strength 
of the source in nanoAmpere.meters, and Ix is the magnetic permeability constant of 
free space that is the same for biological tissues. In practice, to address the problem 
of source localization, researchers start with a hypothetical set of dipole parameters 
and calculate the magnetic flux pattern that the dipole in question would produce. In 
other words, the first step in this procedure involves solving a forward problem. Then 
they use a least-squares algorithm to compare the actually recorded pattern with the 
one calculated from the hypothetical dipole parameters. If a good match is not found, 
the dipole parameters are iteratively modified and the forward problem is repeatedly 
solved until a satisfactory correspondence between the predicted and the observed 
magnetic flux pattern is achieved. A set of computed dipole parameters is accepted 
only when the correlation between predicted and observed magnetic fields exceeds a 
preset criterion value, which ranges between .85 and .95 across studies. 
To further ensure that a given solution to the inverse problem is valid, source 
localization data are compared, whenever possible, with information obtained from 
other research paradigms, such as lesion studies, intracranial recordings in epileptic 
patients, and other functional neuroimaging techniques. When these precautions are 
taken, the technical limitations of the MEG method do not pose serious restrictions 
on its source localization capacity. The validity of source localization techniques based 
on MEG data has been affirmed in several investigations of the intracranial sources 
of activity associated with sensory stimulation (for example, Pantev et al., 1988; Pa- 
panicolaou, Rogers, Baumann, Saydjari, & Eisenberg, 1990; Romani, Williamson, & 
Kaufman, 1982). In these studies the estimated sources of the magnetic equivalent of 
early ERP components such as the N 100 response (known as the N 100m component) 
elicited by simple sounds were localized in the vicinity of the primary auditory cortex 
in accordance with knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the auditory system. 

148 
Andrew C. Papanicolaou et al. 
Subsequent studies examined the magnetic correlates of components that are presum- 
ably associated with engagement in specific tasks (such as the P300 response; Rogers 
et al., 1991; Rogers, Basile, Papanicolaou, & Eisenberg, 1993). In general, there was 
close agreement between the anatomical locations of estimated dipolar sources of these 
components and data from human lesion studies (Johnson, 1989; Knight, Scabini, 
Woods, & Clayworth, 1989), and from intracranial recordings (McCarthy, Wood, Wil- 
liamson, & Spencer, 1989). 
9-1.3. MEG versus Other Imaging Techniques 
The MEG has a number of advantages compared to other widely used imaging tech- 
niques such as PET, SPECT, rCBE and fMRI. First, its temporal resolution is several 
orders of magnitude higher than any of these methods. Second, MEG is entirely 
noninvasive, whereas PET, SPECT, and rCBF require inhalation or injection of ra- 
dioactive tracers. Third, the MEG data do not depend on the assumption of linear 
additivity of brain activity due to different cognitive operations. This assumption pro- 
vides the rationale for implementing the subtraction method, which is a necessary step 
in all PET and SPECT studies and in many fMRI applications. Finally, MEG is 
believed to provide a direct measure of primary electrical currents that result from 
local changes in neuronal transmission. Therefore, MEG findings can be more directly 
related to changes in local brain activity associated with a particular experimental 
event or tasks. Cerebral metabolism or cerebral blood flow data, on the other hand, 
can only serve as indirect measures of primary neurophysiological events. 
Another advantage of MEG is that it can yield data that are meaningful at the 
single-subject level, that is, without requiring group averaging, which is often nec- 
essary in similar PET and fMRI applications. In this way, MEG is more readily 
applicable in the detection of individual differences than other imaging methods. Such 
differences have been reported in the precise location of dipoles (for example, Simos, 
Basile, & Papanicolaou, in press), in the morphology of EMF waveforms (for example, 
Basile, Simos, Tarkka, Brunder, & Papanicolou, 1996), and in the temporal course 
and the laterality profiles of estimated sources of activity (Salmelin, Hari, Lounasmaa, 
& Sams, 1994). Among the potential sources of variation that could account for dif- 
ferences in source localization are the following: (a) variability in the functional or- 
ganization of cortical areas (for example, Ojemann, Ojemann, Lettich, & Berger, 
1989); (b) anatomical variability leading to differences in the geometry of the cortical 
regions that contribute to the scalp-recorded magnetic fields during a given task (Stein- 
metz & Seitz, 1991); and (c) individual differences in the prominent cognitive strategy 
(-ies) employed by each subject for performing the experimental task (for example, 
Cohen & Freeman, 1978). Differences in waveform morphology might be better un- 
derstood in light of the possibility that the externally recorded magnetic fields receive 
contributions from subpopulations of cells that show distinct temporal firing patterns 
(for instance, "tonic" versus "phasic" cells: Fuster, 1989; Watanabe, 1990). It is 
possible that under conditions that are not currently understood, the relative contri- 
bution from each subpopulation to the EMFs varies across subjects producing distinct 
temporal patterns in their averaged waveforms.

9-1.4. Summary 
To summarize, evoked magnetic fields reflect primarily changes in intracellular elec- 
trical currents time-locked to external events. A standard practice has been to model 
the intracranial sources of EMFs as equivalent current dipoles that can be defined in 
terms of spatial coordinates, strength, and orientation. Dipole parameters are esti- 
mated from the best solution to the inverse problem. Although the solutions to the 
inverse problem are not unique, the capacity of the MEG method to localize sources 
within anatomically plausible cerebral regions has been validated in several MEG 
studies. 
9-2. APPLICATIONS 
OF 
MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY 
TO THE 
STUDY 
OF LANGUAGE 
The search for electrophysiological correlates of language has received much attention 
over the last three decades. Guiding that search was the notion that the ability to 
perceive speech depended on certain "mechanisms" that were language-specific (that 
is, specific to speech sounds and specially evolved for language; for example, Eimas, 
1975; Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, & Studdert-Kennedy, 1967). In addition, it was 
assumed that the special status of language was somehow related to the asymmetric 
capacity of the two cerebral hemispheres to perform linguistic tasks (for example, 
Lenneberg, 1967). It seemed natural, then, to ERP researchers to search for parameters 
in the ERP signal that would be specific to language stimuli and, at the same time, 
be asymmetrically distributed across the two hemispheres. These early attempts had 
focused on comparisons between speech (for example, consonant-vowel syllables, 
words) and nonspeech sounds (such as tones) (for example, Molfese, Freeman, & 
Palermo, 1975; Morrell & Salamy, 1971). However, apart from failing to produce 
replicable results (for example, Grabow, Aronson, Rose, & Greene, 1980), such studies 
failed to take into account important acoustic parameters that distinguished the two 
classes of sounds. Consequently, the occasional positive findings could not be directly 
related to the hypothetical operations used by the auditory system to encode speech. 
9-2.1. EMFs in Response to Speech and Nonspeech Stimuli 
With the advent of the MEG method, researchers sought to explore its superior per- 
formance in source localization, in searching for stimulus-specific changes in activity 
generated within the human auditory cortex. It was anticipated that the new method 
would not only permit the detection of hemispheric asymmetries, but it would also 
allow for the within-hemisphere differentiation of sources that might display stimulus- 
specific activity. Unfortunately, most of the published MEG reports to date have not 
escaped from the same pitfalls that characterized the early ERP research. Most of 
these studies attempted comparisons between the magnetic responses elicited by 

150 
Andrew C. Papanicolaou et al. 
speech and nonspeech sounds (Kaukoranta, Hari, & Lounasmaa, 1987; Eulitz, Diesch, 
Pantev, Hampson, & Elbert, 1995). In the most recent of these investigations, Eulitz 
et al. (1995) presented series of synthesized vowel sounds randomly intermixed with 
pure tones. The subjects' task was to count the occurrences of the vowel/~e/. The 
EMFs that were recorded from 11 right-handed adults were characterized by an early 
deflection that peaked at the same latency as the electrical N 100 response (that is, the 
N100m peaking at approximately 100 ms poststimulus onset) and was followed by a 
sustained field (SF) that lasted for a few hundred milliseconds. The sources of both 
components were localized in the vicinity of the auditory cortex. A notable finding 
was that the amplitude of the SE as well as the strength of its estimated dipole source, 
was larger for vowels than for tones, and that this difference was significant only in 
the measurements made over the left hemisphere (LH). Although the possibility exists 
that the observed interaction was due to hemispheric asymmetries in the distribution 
of speech-related sources of activity, as the authors claimed, the data are open to a 
number of alternative interpretations because the two types of stimuli differed in many 
important aspects besides the verbal/nonverbal dimension. These included acoustic 
properties (such as the number of spectral components and their bandwidth) and the 
amount of attention that the subjects were likely to devote to each class: tones were 
always task-irrelevant stimuli. 
Magnetoencephalographic correlates of consonant sound discrimination were in- 
vestigated by Aulanko and associates, who presented series of consonant-vowel (CV) 
syllables that were perceived as either a/be/or a/ga~/in a phonetic discrimination 
task (Aulanko, Hari, Lounasmaa, N~i~it~inen, & Sams, 1993). The relative frequency 
of occurrence of the two CVs was 20 and 80% in one block of trials and was reversed 
in the other block. In order to introduce an additional acoustic dimension, the fun- 
damental frequency (f0) of each CV was varied randomly within blocks. The strength 
of the N 100m deflection of the EMF was larger for infrequent than for frequent (that 
is, "standard") tokens, an effect that was identified with the magnetic equivalent of 
the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) known as the Mismatch Field (MMF). 1 The authors 
concluded that this effect reflected the detection of a phonetically relevant acoustic 
difference between the two CVs (that is, the direction of the second formant transi- 
tion), while they remained unaffected by the task-irrelevant changes in fundamental 
frequency. The MMF effect was preserved when subjects were instructed to ignore 
the stimuli and read a text instead. However, based on these data, one cannot conclude 
that changes in f0 had no effect on the amplitude of the MME because this variable 
was not included in the analyses. Therefore, the reported findings simply indicate the 
sensitivity of the MMF to a particular acoustic dimension (that is, the direction of the 
second formant transition) without permitting any conclusions regarding the relation 
between the activity in the auditory cortex indexed by the MMF and the ability to 
1The MMN effect refers to a change in the amplitude of the early portion of the ERP elicited 
by a physically deviant auditory stimulus that is embedded in a series of similar or standard stimuli 
(N~i~it~inen, Simson, & Loveless, 1982). The MMN does not require the subject to be engaged in 
an active discrimination task. 

9 
MEG and Language 
151 
perform phonetic distinctions based on this acoustic cue. Indeed, the MMF appears 
to be sensitive to the direction of frequency modulation in nonspeech contexts as well 
(Pardo & Sams, 1993). Once again it will be emphasized that the selection of stimuli 
in these investigations did not permit a separation between the contribution of acoustic 
and linguistic variables to the observed EMF patterns. 
9-2.2. EMFs in Response to Complex Linguistic Tasks 
Another study attempted to examine asymmetries in brain activity associated with 
engagement in a task that presumably involved higher levels of linguistic analysis: a 
semantic-category detection task with auditorily presented words as stimuli (Hari et 
al., 1989). The EMF waveforms on both sides of the scalp were characterized by the 
N100m deflection that was followed by a sustained field that reached maximum am- 
plitude between 400 and 500 ms after stimulus onset. Dipole sources estimated at the 
peak of the sustained field were located more posterior in the LH than corresponding 
sources found in the right hemisphere. Since individual MRI scans were not available, 
these comparisons were based on the absolute coordinates of the respective dipole 
sources. Once again, the relevance of these differences to language-specific neural 
processes could not be ascertained on the basis of the available data. 
9-2.2.1. Source Identification Guided by Waveform Morphology: 
The N400m 
One way to address this problem is to examine components of event-related brain 
activity whose sensitivity to linguistic parameters has been empirically established in 
previous research. One such component is the N400, which has been repeatedly shown 
to respond to semantic anomalies in visual (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980a, 1980b) and 
auditory sentence-reading paradigms (McCallum, Farmer, & Pockock, 1984). The am- 
plitude of the N400 response is believed to be an index of the degree that a potentially 
meaningful stimulus is perceived as being "appropriate" within a particular linguistic 
context (Kutas & Van Petten, 1988). Therefore, identifying the intracranial sources of 
the scalp-recorded N400 deflection might reveal some of the brain areas that partici- 
pate in the evaluation of contextual congruity. A preliminary attempt to record the 
magnetic equivalent of the N400 (N400m) in the standard sentence-reading paradigm 
was successful (Schmidt, Arthur, Kutas, & Flynn, 1989). However, because of a num- 
ber of methodological limitations (such as the lack of individual MRI scans, and the 
small number of subjects and MEG recording locations), the study did not succeed in 
providing conclusive source localization information. In order to provide a clearer 
picture of the N400m sources, we undertook a more systematic investigation using 
the same sentence-reading task (Simos et al., in press). The subjects were instructed 
to read sentences that had highly predictable endings and were presented one word 
at a time (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980a, 1980b, 1984; Polich, 1985). They were asked 
to focus on sentence meaning, without making any explicit decision on the pre- 
sented stimuli. Half of the sentences ended with a semantically inappropriate--but 

152 
Andrew C. Papanicolaou et al. 
grammatically and syntactically appropriate--word that typically elicits a reliable elec- 
trical N400 response. 
Neuromagnetic measurements were obtained from 49 locations covering the left 
side 2 of the scalp with a 7-channel neuromagnetometer, in eight right-handed adults. 
The ERP data showed clear N400 responses in every subject (Figure 2A), that were 
significantly larger in amplitude in the Incongruous condition compared to the Con- 
gruous condition, in agreement with the existing ERP literature. Satisfactory solutions 
to the inverse problem of dipole fitting were obtained from seven subjects in the 
Incongruous condition at several contiguous time points around the latency of the 
N400 peak. As expected, the N400m response elicited by incongruous endings was 
larger in field strength as well as in the strength of its estimated dipole source com- 
pared to the response elicited by congruous endings (see Figure 2B & 2C). In every 
case N400m sources were localized in temporal lobe structures, including neocortical 
areas on the lateral surface of the left hemisphere (that is, near the temporo-parietal 
junction, and in the middle temporal gyrus), and medial temporal paleo- and archeo- 
cortical regions, that is, in the vicinity of the hippocampus and the parahippocampal 
gyrus. 
In one subject (S#5), dipole regions extended more posteriorly into the lateral 
temporo-occipital association cortex (Brodmann's area 37). 
The anatomical locus of estimated sources could be accounted for on the basis of 
knowledge regarding the possible role of these cortical areas in relation to the char- 
acteristics of our task. Specifically, several lesion studies have established a link be- 
tween the left temporo-parietal cortex and word recognition (Damasio & Damasio, 
1983; Greenblatt, 1973). Moreover, data from lesion and PET studies suggest that 
certain middle temporal regions are involved in reading and semantic comprehension 
of written material (Hart & Gordon, 1990; Howard et al., 1992; Price et al., 1994). 
Finally, activity in more medial aspects of the temporal lobe synchronous with the 
scalp-recorded N400 response has been verified using intracranial recordings in epi- 
leptic patients (McCarthy, Nobre, Bentin, & Spencer, 1995; Smith, Stapleton, & Hal- 
gren, 1986). Activity in these structures may be related to the presumed role of the 
hippocampus in recent memory (Squire, 1986; Damasio & Damasio, 1989, p. 39). 
The latter is an important component of processes that contribute to word recognition 
(such as contextual integration and subjective expectancy). 
9-2.2.2. Source Identification Guided by Variables Other Than 
Waveform Morphology 
Although the approach to source identification that focuses on particular ERP/EMF 
components may prove useful in addressing certain issues in neurolinguistics, it relies 
heavily on the assumption that the components under investigation reflect operations 
2Data from earlier reports (Schmidt et al., 1989; Smith Stapleton, & Halgren, 1986) and our 
own preliminary data did not warrant systematic examination of magnetic fields on the right side 
of the head. This issue, however, requires further investigation.

that are specific to languageman assumption that may not be entirely justifiable. More- 
over, it is possible that by using this strategy important information regarding the 
spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity may be lost. One way to address these 
problems is to follow a source identification approach that is not guided by waveform 
morphology. Initially, the studies that adopted this strategy examined whether partic- 
ular tasks could activate reliably anatomical regions that are knownmfrom other 
sources~to be involved in the execution of these tasks. 
For instance, Salmelin and associates sought to identify the cortical areas that be- 
come active as subjects attempt to attach verbal labels to a series of common objects 
(Salmelin et al., 1994). Magnetic fields were recorded from six right-handed adults in 
a picture-naming task using a whole-head (122-channel) magnetometer. A prominent 
finding was that the estimated dipole sources were almost exclusively located in 
temporo-parietal and occipital cortices during the first 400 ms after stimulus onset. In 
some cases, during the second half of this period sources were also localized more 
anteriorly, in superior temporal regions, possibly in the vicinity of Wernicke's area. 
During the next 200 ms period, dipoles were found exclusively in peri-Sylvian areas 
including temporal and frontal regions. The observed spatiotemporal pattern of activity 
was in general agreement with the Wernicke-Geschwind model (Geschwind, 1965). 
This model predicts that during object naming cortical engagement proceeds from 
posterior "visual" to anterior "speech" areas. A clear laterality profile was not ap- 
parent in the data, a finding that was in sharp contrast with reports from studies using 
invasive methods (such as the Wada test), which often indicate that the performance 
of naming tasks depends largely on left hemisphere structures (for example, Loring 
et al., 1990). Despite this discrepancy, which could be partially accounted for by the 
large amount of intersubject variability that was present in the data, this study was 
important because it demonstrated the capacity of MEG to reveal the time course of 
cerebral activation associated with a particular task, a quality unmatched by any other 
imaging technique to date. 
A slightly different approach to functional imaging using MEG is to search for 
indices of regional specialization within a particular area of the brain. Previous find- 
ings had suggested that distinct regions of the frontal cortex are involved in the prep- 
aration and execution of different nonverbal tasks (Basile, Rogers, Bourbon, & Pa- 
panicolaou, 1994). In a more recent study, we extended these findings with the use 
of a semantic categorization task (Basile et al., 1996). This study was designed to test 
the prediction that consistent sources of magnetic activity can be found in the left, 
but not in the right, prefrontal cortex as right-handed subjects become engaged even 
in a simple verbal task. A semantic categorization task was used, in which the subjects 
were asked to decide whether a pair of printed words, which were presented in suc- 
cession on each trial, belonged in the same category, and to keep a running count of 
the number of category matches. All six subjects showed clearly dipolar isofield maps 
(see Figure 3B) on the left side of the head, and in all cases the estimated sources 
were located in the left posterior frontal cortex in the vicinity of Brodmann's areas 6 
and 44 (Figure 3C).

These results were in agreement with accumulating evidence showing increased 
activation in postero-lateral frontal areas during a variety of language tasks (for ex- 
ample, Demb et al., 1995; Price et al., 1994). Dipolar magnetic field distributions were 
also observed on the right side in most subjects. However, the estimated sources of 
these fields were never localized in frontal regions. Rather, they corresponded to the 
magnetic equivalents of ERP responses (such as the N400/P300 complex) with sources 
located typically in temporal lobe regions (Rogers et al., 1991; Rogers et al., 1992; 
Rogers et al., 1993; Simos et al., 1996). A small-scale replication of the experiment 
with two of the subjects produced essentially identical results. 
Despite their consistency, the conclusions that can be drawn from these findings 
remain limited. Although one can argue with certainty that some aspect of the ver- 
bal task was associated with frontal lobe activity that was clearly lateralized, there 
is greater uncertainty regarding the implications of these results for current notions 
of the organization of language in the brain. Experiments that are now under way 
attempt to identify the specific components of the verbal task that were more 
closely associated with the frontal sources observed in this study (for instance, or- 
thographic, phonological, semantic encoding). Other experiments will examine the 
contribution of variables such as memory involvement (by manipulating stimulus 
set size and length of the interstimulus delay interval), complexity of the compari- 
son decision (by manipulating the number of task-relevant stimulus dimensions), 
and the type of task (for example, by comparing decisions on phonological simi- 
larity with decisions on the similarity between spatial patterns made of the same 
stimuli). 
9-2.3. Summary 
To summarize, the MEG studies reviewed in this section fall into two broad categories. 
Studies in the first category attempted to identify EMF parameters that could distin- 
guish speech from nonspeech stimuli. Their findings showed that the source para- 
meters of the magnetic fields did not differ dramatically as a function of stimulus 
type. Even when differences were observed, it was not clear, due to the choice of 
stimuli, if they were related to activity in neuronal aggregates specialized for the 
analysis of language stimuli. Studies in the second category examined the character- 
istics of magnetic fields elicited when subjects were engaged in complex linguistic 
tasks such as sentence reading and picture naming. The estimated sources of these 
fields became active several hundred milliseconds after stimulus onset and were gen- 
erally located in cortical regions that, on the basis of evidence from other sources, 
presumably play an important role in language-related operations. A second conclu- 
sion that emerges from these studies is that clear-cut functional hemisphere asym- 
metries are not invariably seen in linguistic tasks. When such asymmetries are present, 
they involve activity elicited during a limited portion of the EMF waveform and are 
restricted within certain brain regions.

9-3. CONCLUSIONS 
Magnetoencephalography, as a functional imaging technique, has certain unique fea- 
tures. It combines the very high temporal resolution offered by ERPs with the capacity 
to localize neurophysiological events generated within relatively small cerebral 
regions. In addition, it is suitable for studying individual differences in functional 
neuronal activity. Its spatial sensitivity is superb when mapping well-localized events, 
such as the activation of primary sensory cortices within the first 100-200 ms follow- 
ing the onset of a stimulus. A different situation emerges when researchers try to 
analyze the magnetic fields generated as subjects become engaged in complex lin- 
guistic tasks. When interpreting these MEG findings, it is important to remember that 
any observed dipolar field distribution reflects activity of extended cortical patches 
that become involved in the execution of distinct operations required for the execution 
of the task. The estimated location of the current dipole derived from the data could 
well represent the unevenly weighted center of the distribution of local currents that 
are oriented tangentially with respect to the surface of the head. In other words, the 
estimated dipole coordinates are bound to depend on the geometry of the cortical 
surface, which determines, in part, the distribution of local currents that can be re- 
corded from the scalp. To overcome these difficulties, new computational techniques 
are being developed that permit the modeling of intracranial EMF generators either 
as extended sources or as multiple simultaneously active current dipoles (for example, 
Eulitz et al., 1994). It is expected that in the future these approaches will provide 
more realistic descriptions of cortical activation during complex tasks. 
Despite its limitations, the MEG technique has proven its utility for identifying the 
sources of brain activity associated with the engagement in a variety of linguistic tasks 
with reasonable anatomical precision. Further, with their superb temporal resolution, 
MEG recordings can provide unique information on the time course of regional cor- 
tical involvement in a particular task. Finally, because MEG data are meaningful at 
the level of the individual subject, they may offer valuable information regarding the 
neurophysiological correlates of individual differences in the performance of various 
tasks. However, thus far the contribution of MEG findings to our understanding of 
the cerebral mechanisms of language has not entirely fulfilled the expectations trig- 
gered when this technique was first introduced. One reason for this apparent shortfall 
is that these expectations were not altogether reasonable: as has been stressed repeat- 
edly, functional images do not reveal the mechanisms of language. Unless researchers 
have a clear picture of the entire circuitry of the brain, the algorithm that governs the 
brain activity, which in turn mediates linguistic performance, such mechanisms will 
remain elusive. To this date, MEG, much like the other functional imaging methods, 
has been successful in corroborating a number of traditional conceptions regarding 
the anatomical substrates of language. This is an important achievement in that it 
establishes the worth of the method and enhances our confidence that its future ap- 
plication may result in the emergence of new concepts and more realistic models 
regarding the brain mechanisms of language.

Contributions from subcortical circuits to language functions are acknowledged 
but are often considered separately from the contributions of the cortex. Brain 
organization and the evidence from studies of primate vocalization, as well as 
evidence from aphasic studies, argue for a framework in which contributions 
from the entire extent of the neuraxis to language is considered. Lateralization 
of language functions may be a result of asymmetries in brainstem neuromodu- 
lator projection systems and corticolimbic organization. These asymmetries ap- 
pear to reflect the different functioning of two elementary, regulatory systems. 
These regulatory systems and their underlying subcortical-limbic-cortical cir- 
cuits provide mechanisms by which emotion, memory, and motor control, as 
well as language functions, are regulated and integrated across the neural hier- 
archy. 
Fundamentally, mental representation is analogical. A memory is formed as an ana- 
logue of perceptual experience or behavioral action. Language, however, is a remark- 
ably arbitrary code. The representational element, the word, has an iconic, analogical

relationship to its referent only in exceptional cases. Perhaps because of this arbitrary, 
symbolic nature, language is often approached in neuropsychological studies as if it 
were somehow removed from the more elementary neurophysiological mechanisms 
regulating alertness, sensation, and action. The neurophysiology of language is almost 
invariably assumed to be a neurophysiology of the neocortexmspecifically, the 
"higher" or "association" areas of the neocortexmwith only the most basic support 
functions (such as arousal and sensorimotor relays) provided by subcortical neuro- 
physiological circuits. The unique features of the human cortex, such as left hemi- 
sphere specialization for language, are often seen as the major clues to understanding 
neurolinguistic mechanisms. 
Animal communication often takes an arbitrary form. An arbitrary action, such as 
avian head bobbing, becomes routinized through evolutionary selection for its com- 
munication value (Tinbergen, 1951). However, the control of even arbitrary commu- 
nication in other animals, including higher mammals, is not restricted to the neocortex 
but engages multiple levels of the neural hierarchy, including primary adaptive control 
by the subcortical structures of the telencephalon (limbic structures and basal ganglia) 
and both regulatory and pattern-generation contributions from the diencephalic and 
mesencephalic levels of neural organization. 
In this chapter, we consider general themes of neural functioning that link together 
various cognitive operations, such as memory, attention, motor control, and language. 
These aspects of cognition are typically studied separately. However, because the 
human brain evolved, it may be possible to describe a set of primitive control pro- 
cesses and how more complex cognitive functions differentiated from them. We begin 
with a brief overview of cortical organization and its implication for functional inte- 
gration. We then discuss our theoretical efforts to understand the mechanisms under- 
lying hemispheric specialization for emotion and motivation. These mechanisms in- 
clude what appear to be asymmetries of the brain-stem neuromodulator projection 
systems and asymmetries in the organization of corticolimbic networks. Early on, it 
became clear that these basic mechanisms may explain important aspects of hemi- 
spheric specialization for cognitive functions, including language. The elementary sys- 
tems that evolved for activating and motivating vertebrate behavior remain important 
to controlling human behavior, including cognition as well as action. By tracing these 
themes of neural organization across brain-stem, limbic, and cortical levels, we sketch 
a theoretical outline of neurolinguistics that is speculative, and that lacks detail at 
several levels of analysis. However, this outline frames a neurolinguistics that includes 
not just the superficial articulation of language but the motivational basis that shapes 
its meaning. 
10-1. MOTILITY 
AND CORTICAL 
ORGANIZATION 
From his embryological and comparative studies, Herrick (1948) concluded that the 
major influence on the differentiation of the brain in evolution has been the acquisition 
of increased motor articulation. In the nervous system of amblystoma (the tiger sal- 

10 
Vertical Integration of Language 
161 
amander), Herrick observed that the regions of the brain not directly involved in 
sensory or motor functions, which he called the intermediate zones and include the 
cerebral hemispheres, increased in size and articulation as the system for action be- 
came more complicated. For mass movements, actions are competently instantiated 
within the primitive neuropil (synaptic network) of the sensory and motor zones, 
namely, the tectum and tegmentum of the brain stem, respectively. In contrast, in- 
creased sophistication in action, articulated movements removed from reflex arcs, ne- 
cessitated an equivalent increase in the size and differentiation of the intermediate 
structures responsible for further development and planning of these movements. 
Yakovlev (1948) also recognized the importance of motility and behavior to ce- 
rebral development. He noted that the vector of behavior, taken as an integrated whole, 
is formed as each sphere of motility gives rise to the next, operating from internal 
states to produce action on the environment. In this context, actions arise through a 
progression from axial, proximal movements to discrete, distal articulation, tracing the 
anatomical organization and control of motility. The first sphere of motility, expressed 
as internal homeostatic and visceral functions, is a basic property of all living organ- 
isms. For Yakovlev, social communication of internal states, including human lan- 
guage, is considered part of behavioral motility and thus belongs to the second sphere. 
By placing social communication within this sphere, Yakovlev clearly emphasizes the 
dependency of language on more primitive functions and recognizes that communi- 
cation is an extension of motility. The third sphere of action consists of behaviors that 
are directed toward changing the environment. 
Within this framework of the organization of behavior, the vertebrate brain shows 
a concentric organization, from the inside out, reflecting the central importance of the 
adaptive control of motility in evolution. Yakovlev's model of concentric organization 
(see also Pribram, 1960) parallels closely the approach we have taken to vertical 
integration (Tucker, 1993). The inner structures or lower centers are driven by ho- 
meostatic functions and the outer structures or higher centers orchestrate action se- 
quences. The core of the brain, organized around homeostatic centers of the hypo- 
thalamus and periventricular system, regulates visceral states and directs the action of 
the second ring. The second ring is organized around the brain-stem reticular network 
and the forebrain limbic and striatal structures. This level coordinates the activity of 
the homeostatic core, and it sets up biases that will determine how internal states are 
expressed in behavior, (Pribram, 1960). The third, most exterior ring is the cortex of 
the cerebral hemispheres mediating the "higher-order" negotiation of internal states 
with the environmental context. 
10-2. ANATOMY 
OF PRIMATE 
COMMUNICATION 
The general framework of concentric/vertical organization of the brain and behavior 
emphasizes the continuity and unity of action. Research on primate vocalization has 
mapped each level of neural organization and its contribution to the vocalization pro- 
cess. Ploog and his associates examined the neural control of vocal communication 

162 
Phan Luu and Don M. Tucker 
in the rhesus monkey with a systematic combination of electrical stimulation and 
lesion methods (Ploog, 1981, 1992). Elementary motor patterns of vocalization are 
organized at the brain-stem (mesencephalic) level. The more complex patterns of vo- 
calization that characterize species-specific communications are organized at the mid- 
brain (diencephalic) level, providing control and inhibition of the brain-stem centers. 
However, the emotional coloration and modulation of these communication patterns 
is missing unless the diencephalic circuits receive input from the limbic (telencephalic) 
structures. The paralimbic (archicortical) cingulate cortex appears to provide an ex- 
ecutive regulation of the limbic and midbrain influences, affording the monkey with 
the capacity for what Ploog terms "voluntary call initiation." At a still higher level 
of the neural hierarchy, the neocortex enables a more discrete articulation of the vo- 
calization, a "voluntary call formation," in which segments of the vocal pattern may 
be differentiated from the holistic midbrain expressive pattern. 
10-2.1. The Vertical Hierarchy and Functional Anatomy of Language 
The challenge for the brain is to achieve and maintain what may be called a vertical 
integration of the communication process, in which the direction and dominance of 
control is complex and distributed across the multiple levels of evolutionary organi- 
zation (Tucker, 1993). A similar neurophysiological analysis may be required to un- 
derstand the control of language in humans. The adaptive use of language may involve 
substantial influences mediated through limbic and midbrain pathways. Ploog (1992) 
points out that patients with lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex initially show 
profound deficits of initiative (akinetic mutism), and later show aprosodic and impov- 
erished speech, implying that the voluntary call initiation and emotional modulation 
provided by the rhesus cingulate may be paralleled by cingulate contributions to hu- 
man language as well. Ploog notes that certain areas of the limbic system have grown 
disproportionately large in humans, including the anterior thalamic limbic nuclei. 
These serve the supplementary motor area and premotor and orbital frontal cortices, 
suggesting that increased limbic input to the cortex, as well as increased input from 
the cortex to the limbic structures, has been integral to the evolution of the human 
cortex. 
In the clinical analysis of human language disorders, the requirement for support 
from intact subcortical circuits (brain-stem, thalamic, striatal, limbic) is certainly ac- 
knowledged, but it is often considered as a separate issue from the language operations 
themselves. However, Brown (1988) has argued that an adequate neuropsychology of 
language must include not only the final articulation of the expressive and receptive 
structure of language in the neocortex, but the full developmental process through 
which subcortical and limbic structures initiate and motivate an action pattern that 
then achieves articulation for expression or comprehension within the neocortex. 
Brown describes language generation as microgenetic, following Werner's assertion 
that there is a developmental progression, from syncretic and global to differentiated 
and articulated, in each cognitive event (Werner, 1957). Whereas Werner kept the 

10 
Vertical Integration of Language 
163 
evolutionary-developmental metaphor at an abstract, psychological level, Brown ad- 
vances a concrete anatomical interpretation. He proposes that the microgenetic organ- 
ization of each linguistic production recapitulates the phylogenetic organization of the 
vertebrate brain. The initiative for the vocalization (or idea) is recruited in the rostral 
brain-stem. At the midbrain and striatal levels, the action pattern is formed and mod- 
ulated by limbic motivational influences. At the cortical level, there is a progression 
from global organization in paralimbic networks toward increasing articulation of lin- 
guistic content as the representation takes form in neocortical networks. 
Brown's theoretical approach frames language within the anatomical framework of 
primate vocal communications. Within this framework, Brown suggests that the left 
hemisphere's cortical networks, the classical neurolinguistic centers, become important 
only in the final articulation of the microgenetic process, as the neocortex is engaged. 
However, in our theoretical work on the vertical integration of motivational and emo- 
tional functions, we have come to the conclusion that the lateral asymmetry of the 
human brain is not restricted to the neocortex, but may be an essential feature of 
multiple levels of the human neuraxis (Liotti & Tucker, 1994; Tucker, Luu, & Pribram, 
1995). 
10-3. MOTIVATIONAL 
BASIS OF 
HEMISPHERIC 
SPECIALIZATION 
In the evidence on hemispheric asymmetries for human emotion and motivation, sev- 
eral findings suggest that the cognitive specialization of the left and right hemispheres 
is closely linked to their differing motivational biases. For example, the left hemi- 
sphere's analytic cognition and capacity for sequential control of cognition appear 
closely linked to a person's anxiety level (Tucker, 1981). Evidence from normal emo- 
tion shows that anxious subjects tend to be highly focal and detail-oriented in their 
perception (Tyler & Tucker, 1982). Evidence from psychopathology shows that pa- 
tients with high anxiety often show deficits of language function (speech and test 
anxiety), but also show an analytic and intellectualized cognitive style that may de- 
grade to obsessions and compulsions (Shapiro, 1965) in extreme cases. Evidence from 
neuropathology shows that patients with a left temporal lobe epileptic focus may show 
a disorganized motivational control of verbal cognition that in some cases appears 
schizophreniform (Flor-Henry, 1969) but more typically presents as an intellectualized 
cognitive style in which verbal cognition is infused with emotional significance, lead- 
ing to a preoccupation with religious or philosophical themes (Bear & Fedio, 1977). 
If there is an inherent link between the motivational bias of anxiety and the lin- 
guistic cognition of the left hemisphere, then persons with pathologically low anxiety, 
such as psychopaths and impulsives, would be expected to show poorly developed 
verbal cognition. The lower verbal than performance IQ of these persons is a well- 
known observation from the traditional psychometric literature (Tucker, 1981). 

164 
Phan Luu and Don M. Tucker 
10-3.1. Self-Regulation through Activation and Arousal 
These various findings of individual differences raise the question whether the relation 
between the motivational bias of anxiety and left hemisphere cognition is a strictly 
trait phenomenon, or whether a certain state or level of anxiety is required for effective 
neurolinguistic function (Tucker, 1981). In this sense, "anxiety" would not refer to a 
discrete emotional state experienced rarely, but would be a quality of waking con- 
sciousness that may be integral, at some level of activation, to a motivated focus of 
attention. In attempting to examine the qualitative influences on attention and cogni- 
tion that may arise from states of motivational arousal, Tucker and Williamson (1984) 
examined the catecholamine (dopamine, DA, and norepinephrine, NE) projection sys- 
tems that mediate important aspects of the brain-stem control of alertness. 
In the Tucker and Williamson model, the focus on DA and NE to the exclusion of 
other neuromodulators, particularly acetylcholine, is a major limitation. Furthermore, 
the literature on the functional roles of neuromodulator systems has been both con- 
fusing and controversial, and no clear resolution has emerged (see Le Moal & Simon, 
1991). However, in the behavioral observations on the effects of manipulating DA or 
NE function there are indications of qualitative effects on behavior; that is, these major 
regulatory controls do not simply "activate" brain activity and behavior in a quanti- 
tative sense, but alter its character qualitatively. Drawing on the Pribram and Mc- 
Guinness (1975) concepts of unique attentional effects of elementary activating sys- 
tems, Tucker and Williamson (1984) formulated distinct cybernetic biases associated 
with each catecholamine projection system. The NE system appears to be sensitive to 
novelty and habituates rapidly. Tucker and Williamson theorized that this may form 
the basis for a phasic arousal system, underlying the perceptual orienting response, 
and operating under a habituation bias. The inherent affective quality to phasic arousal 
is elation. In contrast, the DA system is integral to initiating and maintaining action, 
and at high levels of function it leads to behavioral stereotypy. This system was 
characterized as a tonic activation system, supporting motor readiness, and operating 
under a redundancy bias. Its inherent affective quality is anxiety. 
These primitive neural control systems produce different modes of allocating at- 
tention and working memory. These modes are theorized to be differentially important 
to the left and right hemispheres. The DA tonic activation system, by biasing working 
memory toward redundancy, maintains a focused attention that may form a basis for 
the left hemisphere's analytic cognition. The NE phasic arousal system, by its habit- 
uation to constancy, selects for novel input and thereby produces an expansive atten- 
tional mode that may be integral to the right hemisphere's holistic cognition (Tucker 
& Williamson, 1984). 
The right hemisphere's contributions to language, as in humor and metaphorical 
comprehension (Brownell, Michel, Powelson, & Gardner, 1983), may draw on this 
more holistic semantic representation. Consistent with the notion that an elated emo- 
tional state engages the right-lateralized NE phasic arousal system, a positive emo- 
tional state has been shown to be associated with a more expansive, broadly associated 
mode of semantic representation (Isen, Niedenthal, & Cantor, 1992). 

10 
Vertical Integration of Language 
165 
The left hemisphere's specialization for complex motor sequencing has been seen 
as an important foundation for its specialization for language (Kimura, 1979). The 
redundancy bias of the tonic motor activation system provides a primitive cybernetic 
control that may be essential for the sequencing, routinization, and focusing of per- 
ception and action that results in a stereotyped, arbitrary communication pattern such 
as language. In verbal cognition, ideas and experiences must be analyzed into infor- 
mational units that can be verbally represented, and sequenced in the culturally shared, 
and thus predictable, pattern of grammar. 
In the normal brain, an adequate level of tonic activation--and anxiety--may pro- 
vide the neurolinguistic mechanism for the crisp delineation of ideas that is essential 
for analytic cognition and critical thinking. More excessive levels of tonic activation 
may produce the overly focused and restricted attention of the anxiety disorder patient, 
or the cognitive routinization and behavioral stereotypy of the obsessive-compulsive 
(Tucker & Williamson, 1984). The psychopathologies may be instructive for neuro- 
linguistics because they manifest exaggerated control mechanisms that are hidden 
within the balanced control structure of the normal brain. 
10-4. ASYMMETRIES 
IN 
CORTICOLIMBIC 
EVOLUTION 
That hemispheric specialization involves an asymmetry in corticolimbic networks 
was first proposed by Bear (1983). He recognized that the right hemisphere's spa- 
tial skills must draw on the spatial processing abilities of the dorsal cortical path- 
way. Liotti and Tucker (1994) agreed with this speculation, and argued in addition 
that the left hemisphere's analytic cognition, and its skill in codes such as lan- 
guage and mathematics, must draw heavily on the ventral cortical pathway that 
supports foveal vision and object recognition. The dorsal and ventral pathways of 
the cortex represent distinct patterns of connectivity between sensory and motor sys- 
tems and the memory operations of limbic structures. This is because they reflect the 
evolutionary roots of the neocortex at the dual points of origin in the archicortex 
(dorsal pathway) and paleocortex (ventral pathway; see Pandya, Seltzer, & Barbas, 
1988; Sanides, 1970). 
These theoretical efforts may suggest a new perspective on the interesting questions 
of hemispheric differences in corticolimbic interaction in the literature on lateralization 
and psychopathology (Bear & Fedio, 1977; Flor-Henry, 1969). They may also suggest 
additional ways of understanding the adaptive basis of hemispheric neurolinguistic 
mechanisms. The semantic base of neurolinguistic organization within the left hemi- 
sphere appears to be formed by the paralimbic networks (Brown, 1988). If the left 
hemisphere draws preferentially on the ventral corticolimbic pathway, important as- 
pects of the lexical organization of neurolinguistics may be understood to emerge 
from the more elementary capacity of this pathway.

10-5. ADAPTIVE 
CONTROL 
OF THE 
DUAL 
PATHWAYS 
10-5.1. Limbic Circuits 
Papez (1937) proposed a cortical-subcortical circuit involved in the experience of 
emotion. This circuit is centered on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere and 
involves the cingulate gyrus and hippocampus (both are cortical structures of the 
dorsal pathway), the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the hypothalamus. It is 
interesting to note that the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and hypothalamus are 
preferentially innervated by NE. Brown, Crane, and Goldman (1979) found that the 
hypothalamus received the densest NE innervation out of all the subcortical structures 
that they studied. A second major limbic circuit centered on the basolateral surface 
was proposed by Livingston and Escobar (1973). We refer to this circuit as the ven- 
trolateral circuit to be consistent with its anatomical position in relation to the dual 
trends of cortical evolution. This ventrolateral circuit involves the orbitofrontal cortex 
and temporal pole (both belong to the ventral cortical pathway), the amygdala, and 
the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and 
temporal poles are structures that are preferentially innervated by DA (Levitt, Raki6, 
& Goldman-Raki~, 1984). 
The two limbic circuits appear to have different roles in motivational and emotional 
experience. Kleist in 1934 (cited in Valenstein, 1990) noted that lesions to the me- 
diodorsal areas of the frontal lobe result in apathy and indifference. Indeed, it has 
been reported that large lesions to the anterior cingulate in man result in inattention, 
apathy, and ultimately a lack of self-initiated action or speech (Barris & Schuman, 
1953). Lesions to orbitofrontal regions, on the other hand, result in symptoms of 
disinhibition and difficulty in maintaining social relations due to lack of social con- 
straint and planning (Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1990; Eslinger & Damasio, 1985). 
Livingston and Escobar (1973) suggested that the ventrolateral circuit, with its con- 
nections to the temporal lobe, is involved in emotional interpretations of sensory 
information. In contrast, these authors believed that the mediodorsal circuit is involved 
in the regulation of activity. Disorders to this circuit can result in hypo- or hyperki- 
nesia. 
The similarities between the proposed functioning of the mediodorsal and ventro- 
lateral limbic circuits and the right-lateralized NE arousal system and the left-later- 
alized DA activation system, respectively, are striking. Thus, the activation and arousal 
systems appear to be made up of structures spanning the extent of the neural hierarchy. 
The ventrolateral limbic circuit involves the DA cell groups of the midbrain, the 
mediodorsal nucleus of diencephalon, the amygdala of the subcortical telencephalon, 
and the temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex. The locus coeruleus of the midbrain, 
the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the hippocampus and cingulate of the tel- 
encephalon make up the circuit of the NE arousal system.

10-5.2. Motivation of Dual Memory Systems 
The role of the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe in memory formation is 
well known (Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1991). However, the hippocampus may be more 
important to the formation of a particular aspect of memory than others (Nadel, 1992). 
Mishkin and colleagues (Bachevalier & Mishkin, 1986; Mishkin, 1982; Mishkin & 
Murray, 1994; Mishkin & Phillips, 1990) have outlined two memory circuits that 
involve different cortical and subcortical structures. One circuit consists of the me- 
diodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the amygdala, and the ventromedial aspects of the 
prefrontal lobe. We refer to this circuit as the ventrolateral circuit to emphasize the 
paleocortical components within this system. The second circuit involves the anterior 
nucleus of the thalamus, the hippocampus, and the mediodorsal prefrontal lobe (cin- 
gulate). We refer to this circuit as the mediodorsal circuit to emphasize the cingulate 
cortex and the hippocampus, both belonging to the archicortical trend. 
Although the differences in memory functions subserved by each of these circuits 
are not fully understood, there is reason to believe that the mediodorsal system is 
involved in spatial memory, which may be generalized to memory for context, and 
that the ventromedial system is involved in categorical memory, that is, memory based 
on identity of objects (Nadel, 1992). Based on findings that the hippocampus is im- 
portant to the processing and encoding of nonreinforced stimuli, Pribram (1991) sug- 
gested that the hippocampus supports the contextual representation in which behaviors 
occur. Similarly, Nadel (1992) believes that the hippocampal memory system empha- 
sizes the unique aspects of an event to be remembered. Thus, memory supported by 
the hippocampal system would resemble a key aspect of episodic memory. The asym- 
metric involvement of the right hemisphere in retrieval of episodic memory, as re- 
vealed by positron emission tomography, has been documented (Tulving, Kapur, Craik, 
Moscovitch, & Houle, 1994). In contrast to the contextual aspects of memory sup- 
ported by the dorsomedial system, the ventrolateral system supports memories based 
on object classifications and thus emphasizes generalizations (Nadel, 1992). 
Because these memory circuits are the same as the limbic circuits described earlier, 
the acquisition of memory within each system must be regulated by the emotional 
and motivational control biases of each trend. A characteristic of the mediodorsal 
memory system is that learning within this system is quickly acquired and subject to 
rapid extinction (Nadel, 1992). Nadel suggests that the rapidity in acquisition and 
extinction must be dependent on and regulated by exploratory motivations. This aspect 
of motivation is emphasized by the phasic arousal system outlined by Tucker and 
Williamson (1984) in which habituation occurs quickly and novel events are attended. 
In contrast, the ventrolateral memory system must be motivated by self-regulatory 
processes that are involved in evaluating information about objects in the environment. 
The ventrolateral circuit evaluates information received from the inferior temporal lobe 
and the amygdala appears to be critical to the experience of object familiarization 
(Pribram, 1991). We propose that the tonic activation system of Tucker and William- 
son provides the redundancy bias necessary to support the slow learning that occurs 
within the ventrolateral memory system (Nadel, 1992).

10-5.3. Motivation of Dual Motor Systems 
The evidence from cytoarchitectonic studies shows that there are two premotor areas 
in the frontal lobe, each differentiating from its respective cortical origin (Goldberg, 
1985; Pandya et al., 1988; Pandya & Yeterian, 1990). The anterior cingulate gives 
rise to the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the insular cortex, which is derived 
from the paleocortex, gives rise to the arcuate premotor area (APA). The SMA and 
the APA can be argued to represent cortical areas that have differentiated from the 
limbic circuits described earlier. Each new addition allowed the systems of self- 
regulation to be extended into the sphere of articulated action. 
Goldberg (1985) argued that the SMA and APA represent key components of a 
mediodorsal motor system and a ventrolateral motor system, respectively; each system 
has a different mode of motor control. The mediodorsal system has a mode of control 
that is characterized as feedforward. The action plans are internally generated and 
organized around a contextual framework. The guidance of action within this system 
is internally generated, based on probabilistic models of the future. The ventrolateral 
system, on the other hand, controls actions in a feedback mode in which external 
input, including information about an object, is evaluated and acted upon. This system 
is dependent on information about external stimuli to guide action. In contrast to the 
anticipatory nature of motor control of the mediodorsal system, the ventrolateral sys- 
tem is more interactive (responsive) in its mode of action. Elsewhere, we have sug- 
gested that the differences between these motor systems may reflect the differences 
in the functioning of the dual limbic circuits (Tucker et al., 1995); each limbic circuit 
would preferentially provide specific motivational biases for motor control. 
10-6. MOTILITY 
AND LANGUAGE 
Language may be seen as the human extension of the development toward increasingly 
articulated expressions (Yakovlev, 1948). In lower vertebrates, such as fishes, sala- 
manders, and some reptiles, motility is mostly axial. The development of limbs al- 
lowed for motility to be transformed from purely axial movements to appendicular 
(involving the appendages) locomotion. Furthermore, the progression of motility from 
the horizontal axis to the vertical axis freed the forelimbs from locomotion and allowed 
them to manipulate objects for the purpose of effect (to use objects as tools). In an 
evolutionary process known as preadaptation, the forelimbs became available for use 
as a means of communication (Kimura, 1979). Without the availability of forelimbs, 
communication must be largely limited to gestural postures. 
The emergence of pulmonic respiration provided the necessary foundation for the 
evolution of strategies for vocal communication (Lieberman, 1984; Yakovlev, 1948). 
The sounds that humans produce during speech reflect the additional development of 
the supralaryngeal tract (Lieberman, 1984). The ability to communicate vocally af- 
forded a major adaptive advantage over that of communication by gestural means: 
communication can occur in the absence of visual contact, and communication and 
tool use can occur simultaneously. 

10

The development of the supralaryngeal tract in humans can be regarded as a step 
in a system of communication that is uniquely human. Yet, the control of phonemic 
combinations is still yoked to mechanisms controlling the more fundamental ability 
of the motor system to organize and manipulate objects. From her work and that of 
others, Greenfield (1991) noted that children's ability to hierarchically manipulate 
objects, phonemes, and sentences develops in stages and that there is a coincidence 
in the developmental progression of these stages. Greenfield argued that the devel- 
opmental coupling of the stages is due to the fact that a common neural system, 
centered on prefrontal connections with Broca's area, underlies the control of object, 
phoneme, and sentence manipulation. Similarly, according to Kimura (1979), the con- 
trol system involved in speech disorders is not specific to speech control. This system 
also controls the performance of motor imitation and meaningless gestures, both man- 
ually and orally. Kimura calls this system the "praxis" system to emphasize its relation 
to the apraxias observed after lesions to certain cortical regions, including regions 
associated with Broca's area. 
The idea of language control being rooted in systems that were initially adapted 
for motor control has been extended to the cerebellum (Ito, 1993; Leiner, Leiner, & 
Dow, 1993), a structure that is traditionally believed to be predominantly related to 
motor functions. Leiner et al. (1993) traced the lateral expansion of the cerebellum 
and the development of the neodentate, a cerebellar nucleus, to their corresponding 
connections with frontal and prefrontal regions, including Broca's area. Furthermore, 
there are massive, but indirect, connections from these cortical areas back to the 
cerebellum. One pathway that Leiner et al. (1993) noted is the cortical projections to 
the red nucleus. The red nucleus in turn projects to the inferior olive. The inferior 
olive then relays to the cerebellum. The red nucleus, in most mammals, projects to 
the spinal cord and is thus involved in motor functions. However, in human brains 
this spinal cord projection is diminished and the projections to the inferior olive reflect 
a major output route instead. Leiner et al. argued that the reciprocal connections 
between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum allowed the cerebellum to be involved 
in language functions. The involvement may occur by adapting cerebellar mechanism 
of motor control for the purpose of regulating language functions. Ito (1993) outlined 
a model of cerebellar function in which the cerebellum models and automates motor 
sequencing and control. This cerebellar model is general enough that it can be adapted 
for language and higher-order processes. Thus, Ito argues that ideas and concepts are 
manipulated in a manner similar to the ways limbs are manipulated. 
10-7. A DUAL 
ROUTE 
INVOLVED 
IN 
LANGUAGE 
REGULATION 
Aphasia is a disorder of language often observed after cerebral lesions to the language 
areas of the dominant hemisphere. The deficits vary from comprehension to produc- 
tion, depending on the site of the lesion. Of the subtypes of aphasia, symptoms related 

170 
Phan Luu and Don M. Tucker 
to conduction aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia (TCMA) show marked differ- 
ences. Conduction aphasia is characterized as having spontaneous speech intact. The 
ability to repeat words, however, is severely impaired (Benson & Geschwind, 1985). 
In contrast, TCMA is characterized by impairments in spontaneous speech. The ability 
to repeat words and sentences are left intact. McCarthy and Warrington (1984) noted 
that in tasks that emphasized semantic processing the conduction aphasics excelled. 
In contrast, tasks that minimized semantic processing improved the speech production 
in the TCMA patients. McCarthy and Warrington postulated that the difference be- 
tween conduction aphasia and TCMA is due to damage to different routes of speech 
production. They argued that patients with conduction aphasia must have damage to 
a route that handles speech perception and articulation. On the other hand, they argued 
that the TCMA patients have damage to a route that handles semantic analysis and 
speech production. 
In keeping with the notion of a fundamental relation between language and motor 
functions, Goldberg (1985) suggests that the semantic analysis route is related to the 
mediodorsal system of motor control. This system is responsible for the initiation of 
speech from an internal source. The ventrolateral motor system is related to the pho- 
nological perception loop. This system is responsible for language functions requiring 
feedback loops, such as repetition. Indeed, Freedman Alexander, and Naeser (1984) 
observed that transcortical aphasia usually involves the separation of the SMA from 
the rest of the language areas of the frontal lobe. This observation led the authors to 
emphasize the important relation between the cingulate and SMA in speech function. 
Freedman et al. believed that this pathway represents a means by which limbic func- 
tions initiate speech. These authors contrast this pathway to another pathway that 
determines how language is produced. Clearly, Freedman et al. recognized the im- 
portance of limbic contributions to language processes of the mediodorsal system. 
However, we believe that both pathways are influenced by limbic inputs and that these 
inputs constitute biases that determine how language is produced. In other words, the 
way language is organized and produced within the ventrolateral system reflects the 
biases of the underlying motivational system. We propose that motivational bias of 
the tonic activation system provides the requisite influence to the ventrolateral speech 
system. Unlike the internal, contextual nature of the dorsal system's bias, the tonic 
activation system bias language functions in such a manner that feedback is the dom- 
inant form of control. 
The dual system of speech production may extend to language representation as 
well. Landau and Jackendoff (1993) analyzed the linguistic representations of objects 
and spatial relations and found that the number of words that represent objects over- 
whelmingly outnumber those that represent spatial information. Furthermore, words 
describing objects capture detailed object features, whereas words describing spatial 
relations lack detail specificity. Landau and Jackendoff argue that the nature of lin- 
guistic representation of space and objects is directly influenced by the nature of 
representations within the ventral and dorsal visuomotor systems, respectively. Indeed, 
as argued by Jeannerod (1994), only sparse information concerning object features is 
represented in the dorsal, "pragmatic," visuomotor system.

171 
10-8. LANGUAGE 
EMERGENT 
ACROSS 
THE NEURAXIS 
In previous papers from our group (Liotti & Tucker, 1994; Tucker, 1992), we have 
theorized that hemispheric specialization has evolved through differential development 
of the dorsal and ventral trends within the two hemispheres. Specifically, the left 
hemisphere seems to have organized its analytic cognition in line with the focused 
attention and object recognition skills of the ventral (paleocortical) cortical pathway. 
There is initial evidence suggesting that DA is preferentially distributed within ventral 
cortical structures (Levitt et al., 1984). This would be consistent with our speculation 
that the DA mode of tonic activation and motor readiness is integral to the left hem- 
isphere (Tucker & Williamson, 1984). Understanding the preferential emphasis on the 
cognitive skills of the ventral cortical trend within the left hemisphere may help to 
explain the integral role of object memory in the left hemisphere's contributions to 
language. In turn, understanding the preferential role of DA tonic activation in the 
ventral cortical pathway may help explain how the focused attention caused by the 
tonic activation system is integral to parsing objects from the perceptual stream. 
A similar continuity may be found across the memory, attention, and arousal pro- 
cesses of the right hemisphere. The spatial memory skills of the dorsal pathway may 
be integral to the right hemisphere's cognition, including its contributions to language. 
The broad attentional scope produced by the NE phasic arousal system may be a 
primitive control mode that sets up a foundation for spatial memory, at one level of 
organization, and for broad semantics, at a higher level. The right hemisphere's role 
in such language functions as humor and story comprehension (Brownell et al., 1983) 
may require this form of broad semantics. 
In everyday language, the organization of the communication process requires the 
coordination of both left- and right-lateralized attention/memory systems. Within each 
system there must be an effective vertical integration across the neuraxis to achieve 
elementary arousal control, the appropriate scope of working memory, and the re- 
cruitment of cortical systems in the representational process. This vertical integration 
requires that neurolinguistic mechanisms are not restricted to neocortex, but must 
operate across the phylogenetic hierarchy of the brain. 
The microgenetic approach (Brown, 1988; Werner, 1957) suggests that vertical 
integration is achieved in a developmental fashion in each cognitive act. A foundation 
of initiative and arousal in brain-stem and midbrain regions becomes elaborated with 
emotional significance through engaging limbic circuits, and then a progression of 
paralimbic and neocortical networks is recruited, tracing the evolutionary hierarchy 
of the cortex. The developmental progression results in a kind of recapitulation of the 
phylogenetic order. This recapitulation traces the development of cognitive process 
from global organization, centered on core-brain motivational mechanisms, to artic- 
ulated selections, drawing from the discrete control afforded by pyramidal motor path- 
ways. When this approach is applied to language, it becomes clear that the product 
of the overt communicative behavior only reflects the final contribution of neocortical 

172

areas. As it occurs in the context of daily life, language is a motivated process, or- 
ganizing the effective contributions of all levels of the neural control hierarchy. 
10-9. CONCLUSION 
We have outlined how motivational systems may provide fundamental biases to guide 
motor and cognitive processes. These biases may be crucial to understanding the 
motivational basis of hemispheric specialization for language. We have considered the 
possibility that the lateralization of these motivational systems may reflect a more 
fundamental asymmetry in corticolimbic organization of paleocortical and archicor- 
tical pathways. The organization of the catecholamines and limbic circuits according 
to the dual cytoarchitectonic trends may prove to be an important clue to the primitive 
basis of lateral asymmetry. For communication to be coherent, the final product must 
reflect successful elaboration across the neural hierarchy. Each self-regulatory system 
applies an inherent bias, such as the redundancy bias of the tonic activation system, 
that may shape not only the motivational direction, but the cybernetic mode of the 
communication, such as the tight parsing of the articulatory process. Language is an 
evolved process, and its phylogenetic roots are embodied in the neurophysiology of 
each psychological manifestation.

Brain lesion analysis has been used in clinical research for more than a century. 
From the discoveries of Broca and Wernicke to the offerings of modern neu- 
roimaging, the method of lesion analysis has been the source of current theories 
regarding the processing of language in the brain. This chapter discusses current 
methodological issues in lesion analysis and reviews work in this area since 1990. 
Moving beyond attempts to localize aphasia syndromes, lesion analysis is now 
exploring the specific deficits within such areas as semantics, syntax, and speech 
production and is beginning to guide in the diagnosis and prognosis of aphasic 
patients. 
The analysis of brain lesions in relation to behavioral deficits has been popular for 
centuries. In fact, most of what we know about how language is processed in the 
brain is due to lesion analysis. The theories of Broca (1861a; 1865), Wernicke (1874), 
and later, Geschwind (1965) were all based on correlations between the speech and 
language disorders of brain-injured patients and the locations of these brain lesions. 
Although these models are now undergoing some revision, the foundations of neu- 
rolinguistics and their modifications are still largely dependent on lesion analysis. 
"Lesion analysis" simply means comparing the brain structures lesioned in a pa- 
tient to the behavioral deficits exhibited by that same patient. These days, this involves

obtaining a CT or MRI scan on the patient (historically, autopsy data were used), 
defining the location and extent of the lesion, and then describing the structures in- 
volved either verbally or by depicting the lesion on a template. At the same time, 
careful behavioral testing is done with the patient to assess the extent of the deficit: 
which functions are spared and which are not. Conclusions can then be drawn as to 
the involvement of that brain area in the specific behaviors now seen to be affected 
by the injury. Some lesion analyses are on a case-by-case basis and are important 
because they represent interesting or unusual deficits that can offer rare insights into 
brain/behavior relationships. Other analyses are of groups of patients who exhibit 
similar deficits, such as aphasia syndromes or specific speech or language deficits. In 
this type of analysis, computer reconstructions of patients' lesions are sometimes over- 
lapped to determine whether they might reveal a common lesion shared by all patients 
with the disorder. 
The growing sophistication of both neuroimaging techniques and behavioral meas- 
urement has advanced lesion analysis to a new level. Not only has lesion analysis 
given us theories to work with, it now also allows us to test and refine these theories. 
In vivo neuroimaging shows the patient's lesion in great detail and permits us to 
expand our areas of consideration beyond just Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Improve- 
ments in measuring the language deficits are freeing us from such elementary contrasts 
as "expressive" versus "receptive" deficits. We are learning that aphasia syndromes 
are not the best guide for describing localizable deficits, because syndromes have not 
correlated well with isolated brain regions. We are also seeing that subcortical struc- 
tures may play an important role in language processing. Finally, lesion site infor- 
mation is becoming useful in predicting response to treatment and recovery of lan- 
guage functions. 
The remainder of this chapter will discuss some of the methodological considera- 
tions in lesion analysis and the contributions of new work using this technique from 
1990 to the present, including work from our own Aphasia Research Laboratory. Work 
prior to that time can be found in other volumes such as Ardila and Ostrosky-Solis 
(1989), Damasio and Damasio (1989), and Kertesz (1983). Our focus will be on 
humans who have lost the ability to process some aspect of speech or language, not 
on lesion studies of animals, since the comparison to complex human language is still 
difficult to draw. In addition, we will refer to lesion analysis here as the evaluation 
of the effects of structural damage, not functional or metabolic changes. For a sum- 
mary of PET studies with aphasic patients, see the review by Metter and Hanson 
(1994). 
11-1. METHODOLOGICAL 
ISSUES 
IN LESION 
ANALYSIS 
As with any technique, the success of lesion analysis depends entirely on how well 
it is carried out. Damasio and Damasio (1989) point out that the method is only as 
good as the sophistication of the experimental hypotheses and design, the behavioral 

11

tests used, the underlying neurological models, and the anatomical resolution used to 
define the lesions. All of these have improved dramatically over the past two decades. 
Our methods of investigating language disorders, for example, have been refined by 
the involvement of linguists and psycholinguists and their knowledge of language and 
linguistic systems. Improvements in the clinical assessment of language disorders have 
helped us to understand more of the range of deficits in these patients. Progress in 
neuroscience has changed the manner in which we think about the brain and brain 
function, as the other chapters in this handbook can attest. Finally, neuroimaging 
techniques now allow researchers and clinicians to evaluate the location of the lesion 
in vivo, while continuing to investigate the behavioral deficits of the patient. 
Still, researchers must be aware that the correlation of a behavioral deficit to an 
area of injury is not proof of localization of function to that area. The effects of 
diaschisis (the temporary effects of damaged areas on healthy ones), as well as plas- 
ticity and reorganization of function (the flexibility of healthy brain areas to assume 
the functions of damaged ones) must also be taken into account (see Kertesz, 1994a, 
for a review). However, the consistent and reliable association of behavioral deficits 
to lesion site cannot be overlooked and must, at the very least, imply a strong relation 
between a brain area and a behavioral deficit. 
11-1.1. The Use of CT versus MRI Scans 
The advent of neuroimaging techniques has taken the lesion method a big step for- 
ward. From the radioisotope studies of the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., Benson & Patten, 
1967; Kertesz, Lesk, & McCabe, 1977), computerized tomography (CT) of the 1970s 
and 1980s (e.g., Kertesz, Harlock, & Coates, 1979; Naeser & Hayward, 1978; Poeck, 
de Bleser, &von Keyserlingk, 1984), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 1980s 
(e.g., Damasio & Damasio, 1989), to the three-dimensional MRIs of the 1990s (e.g., 
Damasio, 1995), the techniques for localizing brain lesions for comparison with speech 
or language disorders have improved tremendously. They have, in many ways, sur- 
passed the advantages of autopsy data for lesion localization, as the resolution of new 
scanners is very high while the rate of consent for autopsy is very low. In addition, 
in vivo imaging can be done closer to the time of testing without the risk of additional 
neurologic changes that may occur later in life (Damasio & Damasio, 1989). 
The decision of whether to use CTs or MRIs in lesion analysis depends largely on 
the purpose of the study and the availability of the scans. The technology of the two 
differs significantly. CT scanning of the brain involves rotating an X-ray source and 
image receptor systematically around the head. A computer uses information about 
the attenuation of the X-ray beam to reconstruct a two-dimensional image representing 
a horizontal slice through the brain. Chronic strokes appear as dark regions, since 
they are filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which is less dense than healthy tissue (see 
Figure 1). 
MR imaging, on the other hand, involves no ionizing radiation, but instead uses 
nuclear magnetic resonance to produce high-resolution images. The powerful magnetic 
field of the scanner causes the spinning nuclei of atoms to align. A specific target is 

176

FIGURE 1 
A sample of a horizontal slice rendered by a CT scanner is shown in this figure. The lesion 
of this patient through the insula and Broca's area is seen as a dark area within the left side of the brain. 
By radiologic convention, the brain is imaged from the patient's perspective, with the left hemisphere of 
the brain on the right side of the figure, and the right hemisphere on the left. 
then stimulated by external radio-frequency waves, causing the atoms to wobble in a 
process known as "resonance." When the external source is turned off, the atoms 
return to their alignment (known as "relaxation") and release energy that can be 
detected and computer-reconstructed into two-dimensional images. Two different 
measurements of relaxation times can be made and are known as T1- or T2-weighted 
images. One of the advantages of MR imaging is that images can be rendered in three 
planes: horizontal (similar to the CT scanner), coronal, and sagittal. Thus, if a lesion 
cannot be seen clearly from one angle, it can be examined from one of the other two. 
In addition, MR images can be rendered in three dimensions with the appropriate 
protocols and software (see Figure 2). The resolution of MR imaging also far surpasses 
that of CT. 
Several studies discuss the general benefits of CT versus MRI scanning. For ex- 
ample, Mohr et al. (1995) found that CT and MRI were both good at the early de- 
tection of stroke, though they did not compare the two techniques at later times post- 
stroke, nor did they focus on their use in defining lesion boundaries. For case studies 
investigating lesion-deficit correlations, the use of either technique is generally ac- 
cepted, provided that the lesion can be clearly seen. 

11 
Brain Lesion Analysis 
177 
FIGURE 2 
These images represent samples of three-dimensional MRI lesion reconstructions of a pa- 
tient with anomic aphasia and apraxia of speech. The upper left image is a horizontal slice similar to those 
seen in CT images. The upper right image depicts a coronal section, and the lower left, a sagittal section. 
The lower right image shows a 3-D representation of the lesion on the lateral surface of the left hemisphere. 
For accurate definition of lesion boundaries, Naeser and Palumbo (1994) argue that 
the horizontal slices of CT scans show the depth of the lesion better than MRIs. They 
also point out that the differently weighted images (T1 and T2) of MRIs often disagree 
as to the extent of the lesion, with T 1-weighted images underestimating the border 
and T2-weighted images exaggerating the border. However, the superior resolution of 
the images and the addition of coronal and sagittal views from MRI scans are of great 
assistance in determining the involvement of specific gyri or structures, particularly 
when these can be computer-rendered in three dimensions. 
For group studies, it is preferable to stay with one type of scan, either CT or MRI, 
without mixing the two types. This is especially true when comparisons between 
patients will be made. However, this is not always possible, particularly when one has 

178 
Nina F. Dronkers and Carl Ludy 
to depend on existing scans from radiology files, as in retrospective studies, or when 
the expense or inconvenience to the patient is not medically warranted. For example, 
some patients find it difficult to lie still in the scanner for extended periods of time 
and cannot be re-scanned. Other patients with metal in their bodies, such as from 
pacemakers or surgical clips, should not undergo MRI scanning, because of the risk 
of the magnet dislodging the metal. The advantages and disadvantages of each tech- 
nique must be considered for each study, and must be determined by the purpose of 
that study. 
11-1.2. Time Post-Onset to Scan 
The time at which the scan is performed can make a significant difference in how 
well the lesion can be visualized and in judging its boundaries. Scans obtained on the 
first day after the injury are rarely useful in defining the specific lesion location, though 
they may differentiate between etiologies of the illness (e.g., stroke versus tumor). We 
have found that 3 weeks post-onset of the illness is the minimum amount of time to 
wait before obtaining a scan that can be used in determining lesion boundaries. This 
time frame is also advocated by Kertesz (1989). Kinkel and Jacobs (1976) advise 
waiting a full month, while Naeser and Palumbo (1994) recommend 3 months before 
the lesion has stabilized. 
In many cases, the timing of the scan depends simply on what scans are already 
available in the patient's files or for what purpose the scan will be used. If lesion 
boundaries are important because the lesion will be rendered onto templates or com- 
pared to other patients, then it is best to use chronic scans, at least 3 weeks post- 
onset, but preferably closest to the time of behavioral testing. However, as Damasio 
and Damasio (1989) point out, "data obtained during the acute or periacute period 
are not necessarily useless. Provided early anatomical and neuropsychological obser- 
vations coincide, their relations are still interpretable, and may be quite revealing. It 
is the cross-correlation of data from different epochs that is methodologically unac- 
ceptable" (p. 121). 
11-1.3. Time Post-Onset to Language Testing 
As with scanning, the amount of time post-injury at which behavioral testing is per- 
formed can make a significant difference in the findings. It is well known that patients 
can make significant recovery in the few weeks and months after injury, with language 
profiles changing considerably. For example, the language deficits of patients initially 
diagnosed with global aphasia will often evolve into a Broca's aphasia, and Broca's 
aphasic patients will often evolve into anomic aphasics. Patients with a Wernicke's 
aphasia immediately after their injuries almost never retain the Wernicke's aphasia, 
but evolve into conduction or anomic aphasics. Thus, studies that intend to associate 
areas of brain injury to behavioral deficits must first be certain that the lesions and 
the disorders have stabilized and will not evolve into other, milder deficits. 

11 
Brain Lesion Analysis 
179 
Those studies that have succeeded in localizing speech or language functions to 
specific areas of the brain have correlated chronic deficits with chronic lesions. Studies 
that use acute patients usually yield results with low correlations between lesion lo- 
cation and the deficit under study. For example, Basso and colleagues (Basso, Lecours, 
Moraschini, & Vanier, 1985) found that as many as 17% of their patients with aphasia 
did not support traditional models of language localization. Their study included pa- 
tients who ranged from 1 to 78 months post-onset and may have included those who 
were still evolving. Willmes and Poeck (1993) also found a poor correlation between 
aphasia type and lesion location in patients who were 1 to 340 months post-onset. 
They acknowledge that they mixed acute and chronic patients in their overall analysis, 
and point out that "unfortunately, localization studies are not based on predetermined 
and universally accepted dates of examination post-onset" (p. 1538). 
Kertesz et al. (1979) made a distinction between acute and chronic patients and 
found that the more stable relationships between deficits and lesions were seen after 
a year post-onset. We also recommend waiting at least 1 year post-onset, when the 
disorders have become fairly stable. This does not mean that patients do not show 
any change after 1 year, since gradual recovery continues even after many years. 
However, it is well accepted that the most significant gains are made in the first few 
weeks and months post-onset, with few major changes thereafter in most cases. 
11-1.4. Regions of Interest 
Predefining regions of interest involves stipulating, in advance, the areas to be inves- 
tigated, excluding all others. This approach is appropriate when certain regions are 
being compared to behavioral correlates and when specific hypotheses about areas are 
being tested. For example, Willmes and Poeck (1993) used broadly defined regions 
of interest in their analysis of lesion localization and aphasia syndromes. They were 
interested in whether lesions in specified brain areas would produce the aphasia syn- 
dromes predicted by traditional theories. Naeser and colleagues (Naeser, Gaddie, Pal- 
umbo, & Stiassny-Eder, 1990) investigated the involvement of Wernicke's area versus 
the subcortical temporal isthmus in their study of recovery of auditory language com- 
prehension skills in globally aphasic patients. Both studies were interested in specific 
areas and thus focused only on those regions. 
Sometimes an investigator will not restrict the analysis to certain regions of interest 
and will let the data determine which brain areas are related to a certain deficit. This 
is the approach we tend to take in our group, particularly in exploring relationships 
that have not previously been examined. For example, Dronkers (1996) compared the 
overlapped lesions of 25 patients with an articulatory planning deficit known as 
"apraxia of speech" with those of 19 patients without the disorder. The result led to 
the correlation between this motor speech disorder and a brain area previously unre- 
cognized for this function. By not confining the analysis to predetermined regions, a 
new functional location for one aspect of speech processing was identified. Thus, the 
region-of-interest approach tests given areas of theoretical importance, while the lesion 

180

overlapping method is less theory-dependent and allows the examination of areas not 
previously identified. 
11-1.5. Lesion Reconstruction Templates 
Some of the oldest templates are those of the renowned anatomist Dejerine (Dejerine, 
1901). These are carefully detailed templates with the structures clearly labeled 
and were used by Vanier and Caplan in their study of lesions in agrammatism 
(Vanier & Caplan, 1990). These classic templates are easy to use, but are not as 
readily adaptable to computer applications as are some of the other templates 
available. 
Naeser and colleagues use templates for CT scans (see Naeser & Palumbo, 1995), 
which are done at 15-20 ~ to the canthomeatal line, the imaginary line drawn from the 
canthus of the eye to the auditory meatus. They specify certain regions of interest on 
these templates and calculate the extent of the lesion within each area on a scale of 
0 to 5. With this method, they have analyzed numerous features of aphasia as well as 
the relation of certain lesions to recovery of these deficits. 
Willmes and Poeck (1993) used the templates and software described in Willmes 
and Ratajczak (1987) derived from the Matsui and Hirano (1978) atlas. Their method 
stores lesion information in a grid system of 16 templates that records the presence 
or absence of a lesion within each grid point. Neighboring grid points can be combined 
into regions of interest or specific anatomic areas. Lesions are overlapped by com- 
puting a "lesion similarity coefficient." This method can be helpful if predefined 
regions of interest are to be tested. 
Damasio and Damasio (1989) describe their system whereby different sets of tem- 
plates are used to accommodate the various angles that might be obtained for different 
patients during scanning. The advantage is that reconstruction is easier when the angle 
of the template matches the angle of the scan. The disadvantage is that lesions from 
different patients are difficult to compare when the templates themselves differ be- 
tween patients. However, this method is an excellent way of portraying a lesion and 
is used in a number of published case studies. 
The method used in our lab is that developed by Frey, Woods, Knight, Scabini, 
and Clayworth (1987). A behavioral neurologist trained in neuroimaging and a coau- 
thor of the reconstruction program reconstructs the lesions onto standardized templates 
derived from the atlas of DeArmond, Fusco, and Dewey (1976). These reconstructions 
are then entered into a mini- or microcomputer with software designed to depict the 
lesions in horizontal and lateral views and calculate lesion volume (see Figure 3). 
Because the templates are all at the same angle (0 ~ to the orbital-meatal line), lesions 
can also be overlapped when common areas of injury among patients exhibiting sim- 
ilar deficits are sought. 
All of these template systems are perfectly acceptable. Which one to use is entirely 
a matter of the type of experiment being conducted. The important thing to remember 
is to use the same template throughout the study so that lesions can be compared 
easily across patients.

used in lesion analysis. Computerized templates such as these also allow for the projection of the lesion 
on the lateral surface of the brain and the calculation of lesion volume.

ANALYSIS 
11-2.1. Review Articles 
Several articles since the early 1990s have surveyed progress in the lesion analysis of 
language disorders. Tranel (1992) covers work from 1990 to 1991, and Damasio 
(1992) provides an excellent review of aphasia and discusses the brain areas involved 
as determined by lesion analysis. Dronkers and Pinker (in press) present the aphasias 
in a description that is based largely on the results of lesion analysis. Books on aphasia, 
such as those by Goodglass (1993) and Benson and Ardila (1996), offer reviews of 

182 
Nina F. Dronkers and Carl Ludy 
11-2.2. Lesion 
traditional interpretations of lesion studies of language deficits, while edited volumes 
such as that by Kertesz (1994b) offer reviews of specific aspects of language functioning. 
Analysis of Aphasia Syndromes 
Lesion analysis research on language in the 1970s and 1980s was largely devoted to 
testing whether traditional autopsy-based models of language localization could be 
supported by new structural imaging techniques. Specifically, researchers were looking 
to see if the major types of aphasia were indeed associated with the lesion sites 
predicted by these theories. Early studies, such as Naeser and Hayward (1978), found 
traditional theories to be upheld when comparing aphasia classifications on the Boston 
Diagnostic Aphasia Examination to the patients' lesions on CT scans. However, the 
reverse correlation of predicting aphasia type from lesion site was not possible. Others, 
such as Basso et al. (1985), also found a poor correlation between lesion site and 
aphasia type. They found classical correlations less absolute than predicted and esti- 
mated a 12 to 17% exception rate, with all types of dissociations found. 
Willmes and Poeck (1993) took another look at the localization of aphasia syn- 
dromes and found even more disagreement than did Basso and colleagues regarding 
the probability of certain aphasia syndromes occurring in conjunction with defined 
brain regions. In a retrospective study of 221 patients, they compared the results of 
the Aachen Aphasia Test (Huber, Poeck, & Willmes, 1984) with lesions reconstructed 
onto their standardized grids previously described. Aphasia categories evaluated were 
global, Wernicke's, Broca's, and amnesic aphasia with two additional categories for 
those patients who were "nonclassifiable" and those who belonged to smaller "other" 
categories such as conduction, mixed transcortical, and transcortical sensory aphasia. 
Lesions were reconstructed onto grids derived from the Matsui and Hirano (1978) 
atlas and tested against traditional hypotheses of lesion localization. Some of their 
findings included a probability of only .48 that a posterior superior temporal lesion 
(including Wernicke's area) would result in a stable Wernicke's aphasia. Similarly, 
only a .35 probability was found for the hypothesis that anterior lesions would result 
in a Broca's aphasia. 
Several studies looked at single aphasia syndromes. In a paper describing CT scan 
correlates of a severe form of global aphasia, de Renzi, Colombo, and Scarpa (1991) 
found that only 35% of their 17 cases had the large lesions including Broca's and 
Wernicke's areas that are predicted with global aphasia. Rapcsak and colleagues 
(Rapcsak, Krupp, Rubens, & Reim, 1990) presented two cases of acute mixed trans- 
cortical aphasia with lesions restricted to the frontal lobe, without the additional pa- 
rietal involvement usually expected. In a study from our lab (Dronkers, Shapiro, Red- 
fern, & Knight, 1992), we found that lesions to Broca's area did not necessarily result 
in a Broca's aphasia, nor did the diagnosis of a Broca's aphasia reliably predict in- 
volvement of Broca's area. These studies demonstrate the difficulty of correlating 
aphasia syndromes to lesion sites. 
In fact, this lack of an association between aphasia syndromes and lesion site is 
not surprising. Aphasia syndromes are constellations of many different problems. For 

11 
Brain Lesion Analysis 
183 
example, Broca's aphasic patients have many deficits: fluency, comprehension, repe- 
tition, naming, and motor speech. It is unlikely that all of these functions would be 
processed in only one area of the brain. Although syndromes are a convenient short- 
hand for describing groups of deficits, they are not particularly useful as a means of 
investigating language processing mechanisms. As the next section will show, framing 
the investigation by using more specific criteria for defining deficits is a more pro- 
ductive approach. 
11-2.3. Lesion Analysis of Specific Deficits 
Several studies since 1990 addressed the localization of specific deficits in aphasic 
patients. These concerned various aspects of semantics, syntax, and speech production. 
The studies described in this section exemplify the direction this work is taking. 
11-2.3.1. Semantics 
In an effort to better characterize the semantic deficits that affect many aphasic pa- 
tients, Hart and Gordon (1990) sought patients with low scores on the Boston Naming 
Test and further probed semantic processing. They evaluated three levels: (1) supe- 
rordinate/categorization (do hammer and wrench belong to the same category?); (2) 
equivalence/single-word meaning (which is synonymous with engine: gas or motor?); 
(3) subordinate/property judgment (what has the same color as a skunk: a pig or a 
penguin?). Hart and Gordon found three patients who showed isolated impairment of 
single-word semantic comprehension, without deficits in speech perception or pro- 
duction. They then used the Naeser and Hayward templates to reconstruct the available 
CT and MRI scans and overlap the lesions. In doing so, they found an area in the 
posterior temporal lobe and a small portion of the inferior parietal region that were 
always lesioned .in the three patients with this deficit, but never in those patients 
without the disorder. The authors speculate that this area may be concerned with 
multimodal processing and integration of language. 
Rapcsak and Rubens (1990) report an interesting case with semantic jargon follow- 
ing a frontal lesion. The patient showed impairment on language output tasks that 
required semantic mediation, whether in spoken or written modalities. Language tasks 
that did not tax the semantic output system were unaffected. Speech and writing were 
fluent but incoherent, and writing showed "semantic agraphia" with good spelling to 
dictation but severe impairment of homophone spelling, which requires semantic dis- 
ambiguation of phonologically identical words (e.g., see~sea). Comprehension of 
speech and reading seemed intact. CT scanning revealed a large, left prefrontal he- 
matoma, extending from the orbito-frontal region up to the level of the lateral ven- 
tricle. Three months later, language retesting showed that all functions had returned 
to normal, including the homophone spelling test. The authors repropose Luria's 
(1976) idea that the prefrontal cortex acts as a semantic "monitoring device" with an 
important role in programming and monitoring ongoing cognitive activity, including 
language production. 

184 
Nina F. Dronkers and Carl Ludy 
Damasio and colleagues (Damasio et al., 1996) tested 127 patients with single brain 
lesions on a naming task using three different types of items: famous faces, animals, 
and tools. They found that deficits in naming each stimulus type were correlated with 
lesions in specific areas of the temporal lobe. Deficits in naming faces were associated 
with lesions in the left temporal pole, difficulty in retrieving animal names were related 
to lesions in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus, and errors in naming tools correlated 
with lesions in posterior inferior/middle temporal gyri and the temporo-parieto- 
occipital junction. The authors take this finding to support their theory that categories 
of words are represented in separate regions contained within a larger network. They 
also provide data from a study in normals using positron emission tomography that 
support approximately the same brain regions in the processing of these three types 
of information. 
11-2.3.2. Syntax 
The syntactic processing deficits of aphasic patients have been of great interest to 
neurolinguists. In previous years, investigations sought to locate a single syntactic 
processor in the brain. Broca's area was considered the most likely area, though later 
work failed to confirm a unique role for this or any other single brain region. In a 
study from our lab, Dronkers, Wilkins, Van Valin, Redfern, and Jaeger (1994) found 
that a new, unexpected area emerged as important to sentence comprehension. The 
anterior portion of Brodmann's area 22 (just anterior to auditory cortex on the superior 
temporal gyms) was lesioned in all patients with severe deficits in sentence compre- 
hension, but spared in those with only a mild disorder. However, it was not the only 
area lesioned in these severe patients. Broca's or Wernicke's areas were involved in 
some, but not all, patients, as were other frontal regions. This suggested that the 
processing of syntax involves contributions from several brain areas, presumably be- 
cause of the involvement of many aspects of language and cognition, including mem- 
ory and attention. 
Similar conclusions were reached by Caplan, Hildebrandt, and Makris (1996). In 
their large-scale study, they tested 60 patients with left or right hemisphere strokes 
on their ability to comprehend various syntactic structures. Using an object manipu- 
lation task, patients acted out the thematic roles in a set of 25 sentence types varying 
in complexity. The first interesting finding was that both left and right hemisphere- 
injured patients performed worse than normal controls on the more complex 
sentence types. This implies that the right hemisphere also contributes to normal sen- 
tence processing. Localization of the lesions in 18 of the 60 patients was also ex- 
amined. Five regions of interest were evaluated, including both parts of Broca's area 
(Brodmann's areas 44 and 45), the superior temporal gyrus (area 22), the angular 
gyrus (area 39), and the supramarginal gyrus (area 40). Lesions to all of these areas 
were found to affect syntactic processing abilities, leaving the authors with the con- 
clusion that these areas all contribute to a larger neural system underlying sentence 
comprehension.

185 
11-2.3.3. Production 
Baum, B lumstein, Naeser, and Palumbo (1990) compared the temporal parameters of 
speech production in patients with anterior lesions (Broca's area, anterior limb of 
internal capsule, lower motor cortex) versus those with posterior lesions (Wernicke's 
area, subcortical temporal isthmus). They used the Naeser and Hayward templates 
with these regions predefined. In general, they noted that speech production deficits 
could be found in both groups, with some differences. Patients with anterior lesions 
had more motoric difficulty with, for example, the interaction of the laryngeal system 
and supralaryngeal vocal tract. Posterior patients showed subtle phonetic impairments 
related to more global, durational patterns of speech, and showed more variability of 
production. Patients with lesions in both areas showed a combination of these deficits. 
The study demonstrated how even broad anatomical resolution inherent in a large- 
scale region-of-interest approach can combine with careful behavioral analysis to yield 
results that extend our understanding of speech production processes. 
Our group was interested in whether a common lesion could be found in patients 
who exhibit apraxia of speech, a disorder believed to affect the planning of articulatory 
movements (Dronkers, 1996). The lesions of 25 patients with this deficit were over- 
lapped, all showing involvement of a particular area of the insula. Nineteen patients 
without this disorder also had widespread lesions, but they spared the same small 
region of the insula that was involved in the speech apraxic patients. This is another 
example of how modern lesion analysis can identify new functional areas. 
11-2.4. Recovery from Aphasia 
Naeser and colleagues (Naeser et al., 1990) examined recovery in patients with global 
aphasia as tested with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam. They looked specifically 
at lesions in Wernicke's area and the temporal isthmus, two areas previously found to 
relate to poor recovery in Wernicke's aphasic patients. They found that most patients 
with lesions that involved at least half of Wernicke's area had a poorer recovery than 
most of the patients with lesions sparing Wernicke's area but including the temporal 
isthmus. Their regions of interest had not included other temporal areas that are now 
being investigated with regard to language comprehension and lexical retrieval (Da- 
masio et al., 1996; Dronkers, Redfern, & Ludy, 1995). However, this study was one 
of the first to apply the results of lesion analysis to issues of prognosis and recovery 
in aphasic patients. 
Kertesz, Lau, and Polk (1993) also examined recovery in 22 Wernicke's aphasic 
patients. Using templates derived from Matsui and Hirano (1978), they defined 31 
regions of interest within the left cerebral hemisphere. They found that persisting 
Wernicke's aphasia involved the supramarginal and angular gyri in the parietal lobe 
as well as the superior temporal area. The group with the best recovery tended to 
spare the superior temporal and middle temporal gyri. 

186 
Nina F. Dronkers and Carl Ludy 
We have also found temporal lobe cortex to be important in recovery (Dronkers et 
al., 1995). Five patients with severe and persisting Wernicke's aphasia were all found 
to have extensive lesions in the middle temporal gyrus and underlying white matter. 
A sixth patient had only deep white matter involvement of the temporal lobe. Although 
the patients with the cortical involvement have shown little or no change in their 
language deficits, the patient with the lesion restricted to deep temporal fibers is be- 
ginning to change after 4 years. How much recovery will be made remains to be seen. 
11-2.5. Response to Treatment 
One of the rewarding outcomes of lesion analysis is the possibility of applying its 
results to the treatment of the patients who contributed to the findings. One example 
of this is a study by Naeser and Palumbo (1994), who evaluated the success of using 
a computer-assisted visual communication treatment program known as C-ViC. Seven 
patients fell into groups of good versus poor responders. No one lesion site could 
separate the groups, but a combination of sites did differentiate between them. The 
patients with lesions in both the supraventricular area and the temporal isthmus re- 
sponded poorly to this method of treatment, while those patients whose lesions spared 
either of these areas showed a good response. Therefore, this treatment technique will 
not yield optimal results for patients with this combination of lesions. The authors 
suggest that outcome goals should be lowered in these cases. 
11-2.6. Size versus Site of Lesion 
Large lesions were often seen to result in severe and persistent language deficits. This 
finding led to the belief that lesion size is a critical factor in predicting outcome. 
However, Willmes and Poeck (1993), in their study of 221 patients, did not find any 
relation between lesion size and aphasia severity. Naeser and Palumbo (1994) sum- 
marize their work and that of others and conclude that lesion size is generally not 
helpful in making predictions about recovery. Recent research has focused less on 
lesion size and more on precise location. This is not to say that lesion size is irrelevant. 
The larger the lesion, the more chance that it will encompass critical sites. It is our 
increasing understanding of these sites that gives us the most information about lan- 
guage mechanisms in the brain and about how to use this information in treating 
patients with these disorders. 
11-3. CONCLUSION 
The method of lesion analysis has done much for the study of language and the brain. 
A century ago, lesion analysis taught us that certain brain regions could play spe- 
cialized roles in language processing. The identification of Broca's and Wernicke's 

11 
Brain Lesion Analysis 
187 
areas was due entirely to lesion analysis. Modern approaches, taking advantage of 
better behavioral measurements and high-resolution in vivo neuroimaging, continue 
this exploration into the neural mechanisms of language. 
The last few years have taught us much about language and the brain. First, modern 
techniques have allowed us to discover that, although aphasia syndromes may be a 
convenient way of summarizing a group of deficits, they are not particularly helpful 
in localizing language functions. The failure to find unitary brain areas underlying 
syndromes led to a better definition of the behaviors that contribute to these constel- 
lations of deficits. By specifying the components of the disorder, correlations between 
brain areas and behavioral deficits are becoming more reliable. In turn, theories about 
language and the brain are gradually evolving to incorporate these new findings. 
Lesion analysis has also turned the focus away from traditional areas such as 
Broca's and Wernicke's and has widened our view of the brain as a system of inter- 
acting parts that involves many more brain regions than those originally considered. 
These must all work in concert to produce a behavior as complex as language. The 
extent of the lesion is significant, not because of its sheer size, but because of the 
parts affected and their roles in this integrated network. 
Our interpretations of the consequences of specific lesions also enhance our ability 
to diagnose individual patients' deficits and to prescribe the most effective means of 
remediation. Lesion information can also assist patients and their families in under- 
standing the long-term effects of their injuries and how best to manage them. As 
information provided by lesion analysis becomes more accessible, it can only be used 
to greater and greater advantage. 
Lesion analysis requires a multidisciplinary approach. It has developed beyond its 
previous limitations because of the sophistication of the behavioral and imaging meth- 
ods contributed by numerous fields. This methodology epitomizes the interaction of 
the different specialties that have led to the success of neurolinguistics as a new 
scientific enterprise. In this age of exciting new developments in brain research, lesion 
analysis remains an important benchmark against which new methods must be tested, 
and will certainly continue to play an important role in the study of language and the 
brain.

CHAPTER 12 
The Sodium Amytal (Wada) Test 
Procedural and 
Interpretative Considerations 
Julie A. Fields and Alexander I. Triister 
Department of Neurology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160 
This chapter familiarizes the reader with the sodium amytal (amobarbital) test, 
both as a technique to establish hemispheric language capabilities in epilepsy 
surgery candidates, and as a procedure to gain insights into the neural correlates 
of language. After a brief historical overview, the chapter reviews the rationale 
underlying the use of the amobarbital procedure. Because the exact nature of the 
amobarbital procedure varies from center to center, we next provide a descrip- 
tion of how the procedure is performed at the University of Kansas Medical 
Center's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Some of the problems and considera- 
tions involved in the administration and interpretation of the amobarbital test 
are identified, and recent developments aimed at overcoming some of these prob- 
lems are highlighted. A discussion of the sodium amytal test's contribution to 
our understanding of inter- and intra-hemispheric differences in the organization 
of language concludes the chapter. 
12-1. A BRIEF HISTORICAL NOTE 
The intracarotid sodium amytal (amobarbital) test (ISA) was first described by Juhn 
Wada (1949) and thus is often referred to as the "Wada test." Wada originally

developed this technique to study the interhemispheric spread of epileptiform dis- 
charges in patients undergoing unilateral electroconvulsive therapy. Based on his 
observation that aphasia resulted when the language dominant hemisphere was in- 
jected with amobarbital, he reasoned that this technique might be useful in deter- 
mining hemispheric language dominance in neurosurgical candidates (and conse- 
quently avoid speech and language dysfunction in patients undergoing dominant 
hemisphere surgery). Favorable results were reported early (Branch, Milner, & Ras- 
mussen, 1964; Wada & Rasmussen, 1960) and the ISA is widely used (Rausch et 
al., 1993).

12-2. RATIONALE UNDERLYING THE 
ISA PROCEDURE 
The sodium salt of amobarbital, a di-alkyl substituted oxybarbiturate, is very lipid- 
soluble. Consequently it crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, and its anesthetic effect 
is rapid. Injection with amobarbital of the internal carotid artery (ICA) leads to phar- 
macologic inactivation of brain areas in the distribution of the ipsilateral anterior and 
middle cerebral arteries, and the anterior choroidal artery. The territories supplied by 
the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) can be anesthetized by separate PCA amobarbital 
injection when supplementary information is desired about memory function. Fig- 
ure 1 presents SPECT scans showing the territories inactivated by right ICA and PCA 
amobarbital injections.

The ICA injection perfuses with amobarbital the areas in the frontal and temporal 
lobes pertinent to speech and language functions, and the anterior one-third of the 
hippocampus. The PCA injection perfuses occipitoparietal and posterior mesial tem- 
poral regions. Because injection of amobarbital into an ICA temporarily inactivates 
only one cerebral hemisphere, the ISA allows one to assess independently the cog- 
nitive functions served by each hemisphere; that is, it is assumed that disruptions of 
language and memory during ISA are a consequence of the temporary "lesioning" 
of the injected hemisphere, and that ISA mimics the effects that surgery on the injected 
hemisphere might have. A schema for ISA administration and interpretation is illus- 
trated in Figure 2. 
12-3. THE ISA PROCEDURE" 
A SAMPLE PROTOCOL 
Following is a description of the ISA procedure as it is performed at our center. It is 
emphasized that this serves only as an example for the reader. Protocols vary across 
centers, and some of these differences will be discussed later. Two to four hours prior 
to the first ISA injection, a baseline cognitive evaluation is completed using one of 
five alternate protocols. This not only serves to establish a baseline score against which 
to compare ISA results, but also to familiarize the patient with the protocol and to 

12 
Sodium Amytal Test 
193 
obtain informed consent. Baseline evaluation also allows the clinician to observe 
whether any conditions exist that might contraindicate ISA testing (e.g., if the patient 
has had a seizure in the last 24 hours, it is possible that post-ictal confusion is present; 
the patient might not have complied with fasting requirements; he/she might dem- 
onstrate signs of anticonvulsant toxicity; or he/she might have a mood disturbance 
making it difficult to comply with the procedure). Importantly, baseline evaluation 
affords the opportunity to provide the patient with memoranda, the recall of which is 
assessed during the ISA procedure. 
At our center we evaluate serial speech, word reading, color naming, object naming 
to visual and tactile confrontation, praxis, sentence repetition, aural sentence compre- 
hension, preposition comprehension, syntactic comprehension, identification of a facial 
expression, and memory for visually and aurally presented stimuli. 
For ISA testing, the patient is transported to the radiology suite. Following local 
anesthesia, the right femoral artery is punctured. A guide wire and catheter are ad- 
vanced under fluoroscopic guidance through the femoral artery and aorta to a point 
just distal to the ICA's origin. An angiogram is performed to visualize the vasculature 
and identify any potential abnormalities, and to determine if the contrast material 
perfuses vessels other than those intended (e.g., whether cross-flow to the other hemi- 
sphere occurs, or if the posterior cerebral artery fills via the posterior communicating 
artery). 
Typically, the left ICA is injected first (other centers often first inject the hemi- 
sphere ipsilateral to surgery), using a dose of 100 mg amobarbital. The amobarbital 
is mixed with a small amount of radioactive material (Tc99mHMPAO or Tc99mECD), 
so that following ISA a SPECT scan can be performed to visualize distribution of the 
amobarbital. At time of injection, the patient, who is supine, is instructed to hold his/ 
her arms straight up and to begin counting. Upon injection, the patient almost im- 
mediately becomes hemiplegic or hemiparetic contralateral to side of injection, and 
the patient's arm opposite to the side of injection becomes limp. Following language- 
dominant hemisphere injection, the patient typically evidences speech arrest, and sub- 
sequently dysphasic speech. Testing continues using a protocol similar to the one 
outlined in Table 1. 
EEG is monitored continuously for delta-wave activity, and arm strength is checked 
periodically throughout testing to ascertain drug effect, which can last anywhere from 
90 to 300 seconds (Rausch & Risinger, 1990). After hemiplegia has resolved, and the 
EEG has returned to baseline, the patient's recall and recognition of stimuli presented 
prior to and during drug effect are assessed. 
The second hemisphere is injected 60 minutes after first injection to ensure recovery 
from first injection. Scores obtained on the memory protocol are expressed as a per- 
centage relative to baseline score. We consider a memory score below 80% of baseline 
a failure. In addition, performance on memory and language items is compared after 
left and right ISA injection, as is occurrence of speech arrest, so as to make a judgment 
about hemispheric language dominance and possible asymmetries in memory per- 
formance.

12-4. PROBLEMS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
IN ISA PROTOCOL ADMINISTRATION 
AND INTERPRETATION 
Although the rationale underlying the ISA seems straightforward, the performance 
and interpretation of the test are not. Both the determination of speech dominance and 
that of memory representation are highly subjective. Protocols for the ISA vary from 
center to center (Loring, Lee, & Meador, 1994; Rausch et al., 1993; Snyder, Novelly, 

12 
Sodium Amytal Test 
195 
& Harris, 1990), making meaningful data comparisons difficult. Some of the more 
important between-center and intersubject differences, which affect ISA language test 
result interpretation, are discussed in the following sections. Readers interested in the 
controversy about the validity and reliability of ISA memory assessment are referred 
to reviews by Jones-Gotman et al. (1993), Loring, Lee, and Meador (1994), and 
Rausch et al. (1993). Some of the considerations detailed here, however, apply equally 
to language and memory assessment. 
12-4.1. Patient Selection 
When only certain patients are subjected to ISA, the generalizability of the findings 
remains in question, thus complicating evaluation of the ISA's predictive power. Some 
centers select for ISA only those patients showing evidence of bilateral brain disease 
or left-handedness (Snyder et al., 1990), and others exclude right-handed patients 
being considered for right temporal lobectomies (Jones-Gotman, 1987). Some centers 
perform the ISA on only one hemisphere (Rausch et al., 1993), which becomes a 
significant issue in cases of bilateral speech representation. Without assessing both 
hemispheres, the conclusion that language is solely in one hemisphere is invalid (Dod- 
rill, 1993; Loring, Lee, & Meador, 1994), and candidates who undergo surgery based 
on results obtained from a single injection may be at greater risk for postoperative 
language deficits. 
12-4.2. Drug Administration 
Most frequently, sodium amobarbital is the anesthetic agent of choice. However, Cou- 
beset al. (1995) report that in France, where amobarbital has not been approved for 
use, methohexital is used. This drug's shorter effect allows both hemispheres to be 
evaluated within 2 hours. Unfortunately, the quantity of test stimuli must be decreased, 
possibly limiting confidence in the test results. Furthermore, given methohexital's epi- 
leptogenic potential, the drug is usually injected along with an anticonvulsant. 
Drug parameters--for example, amobarbital dosage and concentration, volume of 
amobarbital and saline mixture, rate of delivery (steady or incremental), and method 
of delivery (hand or automated injection)--also vary widely (Loring, Meador, & Lee, 
1992a; Rausch et al., 1993) and can lead to discrepant findings. Drug parameters affect 
extent and duration of anesthesia: A faster rate or larger volume of injection will 
typically perfuse a more extensive vasculature, thus compromising more domains of 
function; smaller volumes, or slower rates of injection will lead to a greater concen- 
tration of drug in a smaller area, possibly leading to more intense or prolonged drug 
effects. Anesthetization should not be so sedating or persistent that the patient cannot 
respond, yet should be sufficient to create a condition modeling as closely as possible 
the effects of surgery, and long enough to permit presentation of an adequate number 
of test items and thus valid inferences from test results. 
Occasionally, there will be cross-filling of the contralateral hemisphere or the pos- 
terior cerebral artery, leaving uncertainty about the neural bases of elicited responses 

196 
Julie A. Fields and Alexander I. Triister 
(Hart et al., 1991; 1993). Interpretation of the ISA is predicated on the assumption 
that brain regions supplied by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries are inactivated. 
A neuroimaging study by Hart et al. (1993) suggests that this assumption should not 
be made in all cases. Using SPECT, they reported that there is great interindividual 
variability in the regions actually perfused by amobarbital after ICA injection. Al- 
though some centers determine likelihood of cross-flow of amobarbital into the con- 
tralateral hemisphere or perfusion of other territories by amobarbital via angiography, 
the correlation between contrast medium and amobarbital distribution is limited by 
differences in methods of injection of contrast media and amobarbital (e.g., Rausch 
et al., 1993). 
12-4.3. Determination of Adequacy of Anesthesia and Timing 
of Stimulus Presentation 
Among many features of ISA protocols that differ across centers (Benbadis, Dinner, 
Chelune, Piedmonte, & Ltiders, 1995; Dodrill, 1993; Jones-Gotman, 1987; Loring, 
Lee, & Meador, 1994; Rausch et al., 1993; Snyder et al., 1990) are the determination 
of when an adequate drug effect is evident, timing of stimulus presentation, types of 
stimuli and response formats, and criteria used to infer adequacy of language and 
memory. It is agreed across centers that presentation of stimuli is contingent on ad- 
equate hemispheric anesthetization. In order to achieve a model of how the brain will 
function if tissue were removed, testing should occur during maximum drug effect. It 
has been shown, for example, that memory items presented earlier, during maximal 
drug effect, are more sensitive to lateralizing seizure onset and predicting lateralized 
temporal lobe impairment than are items presented later, when drug effects have worn 
off to some extent (Loring, Lee, & Meador, 1994; Loring, Meador, et al., 1994; Rausch 
et al., 1993). 
Unfortunately, means of determining onset and duration of adequate anesthesia 
differ across centers. One or more of the following might be used to infer adequate 
anesthesia: contralateral hemiparesis (although different centers consider anywhere 
from 0/5 to 4/5 as adequate), grip strength, loss of antigravity tone, and marked EEG 
slowing. Yet other centers simply present stimuli during a predetermined, standard 
interval (Rausch et al., 1993). Even if anesthetic effect were similarly defined across 
centers, there would still be disagreement about timing of stimulus presentation. When 
the speech-dominant hemisphere is injected, and speech arrest ensues, some clinicians 
wait for speech return before proceeding with testing, whereas others continue stim- 
ulus presentation regardless of speech difficulty. Each approach has advantages and 
disadvantages. Waiting too long for speech impairments to resolve means that other 
cognitive functions will also be recovering, thus increasing the probability of a false 
negative result on the memory test (i.e., incorrectly concluding that the hemisphere 
opposite to the one inactivated can adequately sustain memory). On the other hand, 
if items are administered during acute sedation, speech arrest, or aphasia, it becomes 
difficult to determine why memory items are failed. Consequently, the potential for a 
false positive result with respect to memory increases (i.e., one might incorrectly 

12 
Sodium Amytal Test 
197 
conclude that the hemisphere oppositeto the one injected cannot adequately sustain 
memory). Although Lesser, Dinner, Lfiders, and Morris (1986) reported that the pres- 
ence of aphasia does not necessarily imply that stimuli will not be remembered, this 
does not imply that memory failure is not attributable to aphasia. 
12-4.4. Criteria to Establish Hemispheric Language Dominance 
What exactly constitutes evidence for the presence of language in a cerebral hemi- 
sphere? Speech arrest might not be a sufficient criterion for determining the presence 
of language because it may reflect motor or motivational factors rather than language 
disruption. From a clinical standpoint, speech arrest might, however, be sufficient to 
suggest that hemispheric language mapping by electrical stimulation be undertaken. 
Most frequently, disruption of object naming is employed as a measure of speech 
representation, followed by response to verbal commands, ability to count, unspecified 
dysphasic signs, and word/phrase repetition (Dodrill, 1993; Rausch et al., 1993; Sny- 
der et al., 1990). Although these criteria enable establishment of left or right speech 
dominance with relative ease (Rausch et al., 1993), less clear are the criteria to estab- 
lish bilateral language representation. 
Benbadis et al. (1995) attempted to provide objective criteria for determination of 
hemispheric language dominance. Three sets of criteria based on speech arrest were 
employed: absolute duration, side-to-side difference, and a laterality index computed 
as (L-R/L+R). The three methods yielded the same classification of hemispheric 
language dominance in 86% of 142 patients. In the remaining patients, the three 
methods differed with respect to unilateral or bilateral language classifications. Al- 
though the establishment of objective criteria represents an advance, these criteria were 
derived from ISA data without validation against an external standard. A more serious 
concern is that the cutoff scores used to determine hemispheric language dominance 
were derived from a subset (123) of the 142 subjects in the sample. Consequently, 
the accuracy of these criteria awaits cross-validation in an independent sample. 
12-5. RECENT 
DEVELOPMENTS 
AIMED 
AT 
IMPROVING 
ISA VALIDITY 
AND RELIABILITY 
12-5.1. Drug Administration 
In an attempt to overcome the difficulties posed by possible oversedation in patients 
receiving bolus injections of amobarbital, Levin, Cantrell, Soukup, Crow, and Bartha 
(1994) evaluated an incremental drug administration procedure. In this procedure, a 
concentration of 10 mg amobarbital per ml saline was injected at the rate of 2-3 ml/ 
sec until a flaccid hemiplegia developed. A comparison of seven patients undergoing 
the incremental procedure, and seven undergoing the bolus procedure, revealed that 
the incremental procedure produced less sedation, required less total drug, and yet 
adequately demonstrated hemispheric differences in language and memory. 

198 
Julie A. Fields and Alexander I. Triister 
12-5.2. Supplementary 
Procedures 
Several procedures have been employed to enhance reliability and validity of the ISA 
(Coubes et al., 1995; Hart et al., 1993; Jack et al., 1989; Jeffery et al., 1991; Jones- 
Gotman et al., 1993; Lee, Loring, Smith, & Flanigin, 1995; Loring, Meador, & Lee, 
1992b). Because the predictive validity of these procedures remains to be determined, 
they are all best considered supplements rather than alternatives to the ISA (Kurthen, 
Solymosi, & Linke, 1993). 
12-5.2.1. EEG and Electrocorticography 
Some centers consider surface EEG during ISA helpful in locating and monitoring of 
slowing after amobarbital injection, whereas others do not (e.g., Dodrill, 1993). Some 
centers perform the ISA after intracranial electrode implantation so as to permit EEG 
recording directly from subdural grid and/or strip electrodes, as well as depth elec- 
trodes implanted in the mesial temporal lobes. Gotman, Bouwer, and Jones-Gotman 
(1992), for example, reported that the standard ISA injection produced adequate EEG 
slowing in the anterior and middle hippocampus. In addition, although ISA also was 
associated with slowing in the hemisphere contralateral to the injected one, this slow- 
ing was less pronounced and briefer than in the injected hemisphere. 
12-5.2.2. Neuroimaging 
Concern has been expressed about particular brain regions inactivated during ISA: 
several studies (Coubes et al., 1995; Hart et al., 1993; Jeffery et al., 1991) have shown 
that the cerebral distribution of amobarbital and methohexital varies among individ- 
uals. Perhaps it is for this reason that not all patients who develop expressive aphasia 
during dominant hemisphere ISA also develop language comprehension deficits (Hart 
et al., 1991), and that only some patients demonstrate memory failures after ISA. Hart 
et al. (1993), for example, found that SPECT indicated mesial temporal inactivation 
during ISA in only 28% of cases. SPECT scanning accompanying ISA might assist 
in providing verification of brain regions perfused, and thus assist interpretation of 
ambiguous cognitive evaluation results (Hart et al., 1993; Kurthen et al., 1988). Func- 
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a noninvasive technique, may be useful 
in corroborating ISA test results, at least in the domain of language (Binder et al., 
1996; Desmond et al., 1995). However, the evidence to date is best considered pre- 
liminary until a larger number of individuals, especially with atypical language rep- 
resentation, are studied. 
12-5.2.3. Selective Amobarbital Injections 
Sometimes it is difficult to interpret the ISA because of excessive sedation or language 
impairment. One option is to readminister the ISA using an equal or lower dose of 
amobarbital (Loring, Meador, Lee, & King, 1992; Loring, Lee, & Meador, 1994). 

12 
Sodium Amytal Test 
199 
Another option is to evaluate cognition after injection of a vessel supplying a more 
limited cerebral territory, a technique also helpful in identifying extratemporal seizure 
origin (e.g., Brundert, Elger, Solymosi, Kurthen, & Linke, 1993). Selective injections 
are used typically to evaluate memory rather than language, although Tr6ster et al. 
(1996) report on letter-by-letter reading following PCA injection of the language- 
dominant hemisphere. 
12-5.3. Validation Studies 
The validity of the ISA to establish hemispheric language dominance is well accepted 
(see Dodrill, 1993; Kurthen, 1992). The interesting question raised by recent studies 
is whether cases undergoing ISA, and consequent cortical mapping, have better out- 
comes than do cases without language mapping. Among left-hemisphere language- 
dominant patients who underwent ISA and then conservative left temporal lobe re- 
section without language mapping, no significant post-operative language decrements 
were observed by Davies, Maxwell, Beniak, Destafney, and Fiol (1995). Hermann 
and Wyler (1988), comparing outcome in two groups of 13 patients who underwent 
temporal lobectomy on the language-dominant hemisphere either with or without func- 
tional mapping, found visual naming decrements to be more pronounced in the group 
that did not undergo mapping, despite the fact that the extent of resection was more 
conservative in this group. In a larger follow-up study of 162 patients who underwent 
temporal lobectomy without mapping, Hermann, Wyler, Somes, and Clement (1994) 
observed a postoperative dysnomia in 7% of left lobectomy patients. Furthermore, an 
association between later age at onset of epilepsy and postoperative dysnomia was 
observed in the left lobectomy group. However, it is not clear whether outcome would 
have been different in a group undergoing language mapping. Thus, although as a 
group, patients undergoing lobectomy without mapping might fare well postopera- 
tively, the fact that a subgroup of individuals with postoperative dysnomia can also 
be identified suggests that mapping after ISA might be the prudent course of action 
to take until more definitive data are available. 
12-6. A CAUTIONARY 
NOTE 
CONCERNING 
THE 
ISA IN PEDIATRIC 
POPULATIONS 
Research about the ISA in pediatric populations is extremely limited. Discussion about 
the ISA in children and adolescents is frequently couched in terms of adult research 
findings (e.g., Bernstein, Prather, & Rey-Casserly, 1995). However, a few empirical 
studies suggest that the ISA protocol might need to be modified for children and 
adolescents. Szabo and Wyllie (1993) noted that language dominance was established 
in all children who had bilateral injections and at least borderline intelligence, but in 
only about half of the children with mental retardation. These authors and Williams 
and Rausch (1992) also caution that children under 13 years of age might demonstrate 
an inappropriately high memory failure rate, suggesting the possible need for a lower 

200 
Julie A. Fields and Alexander I. Trtister 
cutoff score. Westerveld et al. (1994) reported more encouraging data. Using amo- 
barbital doses of 100 or 130 mg, they considered the ISA to yield unambiguous data 
concerning language dominance in children as young as 7 years. 
12-7. HAS THE ISA TAUGHT 
US ANYTHING 
OF THEORETICAL 
SIGNIFICANCE 
ABOUT 
LANGUAGE? 
The ISA bears several advantages as a research tool relative to traditional lesion 
studies (Tr6ster et al., 1996). Specifically, it is possible to obtain baseline data in the 
individual to be studied, to compare lesion effects on both hemispheres in the same 
individual, to gather group data where the "lesion "-to-assessment interval is relatively 
homogeneous, and to reverse the lesion. Disadvantages of the ISA entail the brevity 
of the drug effect and the possibly limited generalizability of findings. When gathering 
clinically relevant information is of paramount importance, there is, within the time 
constraints of the ISA, little opportunity to manipulate the nature of stimuli. Further- 
more, because the ISA is carried out in individuals with typically chronic cerebral 
dysfunction, it is unclear if findings obtained apply to normal populations, or even to 
groups with other forms of cerebral dysfunction. 
12-7.1. Handedness and Hemispheric Language Dominance 
One domain of inquiry richly informed by ISA studies is the relationship between 
handedness and hemispheric language dominance. A study commonly cited to refer- 
ence the distribution of handedness and speech lateralization in the general population 
(Rasmussen & Milner, 1977) reported that 96% of right-handed individuals were left- 
hemisphere speech-dominant. Among left-handed individuals, 70% were left- 
hemisphere dominant, 15% right-hemisphere dominant, and 15% were deemed to have 
bilateral speech representation. However, this sample may not be representative of a 
normal population, or even of all individuals with epilepsy, given the criteria employed 
to select patients for ISA (Woods, Dodrill, & Ojemann, 1988). 
Although right-handedness is highly correlated with left-hemisphere speech dom- 
inance in a normal population, ISA studies reveal that brain injury has a tendency to 
alter this relationship. Specifically, early brain injury is often associated with a shift 
in language dominance (Rey, Dellatolas, Bancaud, & Talairach, 1988; Satz, Strauss, 
Wada, & Orsini, 1988; Woods et al., 1988), but a shift in language dominance does 
not necessarily entail a shift of handedness, or vice versa. Satz et al. (1988) reported 
that only 68% of patients who shifted language or hand preference shifted both. When 
only handedness or language shifted, language was more likely to shift. 
Several studies have identified factors associated with shifts in language and hand- 
edness: injury extent and location, and age at injury. Woods et al. (1988) found that 
left-hemisphere injuries sufficient to cause hemiparesis were associated with both left- 
handedness and right or bilateral speech representation. Among patients without hemi- 

12 
Sodium Amytal Test 
201 
paresis, sinistrality and right or bilateral language representation were associated with 
extratemporal pathology. Left-handers with left-hemisphere speech dominance were 
less likely to have had hemiparesis or extratemporal injuries. Kurthen et al. (1994) 
too reported that extratemporal lesions, and multiple or bilateral seizure foci (but not 
handedness or laterality of seizure focus), were related to atypical speech represen- 
tation. 
Another factor underlying atypical language representation is the age at which 
injury occurs. Because resiliency of the brain is maximal during the early years of 
life (Satz et al., 1988), injury at a very early age might induce either the intact or 
damaged hemisphere to reorganize (i.e., accommodate speech and language zones) so 
as to compensate for functional losses (Liederman, 1988; Satz et al., 1988). Satz et 
al. (1988) found that intrahemispheric language reorganization was more likely than 
interhemispheric reorganization after age 6 (speech was ipsilateral to the lesion in 
78% of these cases). Interhemispheric organization is more likely to occur at earlier 
ages, but unfortunately, not without possible cost to nonverbal functions (i.e., crowd- 
ing). 
Strauss, Satz, and Wada (1990) evaluated verbal and nonverbal functions during 
ISA in epileptic patients with early onset of left-hemisphere dysfunction. They found 
that patients with atypical speech representation performed as well as patients with 
left-hemisphere speech on most measures of language function. However, the patients 
with atypical speech patterns performed more poorly than the "left-hemisphere" pa- 
tients on nonverbal tasks. It appeared that transfer of language "crowded out" func- 
tions normally under mandate of the right hemisphere. Thus, a right-left maturation 
gradient, characterized by a slower development of the right than the left hemisphere, 
might permit the still more plastic right hemisphere to assume language functions, but 
not without disturbing the typical organization of right-hemisphere functions. 
Amobarbital studies of patients with epilepsy have also challenged the notion that 
hemispheric language dominance falls into discrete categories. Rather, it is more likely 
that language representation falls on a continuum from strongly left-hemisphere dom- 
inant to strongly right-hemisphere dominant, just as handedness seems to fall on a 
continuum from strongly dextral to strongly sinistral (Loring, Meador, Lee, Murro, et 
al., 1990; Snyder et al., 1990). Kurthen et al. (1994), however, offer data suggesting 
that cases might not fall along all points of such a continuum. Specifically, these 
authors proposed that there are four major patterns of hemispheric speech represen- 
tation. Toward the left-dominant end of the spectrum, there are indeed several clusters 
representing degrees of left speech dominance. However, individuals with bilateral or 
right speech dominance tended to center at these respective points, without the gra- 
dation observed for left-hemisphere representation. 
Amobarbital studies have also indicated that crossed aphasia (the occurrence of 
aphasia in right-handed individuals after insult to the right hemisphere) should not 
necessarily be taken to imply right-hemispheric language dominance in these right- 
banders. Both Lanoe, et al. (1992) and Loring, Meador, Lee, Flanigin, et al. (1990) 
determined via ISA that their patients with crossed aphasia actually had bilateral lan- 
guage representation. 

202 
Julie A. Fields and Alexander I. TriJster 
12-7.2. Bilingualism and Sign Language 
Several studies have shown that the interhemispheric organization of both languages 
in bilinguals is complementary, that is, hemispheric dominance for the two languages 
is similar (Berthier, Starkstein, Lylyk, & Leiguarda, 1990; Gomez-Tortosa, Martin, 
Gaviria, Charbel, & Ausman, 1995). However, the intrahemispheric organization of 
the native and second language is likely different. Berthier et al. (1990), on the basis 
of the observation that the patient's second language recovered before the native lan- 
guage after left middle cerebral artery amobarbital injection, speculated that the second 
language might be organized within the central sylvian core, whereas the first language 
might be represented in more distant perisylvian areas. One might, however, find a 
diametrically opposing interpretation more plausible. Electrical stimulation studies (for 
review, see Ojemann, 1983) confirm that at least object naming in first and second 
languages is differentially represented within the language-dominant hemisphere, with 
the second language being represented in a larger area, more peripheral from the 
sylvian fissure. Thus, one might conclude, assuming that amobarbital effects dissipate 
earlier in more distant areas, that Berthier et al.'s (1990) findings indicate the first 
language to be more centrally represented. 
Sign language studies in nondeaf individuals also indicate interhemispheric organ- 
ization of signed and spoken language to be similar, at least in that the same hemi- 
sphere is dominant for both forms of communication. The existence of subtle inter- 
hemispheric differences in the organization of signed and spoken language, however, 
is not settled by amobarbital studies. One amobarbital study lends support to Poizner 
and Battison's (1980) contention that sign language is characterized by greater bilateral 
representation than spoken language. Homan, Criswell, Wada, and Ross (1982), in a 
right-handed male who had learned speech and signing at the same time, found that 
hemispheric dominance for speech and signing were the same (left). However, later- 
alization for signing was not as strong as for speech, in that the right hemisphere also 
contributed to the propositional and emotional components of signing. In contrast, 
other studies have found the interhemispheric organization of signed and spoken lan- 
guage to be highly similar. Mateer, Rapport, and Kettrick (1984), in a left-hander, 
found similar mixed dominance for both spoken and signed language. Whereas 
right-hemisphere ISA disrupted motoric aspects of both languages, left ISA disrupted 
grammar and semantic usage in both languages. Damasio, Bellugi, Damasio, Poizner, 
and VanGilder (1986) found that left ISA in a right-handed individual led to marked 
aphasia for both American Sign Language (ASL) and spoken English, and that right 
temporal lobectomy left ASL and English unperturbed. 
Because a substantial proportion of deaf individuals apparently have experienced 
some cortical reorganization, Wolff, Sass, and Keidan's (1994) report of ISA test 
results in a deaf individual are of particular significance. Their study provides tentative 
data about whether findings from normal-hearing individuals concerning the organi- 
zation of sign language apply to deaf individuals. Wolff et al. (1994) reported complete 
left-hemispheric dominance in a right-handed individual for ASL, signed English, and 
finger spelling. Thus, these authors did not find evidence of bilateral representation 
for sign language.

12-8. SUMMARY 
The ISA has been shown to be a reliable and valid method of determining hemispheric 
language dominance in the hands of skilled clinicians. Results from electrical mapping 
of cortical language areas, as well as from functional MRI, support the concurrent 
validity of the ISA. Although the ISA's predictive validity is established since early 
studies, the question has been raised whether postoperative language outcome is dif- 
ferent in individuals undergoing language-dominant temporal lobectomy with and 
without cortical mapping. The answer appears to be that a small subgroup of patients 
not undergoing language mapping might develop a dysnomia, the persistence of which 
has not yet been documented. 
Lack of uniformity of test protocols across centers makes it difficult to compare 
research findings from different centers. However, drug administration variables, the 
criteria used to define adequate anesthesia and hemispheric language dominance, and 
individual differences in cerebral drug distribution are important considerations in 
interpreting ISA results. 
The ISA has also advanced our understanding of the relationship between hemi- 
spheric language dominance and handedness: age at injury, as well as the injury's 
extent and location influence whether language dominance and handedness will be 
reorganized inter- or intrahemispherically. Interhemispheric reorganization of language 
is more likely to occur before age 6, and such reorganization might exact a cost on 
nonverbal functions (i.e., "crowd" these functions). Amobarbital studies have also 
been helpful in demonstrating the generally complementary cerebral organization pat- 
terns of first and second languages in bilinguals, and of signed and spoken language.

Phonetics and Phonology 
Jackson T. Gandour 
Department of Audiology and Speech Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907 
Phonological and phonetic studies of aphasia are evaluated with respect to issues 
of neural representation of speech and language. The traditional dichotomy be- 
tween anterior and posterior syndromes has been challenged in recent years. In 
speech production, deficits at the phonological level are discussed in relation to 
psycholinguistic models of speech production, phonological features, underspe- 
cification, markedness, syllable structure, and sonority. Segmental deficits at the 
phonetic level are discussed primarily in relation to temporal parameters of con- 
sonants and vowels, segmental coarticulation, and speaking rate effects. The data 
challenge the traditional view that articulatory implementation deficits are cir- 
cumscribed to anterior lesions, planning deficits to posterior lesions. Hemispheric 
specialization is assessed for linguistic aspects of prosody and brought to bear on 
a number of competing hypotheses. Production deficits are examined for pho- 
nemic stress, contrastive stress, lexical tones, tonal coarticulation, intonation, and 
foreign accent syndrome. The bulk of the evidence suggests minimal involvement 
of the right hemisphere in mediating linguistic prosody. In speech perception, the

(e.g., Caplan, 1992; Kohn, 1993; Levelt, 1989, and references therein). Much of the 
evidence in support of this functional architecture comes from in-depth case studies 
of aphasic patients. However, there is some disagreement over details of mechanisms 
(Buckingham, 1992), and some even question the validity of the research paradigm 
itself (Butterworth, 1992). 
The traditional dichotomy between anterior and posterior aphasia syndromes has 
been challenged in recent years. Much of the data to support alternative models of 
language specialization in the brain has come from the area of speech production. The 
neural representation of speech motor control is perhaps more diffusely represented 
than heretofore believed. 
The majority of the experimental studies covered in this review have used the terms 
"Broca's aphasia" and "apraxia of speech" more or less synonymously, so we will 
not be able to determine whether any differences in articulatory deficits are to be 
ascribed to these two diagnostic categories (Blumstein, 1994; Kohn, 1993). 
This chapter will focus on topics of theoretical interest since 1990 in the realm of 
phonetics and phonology, especially various aspects of prosody. Excellent reviews of 
earlier work in phonetics and phonology are readily available (Blumstein, 1990, 1991, 
1994; Ryalls, 1987a; Whitaker, 1988). 
13-1. SPEECH PRODUCTION 
13-1.1. Deficits at the Phonological Level 
Nearly all aphasic patients produce phonological errors in their speech output. All 
types of phonological errors can be found across diagnostic categories of aphasia (see 
Blumstein, 1990, 1991, 1994, for reviews and references therein). Kohn (1993) has 
argued that when differences in experimental tasks, stimuli, and linguistic analyses 
are taken into account, it is possible to distinguish the phonological output behavior 
of different aphasia syndromes by means of analysis of their phonological errors (see 
Butterworth, 1992, for detailed criticism). 
Segmental error patterns reflect disruption at different stages of speech production 
that may be associated with different aphasic syndromes (see Kohn, 1993, for review). 
Wernicke's aphasics' difficulties stem primarily from impaired access to underlying 
phonological representations (stage 1); conduction aphasics, on the other hand, have 
problems primarily in constructing the phonemic representations (stage 2; cf. B61and, 
Caplan, & Nespoulous, 1990); whereas the error patterns of Broca's aphasics reflect 
primarily a phonetic disturbance (stage 3). Various psycholinguistic mechanisms have 
been hypothesized to account for phonemic paraphasias at stage 2 (see Buckingham, 
1992, for extended discussion). 
A few studies have focused on phonological errors that occur in the context of 
multiple repeated attempts at a single target word (conduite d'approche). The succes- 
sive approximations of conduction aphasics show a tendency of steady progression 
toward the target, which supports the notion that they suffer from a stage 2 deficit

(Gandour, Akamanon, Dechongkit, Khunadorn, & Boonklam, 1994; Kohn, 1989; Val- 
dois, Joanette, & Nespoulous, 1989). In contrast, the error sequences of Wernicke's 
aphasics actually deteriorate from the intial to the final attempt, linking their segmental 
errors to a lexical problem or stage 1 deficit. 
13-1.1.1. Phonological Features and Underspecification Theory 
Recent theories of generative phonology posit that features are organized in a hier- 
archical tree structure (see Halle, 1992, and references therein). Blumstein (1990) 
found that the majority of phoneme substitution errors reflect feature changes within 
a single tier rather than across tiers. Evidence for an independent laryngeal tier has 
been shown in aphasia (Dogil, 1989; Dogil, Hildebrandt, & Schfirmeier, 1990; Gan- 
dour, Holasuit Petty, & Dardarananda, 1989; Gandour, Akamanon, et al., 1994). 
Theories of underspecification have been proposed that aim to explain when fea- 
tures may be absent in underlying or derived representations (see Steriade, 1995, for 
review). B61and et al. (1990) showed how phonemic errors made by a conduction 
aphasic are related to syllabification processes that interact with underspecified seg- 
mental representations at different stages in phonological encoding. An analysis of 
phonemic paraphasias in French-speaking aphasics supported the underspecified nature 
of coronal consonants (B61and & Favreau, 1991). Underspecification theory has also 
been applied to predict the location and quality of epenthetic vowels in phonemic 
paraphasias produced by French-speaking aphasics (B61and, 1990). 
13-1.1.2. Markedness 
It has been argued that markedness theory can explain the pattern of phonemic par- 
aphasias in aphasia. Among other criteria, "marked" segments are considered to be 
more complex articulatorily and universally rarer than "unmarked" segments. Sub- 
stitution errors of aphasic patients have been observed to involve replacement of 
marked segments with unmarked ones (see Blumstein, 1990, 1991, for review and 
references therein). The pattern of phonemic paraphasias was indistinguishable across 
clinical syndromes. More recent work, however, has challenged the unitary treatment 
of different aphasic syndromes as well as the claim that markedness considerations 
play a critical role in accounting for the error patterns (B61and et al., 1990). 
13-1.1.3. Syllable Structure 
Recent theories of phonology recognize the syllable as a phonological constituent (see 
Blevins, 1995, for review). Phonemic substitution errors appear to be sensitive to 
syllable-internal hierarchical branching structure. Few substitutions occur when the 
consonant is part of a consonant cluster (see Blumstein, 1990, for review). The ma- 
jority of consonant substitution errors occur when the consonant is preceded or fol- 
lowed by a vowel. These findings are inexplicable in a theoretical framework that 
treats the syllable as an unanalyzable whole. Analyses of phonemic paraphasias across 

210 
Jackson T. Gandour 
word boundaries show that the affected phonemes occur in like syllable positions (e.g., 
onset, nucleus, coda). Not all constituents of the syllable are equally prone to disrup- 
tion. An analysis of neologistic jargon produced by two Wernicke's aphasics revealed 
that the coda is more susceptible to impairment than the onset; the nucleus is the most 
stable of the syllable-internal constituents (Stark & Stark, 1990). 
Kaye, Lowenstamm, and Vergnaud's (1985) theory of phonological government 
distinguishes two types of consonant clusters that have different syllabic representa- 
tions and are characterized by different governing domains. Valdois (1990) found that 
aphasic errors support the claim that obstruent-liquid clusters and other cluster types 
have different syllabic representations and, moreover, suggest that segments in the 
governed position are more likely to be involved in the destruction or creation of 
clusters than segments in the governing position. 
13-1.1.4. Sonority 
Sonority refers to the perceptual prominence of one phoneme relative to another. 
Along a sonority scale, obstruents are considered to be the least sonorous, vowels the 
most sonorous. The sonority sequencing principle holds that segments are optimally 
ordered so as to achieve a rise-fall sonority profile: an increase in sonority from the 
beginning of the syllable to the vowel peak followed by decrease in sonority from the 
vowel peak out to the end of the syllable. Sonority sequencing principles have been 
invoked to explain phonological error patterns frequently seen in fluent aphasia, es- 
pecially in neologistic jargonaphasia (see Christman, 1994, and references therein). 
13-1.2. Deficits at the Phonetic Level 
The traditional view is that anterior aphasics have a tendency to produce phonetic 
errors; posterior aphasics have difficulty primarily at the phonological level. The un- 
derlying cause of the phonetic errors has usually been attributed to a breakdown in 
articulatory implementation, whereas phonemic errors have been ascribed to a break- 
down in access or planning the appropriate phonological output (Blumstein, 1990, 
1991, 1994; see Ryalls, 1987a, for reviews of the earlier literature on phonetic patterns 
of dissolution in aphasia). 
13-1.2.1. Temporal Parameters of Consonant and Vowel Production 
Acoustic, physiological, and perceptual investigations of consonant production deficits 
in aphasia support a dichotomy between phonological planning and phonetic imple- 
mentation (see Blumstein, 1990, 1994; see Blumstein & Baum, 1987, for reviews and 
references therein). Anterior aphasics exhibit primarily deficiencies in articulatory im- 
plementation, whereas the consonant production deficits of posterior aphasics gener- 
ally reflect problems of a phonological nature. Anterior aphasics' difficulties do not 
lie with particular phonetic features. The "voicing" feature provides a case in point. 
In English, this feature is associated with word-initial stop and fricative consonants 

13 
Phonetics and Phonology 
211 
as well as vowel duration as a cue to postvocalic voicing in stop consonants. Results 
indicated that voicing in initial stops and fricatives was impaired, whereas vowel 
duration was relatively spared (Baum, Blumstein, Naeser, & Palumbo, 1990; Baum, 
1996). 
Crosslinguistic comparisons have reinforced the notion that the phonological status 
of the durational attribute has little effect on speech production impairments of anterior 
aphasics. For example, Blumstein, Cooper, Goodglass, Statlender, and Gottlieb's 
(1980) seminal findings on voice onset time (VOT) in word-initial stop consonants 
have been replicated in many other languages. There is a marked compression of the 
VOT continuum regardless of the number of stop voicing categories that are present 
in the phonological system (Gandour et al., 1992b). Conversely, vowel duration at the 
syllable level appears to be relatively spared following brain damage regardless of 
whether it is used contrastively at the lexical level (Baum et al., 1990; Gandour et al., 
1992c). 
Besides an impairment in the timing of independent articulators, anterior aphasics 
may have difficulties with the implementation of laryngeal gestures that closely in- 
teract with the supralaryngeal vocal tract system (Blumstein, 1990, 1991, 1994). In 
contrast, laryngeal gestures that may be implemented independently of the supralaryn- 
geal tract appear to be relatively spared. Indeed, it is argued that disruption of laryn- 
geal gestures is a secondary manifestation of a more general timing disorder (Danly 
& Shapiro, 1982; Gandour, 1987). Nevertheless, a patient who exhibited a dissociation 
between oral and laryngeal gestures has been described by Marshall, Gandour, and 
Windsor (1988). 
Other work, however, has challenged the notion that the timing disorder is restricted 
to instances of temporal integration or coordination between two independent articu- 
lators. Ryalls (1987b) concluded that the degree of disturbance of vowel duration in 
aphasia varies depending on the size of the linguistic unit within which vowels are 
produced. Baum (1992) similarly reported that anterior aphasics fail to reduce the root 
syllable duration in longer words at the same magnitude as normals. An inability to 
increase speaking rate in longer, multisyllabic utterances may underlie these timing 
abnormalities (Baum, 1993; Baum & Ryan, 1993). Gandour et al. (1992c; Gandour, 
Dechongkit, Ponglorpisit, Khunadorn, & Boongird, 1993; Gandour, Dechongkit, Pon- 
glorpisit, & Khundorn, 1994) found that anterior aphasics, in contrast to posterior 
aphasics, exhibit a deterioration in speech timing regardless of the size of the linguistic 
unit. The fact that temporal patterns of dissolution are not the same across multiple 
tasks of varying length and linguistic complexity suggests that their timing deficit 
emanates from different underlying mechanisms. 
13-1.2.2. Segmental Coarticulation 
The study of coarticulation provides insights into the size of the planning units that 
can be programmed in the production of syllables and words as well as the dynamic 
aspects of speech production. Acoustic, physiological, and perceptual investigations 
of coarticulatory phenomena involving consonants and vowels present mixed findings 

212 
Jackson T. Gandour 
on the issue of mechanisms underlying any coarticulatory deficits in brain-damaged 
patients (see Katz, Machetanz, Orth, & Sch6nle, 1990a, for review of earlier studies). 
Katz (1988) found no evidence of a deficit in anticipatory coarticulation in anterior 
and posterior aphasic English-speaking patients. Anticipatory labial coarticulation was 
also found to be essentially intact in two German-speaking anterior aphasics (Katz. 
Machetanz, Orth, & Sch6nle, 1990a, 1990b). In contrast, anticipatory coarticulation 
was found to be disturbed in two English-speaking apraxic patients as well as one of 
two conduction aphasics (McNeil, Hashi, & Southwood, 1994). It is possible that 
these conflicting findings might be due to individual subject differences, to problems 
of taxonomic classification, or to differences in measurement methods--acoustic, kine- 
matic, or perceptual (see Katz, 1988; Katz et al., 1990a, for detailed discussion). 
13-1.2.3. Speaking Rate Effects 
Another interesting aspect of temporal control is the manipulation of speaking rate 
and its effects on segmental and suprasegmental production. Although their changes 
in rate were of smaller magnitude than those for normal subjects, both anterior and 
posterior patients appear to be relatively unimpaired in their ability to manipulate 
speaking rate (Baum, 1993, 1996; Baum & Ryan, 1993; McNeil, Liss, Tseng, & Kent, 
1990). Yet temporal deficit patterns between speaking rate conditions are not the same 
for anterior and posterior patients. For example, vowel durations of nonfluent aphasics 
were not significantly different between slow and fast conditions (Baum, 1993). In 
contrast, fluent aphasics, like normal subjects, produced shorter vowel durations at a 
faster speaking rate. The emergence of these differences in performance at the seg- 
mental level suppports the view that distinct impairments underlie the anterior and 
posterior patients' temporal deficits. 
13-1.2.4. Subtle Phonetic Deficit in Posterior Aphasics 
Acoustic, physiological, and perceptual studies over the past decade and a half or so 
have reported instances of a "subtle phonetic deficit" in left hemisphere-damaged 
(LHD) patients with posterior lesions (see Vijayan & Gandour, 1995, for review and 
references therein). These data challenge the traditional view that articulatory imple- 
mentation deficits are circumscribed to anterior lesions, planning deficits to posterior 
lesions. Although the speech-production difficulties of posterior patients seem to be 
primarily phonological in nature, it is claimed that they also display "phonetic im- 
pairments [that] are not clinically perceptible but emerge only upon acoustic analysis" 
(Blumstein, 1994, p. 32). Acoustic analysis of phoneme errors made by a conduction 
aphasic, however, has revealed that most perceived phoneme substitutions exhibited 
acoustic characteristics appropriate to the substituted sound, and thus most likely 
reflect true phoneme selection errors (Baum & Slatkovsky, 1993). 
Timing deficits in LHD posterior patients have been attributed to a subtle phonetic 
impairment (Baum, 1996; Baum et al., 1990; Blumstein et al., 1980; McNeill et al., 
1990). These deficits, however, are not necessarily the same in anterior and posterior 

13 
Phonetics and Phonology 
213 
patients. Whereas anterior patients experienced timing difficulties at the syllable, word, 
and sentence levels, posterior aphasics exhibited normal-like timing in isolated mon- 
osyllables, but had deviant timing patterns for longer words and sentences (Gandour 
et al., 1992b, 1992c; Gandour, Dechongkit, et al., 1993; Gandour, Dechongkit, 
Ponglorpisit, et al., 1994). Yet acoustic analysis has revealed that anticipatory and 
perseverative tonal coarticulation were disturbed in LHD posterior patients as well as 
anterior patients (Gandour, Potisuk, Ponglorpisit, Dechongkit, et al., 1996). 
13-1.3. Deficits in Speech Prosody 
It is well known that speech prosody can can be used to signal linguistic and emotional 
information (see Van Lancker & Pachana, this volume, for discussion of emotional or 
affective prosody; see Weniger, 1993, for earlier review of disorders of prosody in 
aphasia). A number of competing hypotheses have been proposed to account for the 
lateralization of linguistic prosody. The "functional load" hypothesis states that pro- 
sodic cues are processed differently in the left hemisphere depending on whether they 
serve a linguistic or a nonlinguistic function (Van Lancker, 1980). A more restrictive 
version of this hypothesis stipulates that the left hemisphere is specifically engaged 
for lexical contrasts (Packard, 1986). The "parallel processing" hypothesis posits that 
both hemispheres may simultaneously participate in processing various components 
of the speech signal for which the hemisphere is specialized. The left hemisphere has 
been hypothesized to mediate temporal information, the right hemisphere spectral 
information (Robin, Tranel, & Damasio, 1990; Robin, Klouda, & Hug, 1991; Van 
Lancker & Sidtis, 1992). The "attraction hypothesis" (Shipley-Brown, Dingwall, Ber- 
lin, Yeni-Komshian, & Gordon-Salant, 1988) states that differential lateralization oc- 
curs as a result of an interaction between the acoustic property and its function. F0 
may be mediated by the right hemisphere in nonlinguistic functions, but may be 
"drawn" to the left hemisphere when it is used to signal linguistic prosody. As a 
corollary to the attraction hypothesis, Behrens (1988, 1989) has emphasized that size 
of the utterance or task demands influences the lateralization of linguistic prosody. 
13-1.3.1. Stress 
Stress is especially interesting for testing hypotheses about hemispheric specialization 
of prosody because of its multiple acoustic correlates: duration, amplitude, and F0. An 
across-the-board deficit in all three acoustic correlates would imply a functional level 
disturbance at high level of linguistic representation. Selective deficits in any one or 
more of these multiple correlates, on the other hand, would suggest that there may be 
differential lateralization for the processing of different prosodic parameters. Acoustic 
investigations of LHD and right hemisphere-damaged (RHD) patients' ability to pro- 
duce lexical and phrasal stress contrasts have generally found a stress deficit in LHD 
patients only (Emmorey, 1987; Behrens, 1988; Ouellette & Baum, 1994; Bryan, 
1989). Instead of characterizing the deficit as a stress deficit, LHD patients appear to 
have difficulty with the manipulation of durational cues, whereas the other acoustic 

214 
Jackson T. Gandour 
correlates of stress remain relatively intact (Ouellette & Baum, 1994; Emmorey, 1987). 
Ouellette and Baum's findings lend support to the hypothesis of differential laterali- 
zation for the processing of different acoustic parameters. It is possible that deficits 
in the processing of linguistic prosody attributed to LHD patients may be a secondary 
consequence of a more basic impairment in speech timing. This finding is consistent 
with previous acoustic investigations of other aspects of speech prosody (Danly & 
Shapiro, 1982; Gandour et al., 1989). The isolated impairment of duration as a cue 
to prosody in LHD patients further suggests that the primary deficit may not neces- 
sarily be restricted to the prosodic domain. 
Acoustic investigations of contrastive stress have similarly reported impaired pro- 
cessing mechanisms for LHD patients only (Behrens, 1988; Ouellette & Baum, 1994). 
Using the same subjects as in the phonemic stress experiment, Ouellette and Baum's 
finding of a selective deficit in durational cues associated with contrastive stress re- 
inforces the view that the timing deficit cuts across various linguistic representations 
irrespective of the size of the linguistic domain. For lexical or phrasal stress, planning 
involved only one lexical unit or a short phrase; for contrastive stress, planning in- 
volved a sentence-length unit. These findings are in apparent conflict with earlier 
claims that the stability of acoustic patterns in the speech of brain-damaged patients 
depend primarily on the size of the temporal domain over which the linguistic unit is 
programmed (Behrens, 1989; Gandour et al., 1989; Gandour, Dechongkit, et al., 1993; 
Gandour et al., 1996). 
13-1.3.2. Tone 
Tones, like consonants and vowels, may be disrupted secondary to left hemisphere 
damage (see Gandour, 1987, in press, for earlier review). Tonal paraphasias, like con- 
sonant and vowel paraphasias, are in evidence across tone languages (see Gandour, in 
press, for review). It has been argued that tonal paraphasias are phonologically equiv- 
alent to consonant and vowel paraphasias (Packard, 1986). This hypothesis is difficult 
to reconcile with findings that tones were corrected earlier than either consonants or 
vowels in sequences of phonemic approximations (Gandour, Akamanon, et al., 1994), 
and were preserved in the running speech of a Broca's aphasic despite disruption of 
consonants and vowels (Gandour et al., 1989). 
Although tonal breakdown has been observed in Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, 
and Thai (see Gandour, in press, and references therein), variability in the magnitude 
of the deficit appears to be related primarily to aphasia severity and time since onset 
of the stroke (Gandour et al., 1992a; Yiu & Fok, 1995). Nonfluent aphasics generally 
experience more difficulty in tonal production than fluent aphasics. 
Tonal production, however, appears to be spared following unilateral lesions to the 
right hemisphere (Gandour et al., 1992a; Hughes, Chan, & Ming, 1983). Tones may 
also be disrupted subsequent to a left-hemisphere subcortical lesion (Gandour & 
Ponglorpisit, 1990). In Norwegian, a pitch accent language, findings similarly support 
the view that linguistically significant F0 contrasts are mediated by the left hemisphere 
(Ryalls & Reinvang, 1986; Moen & Sunder, 1996). 

13 
Phonetics and Phonology 
215 
There is some evidence for a selective deficit of types of tones based on articulatory 
complexity. In Mandarin Chinese, Tone 3, a tone with a complex rising F0 contour, 
was especially vulnerable to disruption (Packard, 1986). In Thai, almost all tonal 
substitutions resulted in a mid, low, or falling tone (Gandour et al., 1992a). These 
findings are compatible with the notion that rising tones are more complex articula- 
torily than falling tones. Yet errors appear to be evenly distributed across the six lexical 
tones of Cantonese (Yiu & Fok, 1995). 
13-1.3.3. Tonal Coarticulation 
Anticipatory tonal coarticulation in Thai bisyllabic noun compounds was found to be 
essentially intact in both LHD and RHD patients (Gandour, Ponglorpisit, et al., 1993). 
Using the same subjects, Gandour et al. (1996) found that anticipatory and persev- 
erative tonal coarticulation was disturbed in longer sentence contexts in both anterior 
and posterior aphasics. Tonal coarticulation was absent in the former, markedly re- 
duced in magnitude and temporal extent in the latter. Coarticulatory effects in RHD 
patients, on the other hand, were indistinguishable from those of normal controls. 
Together, these findings suggest that the planning of tonal coarticulation may deteri- 
orate in longer sentence contexts in the speech of LHD patients. Like consonants and 
vowels, some deficiencies are observed in the coarticulation of tones. 
13-1.3.4. Intonation 
Contrary to the view that all aspects of prosody are mediated by the right hemisphere, 
much of the acoustic phonetic evidence seems to indicate that intonation is more 
vulnerable to disruption in the speech of LHD than RHD patients (see Cooper & 
Klouda, 1987, and Ryalls & Behrens, 1988, for earlier reviews). Although the deficit 
is more severe in Broca's aphasics (Danly & Shapiro, 1982), abnormalities in into- 
national patterns have also been observed in Wernicke's aphasics (Danly, Cooper, & 
Shapiro, 1983). Not all aspects of intonation are vulnerable to impairment; for ex- 
ample, the sentence-final fall in F0 (Danly & Shapiro, 1982). 
The extent to which sentence declination patterns deviate from those of normals 
appears to depend largely on the size of the utterance (Cooper, Soares, Nicol, Mich- 
elow, & Goloskie, 1984; Danly & Shapiro, 1982). Declination patterns were more 
likely to deteriorate in longer sentences. A narrowing of the Fo range that has been 
observed in anterior LHD patients of nontone languages (Cooper et al., 1984) does 
not generalize to tone languages. Not only is there no compression of the F0 range in 
Thai-speaking aphasics (Gandour et al., 1992a), but their tone space actually has a 
wider than normal range. An intonation deficit in the speech of a nonfluent Chinese- 
speaking aphasic appears to be a secondary manifestation of a more pervasive timing 
disorder (Packard, 1993). 
These crosslinguistic findings suggest that disturbances in Fo patterns in aphasic 
patients may be a secondary consequence of an underlying timing impairment (Danly 
& Shapiro, 1982; Cooper & Klouda, 1987; Gandour, 1987). Consistent with this 

216 
Jackson T. Gandour 
hypothesis, a Thai-speaking Broca's aphasic exhibited aberrant timing at the sentence 
level in tandem with preserved F0 contours of the five tones (Gandour et al., 1989; 
cf. Moen, 1991). 
The right hemisphere may be implicated in the control of global aspects of sentence 
intonation (see Ryalls & Behrens, 1988, for review of earlier studies). Baum and Pell 
(1997), however, found intonational characteristics to be spared in RHD patients as 
well as LHD patients, leading them to conclude that some aspects of intonation may 
be under the control of subcortical structures. Gandour (1995) and Gandour et al. (in 
press) similarly found certain aspects of intonation to be spared in LHD and RHD 
Thai-speaking patients. 
Yet, the evidence seems to support the notion that the right hemisphere modulates 
dominantly the graded, affective components of language. All patients manifested a 
dense, nonfluent aphasia during the left-sided Wada test (Ross, Edmondson, Seibert, 
& Homan, 1988); during the right-sided Wada test, they exhibited a severe to mod- 
erately severe flattening of spontaneous speech. In a pre- and poststroke comparison, 
Blonder, Pickering, Heath, Smith, and Butler (1995) similarly found their RHD patient 
to exhibit a more restricted variability in F0 and pause duration during spontaneous 
speech 6 weeks after the stroke, leading them to suggest that gradient properties of 
intonation are disrupted in RHD patients. 
13-1.3.5. Foreign Accent Syndrome 
The foreign accent syndrome (FAS) is a rare speech disorder that is characterized by 
the emergence of a perceived foreign accent in speech following left hemisphere brain 
damage (Blumstein, Alexander, Ryalls, Katz, & Dworetzky, 1987; Kurowski, Blum- 
stein, & Alexander, 1996, and references therein). Blumstein et al. hypothesized that 
acoustically anomalous features are linked to a common underlying deficit relating to 
speech prosody. Prosodic impairments, however, were minimal in Kurowski et al.'s 
(1996) patient, leading them to challenge the notion that a general prosodic disturbance 
is the sole underlying mechanism in FAS. It has proved to be very difficult to deter- 
mine what constellation of phonetic features typically characterizes FAS. 
13-2. SPEECH 
PERCEPTION 
Much of the earlier literature on speech perception attempted to determine whether 
segmental or phonemic perception is impaired in aphasia and whether such perceptual 
deficits underlie auditory language comprehension deficits (see Blumstein, 1991, 1994, 
for reviews). These findings suggest that aphasic patients do suffer from deficits in 
processing segmental contrasts, yet surprisingly, neither speech perception deficits nor 
auditory deficits appear to underlie language comprehension impairments. More recent 
work has attempted to show how the interaction between the phonetic features and 
the lexicon could ultimately contribute to deficits in language comprehension. 

13 
Phonetics and Phonology 
217 
13-2.1. Role of Phonology in Lexical Access 
Milberg, Blumstein, and Dworetzky (1988) investigated the extent to which phono- 
logical distortions affect semantic facilitation in a lexical decision task. Anterior apha- 
sics showed semantic facilitation only in the undistorted real word condition, but not 
in the phonologically distorted, nonword conditions; in contrast, posterior aphasics 
showed facilitation in all phonologically distorted, nonword conditions at a level 
equivalent to that in the undistorted real word condition. These findings suggest that 
anterior aphasics have a higher threshold for lexical access, whereas posterior aphasics 
have a lower threshold (Gordon & Baum, 1994). 
Similarly, the lexical status of a word has been shown to differentially affect how 
aphasic patients perform phonetic categorization (Blumstein, Burton, Baum, Wald- 
stein, & Katz, 1994). Blumstein et al. found that anterior aphasics showed a larger- 
than-normal lexical effect, whereas posterior aphasics showed no lexical effect. Their 
findings suggest that anterior aphasics place a greater reliance on the lexical status of 
the stimulus in making their phonetic decisions than on the perceptual information in 
the stimulus. In contrast, posterior aphasics appear to be unable to use lexically based 
heuristic strategies in phonetic categorization. 
13-2.2. Deficits in Perception of Speech Prosody 
13-2.2.1. Stress 
The perception of lexical, phrasal, emphatic, as well as sentence-level stress contrasts 
appears to be more disturbed following left-hemisphere than right-hemisphere damage 
(Emmorey, 1987, and references therein; Bryan, 1989). Across studies, no differences 
have been reported between the performance of anterior and posterior aphasics. 
13-2.2.2. Intonation 
The role of the left and right hemispheres in the processing of intonation contours is 
much less clear. Several perceptual studies have argued in favor of the notion that the 
right hemisphere is dominant for processing the acoustic correlates of sentence into- 
nation (Shipley-Brown et al., 1988, and references therein). These findings have gen- 
erally been interpreted to support the parallel processing hypothesis. Perkins, Baran, 
and Gandour's (1996) findings support the functional load or attraction hypothesis. 
When unfiltered pitch contours were presented for identification in a linguistic con- 
text, RHD patients performed better than LHD patients. Conversely, when filtered 
pitch contours were presented for discrimination in a nonlinguistic context, LHD 
patients performed better than RHD patients. And finally, when unfiltered pitch con- 
tours were presented for discrimination, a task that allowed for either linguistic or 
nonlinguistic processing, no differences in performance emerged between LHD and 
RHD patients.

13-2.2.3. Tone 
Crosslinguistic findings from perceptual investigations of LHD and RHD patients who 
are speakers of tone languages consistently point to the left hemisphere as dominant 
for the perception of lexical tones: Mandarin Chinese (Hughes et al., 1983), Cantonese 
(Yiu & Fok, 1995), Thai (Gandour & Dardarananda, 1983), Toisanese Chinese (Eng, 
Obler, Harris, & Abramson, in press). The left hemisphere also emerges as the dom- 
inant hemisphere for the perception of pitch accent distinctions (Moen & Sundet, 
1996). Those tones that are most susceptible to perceptual confusion are precisely 
those that are phonetically similar in height and shape to others in the tone space. 
Dichotic listening studies have similarly indicated left-hemisphere specialization for 
the perception of lexical tones and pitch accents (Van Lancker & Fromkin, 1973; 
Moen, 1993). 
13-3. CONCLUSION 
Phonological analyses of aphasic production data generally confirm recent proposals 
for features, syllable structures, and underspecified representations. Similarly, these 
analyses support psycholinguistic models of speech production that allow for three 
stages of phonological encoding: access, planning, and implementation. Such analyses, 
however, are scarce, and limited to only a few patients. It remains to be determined 
whether or not these findings can be generalized to clinical populations at large. If 
not, it is possible that "idiosyncratic preferences reflect the functioning of backup 
systems rather than the normal systems themselves" (Butterworth, 1992, p. 283). 
Aphasic data also suggests that the phonological/phonetic components of the gram- 
mar may be more diffusely represented in the language-dominant hemisphere than 
heretofore believed. Phonetic evidence clearly points to a temporal deficit in speech 
production subsequent to left-hemisphere lesions, though the exact nature of the timing 
disorder remains an empirical question. New experimental designs that incorporate 
multiple tasks of varying type and complexity with the same patients should help to 
clarify whether the subclinical disturbances observed in posterior patients are due to 
a breakdown in phonetics or something else. 
Not all aspects of linguistic prosody are subject to disruption following unilateral 
lesions to the left hemisphere. Therefore, the term "dysprosody" is an invalid label 
for characterizing the phenomenon. The deficit does not appear to reside at a linguistic 
level. Instead, evidence appears to weigh in favor of hypotheses that allow for dif- 
ferential lateralization of prosodic cues. One hypothesis that is deserving of further 
investigation is that timing impairments underlie suprasegmental as well as segmental 
deficits. In this way, it may be possible to achieve a unitary account of speech pro- 
duction disorders in LHD patients. Although the issue has not been resolved conclu- 
sively, the bulk of the evidence suggests minimal involvement of the right hemisphere 
in mediating linguistic prosody. 
As is the case with segmental contrasts, anterior and posterior LHD patients suffer 
a perceptual deficit in prosodic contrasts. RHD patients, on the other hand, are gen- 

13

erally spared in the perception of linguistic prosody. The attraction hypothesis seems 
to best account for the disparate array of findings in perceptual studies of stress, tone, 
and intonation. Impairments in the use of phonological information to access the 
lexicon appear to underlie at least some of the deficits in auditory language compre- 
hension. The relationship between perception and production in aphasia remains 
unclear.

The purpose of this chapter is to characterize the breakdown of morphology in 
the performance of aphasic subjects in sentence and in single-word processing. 
Evidence from an array of languages investigated within a unilingual or cross- 
linguistic approach is presented and several recent interpretations are reviewed. 
It will be argued that the introduction of theoretical linguistic and psycholin- 
guistic considerations into the study of aphasia contributes to a better under- 
standing of the way in which pathology affects the morphological component of 
language. 
In this chapter, we will consider disturbances affecting the morphological structure of 
words in aphasia. Disorders of morphologically complex, or multimorphemic, words 
have been reported to exist in the production and comprehension of aphasic subjects, 
at both the sentence and the single-word levels. We will discuss morphological im- 
pairments during sentence generation, as well as in single-word processing. Our effort 
will be to characterize the nature of these impairments, drawing on research that relies 
on a variety of tasks and languages and that shows a growing interest in theoretical 
linguistic models of word formation and psycholinguistic models of lexical processing. 
We will cite only a limited number of the many studies that have reported on the

various forms of morphological disturbances in aphasia over the last two decades. 
Overall, they have provided converging evidence for the following assumptions: 
1. Single-word processing disturbances can dissociate from morphological 
breakdown in sentences. 
2. Morphological deficits can occur in all modalities of linguistic performance. 
3. Inflectional and derivational morphology, and compounding, can be 
selectively impaired. 
4. At least some words are decomposed in comprehension and composed in 
production. 
5. In stage-by-stage models of sentence production (Garrett, 1980, 1982), on-line 
morphological breakdown is related to the positional level of sentence 
processingmthe level at which phrasal frames are specified, together with 
bound morphemes. 
6. Language-specific features contribute to the error patterns observed in aphasia. 
7. In reading, morphological impairments can mask underlying semantic or 
visual impairments since morphologically similar items are also semantically 
and visually similar. 
8. Frequency, imageability, abstractness, word class, and phonological or 
orthographic complexity influence morphological processing. 
In the pages that follow, we will present the empirical evidence and the arguments 
that underlie these assumptions and that have contributed to the advancement of our 
understanding of the breakdown of morphology in aphasia. 
14-1. MORPHOLOGICAL 
IMPAIRMENTS 
IN SENTENCE PROCESSING 
14-1.1. The Case of Agrammatism 
The most extensively investigated aphasic patients presenting with morphological dis- 
turbances are classified clinically as "agrammatic." Agrammatism is mainly defined 
as a disorder at the level of grammatical formativesmfree (auxiliaries, determiners, 
pronouns, and some prepositions) or bound (inflectional affixes); agrammatic speech 
is generally effortful and reduced, that is, sentences are short and characterized by an 
absence of embeddings. Comprehension deficits tend to parallel production deficits, 
and cross-patient as well as within-patient performances can vary significantly. Several 
diverging accounts in terms of either a representational or a processing impairment 
have been proposed in the literature (for a review and critique of the current debate, 
see Kean, 1995). 
The now widely reported behavioral variability in the performances of so-called 
agrammatic patients has led some authors (Badecker & Caramazza, 1985, 1986; Mi- 
celi, Silveri, Romani, & Caramazza, 1989) to challenge the very existence of agram- 

14 
Breakdown of Morphology in Aphasia

matism as a distinct aphasic syndrome. However, our discussion does not hinge on 
this issue because our goal is not to characterize a clinical entity or to contrast aphasic 
syndromes, but rather to specify the nature of morphological deficits in patients typ- 
ically demonstrating difficulties with bound morphology. Furthermore, agrammatism 
has been defended as a theoretically coherent aphasic category (Caplan, 1986, 1991) 
since agrammatic patients share difficulties at the level of closed-class vocabulary 
(function words and bound morphology) while performing well on open-class vocab- 
ulary (major lexical categories), irrespective of intersubject differences, and since these 
difficulties arise at a specific stage of processing, that is, the stage at which function 
words and bound morphemes are accessed in sentence production. (See Garrett, 1980, 
1982, for a model of speech production in which the generation of phrasal frames is 
closely tied to that of inflectional morphology.) 
14-1.2. Morphological Deficits in Spontaneous Speech: 
The CLAS Study 
The main feature of agrammatic speech is the omission and/or substitution of affixes. 
This feature has received increasing attention since Goodglass and Hunt (1958) first 
reported on the production of the English suffix -s in agrammatism (see Goodglass, 
1976, for a review of the early modern literature on morphological disturbances in 
aphasia), and has been studied extensively in the spontaneous speech of patients (e.g., 
Tissot, Mounin, & Lhermitte, 1973; Menn & Obler, 1990). Menn and Obler (1990) 
coordinated a large-scale crosslinguistic investigation (the Cross-Language Agram- 
matism Study, or CLAS) based on comparable corpora of conversational speech, sto- 
rytelling, and picture description in 14 languages. The study's detailed analysis of 
agrammatic speech production clearly indicates that breakdown patterns vary greatly 
across subjects and languages. For example, in Finnish (Niemi, Laine, H~inninen, & 
Koivuselk~i-Sallinen, 1990), patients appear to be syntactically rather than morpho- 
logically agrammatic. A small number of morphological errors are manifested in the 
form of substitutions of verb inflections, the only category affected. Niemi et al. argue 
that bound grammatical morphemes are not lost in a synthetic language such as Finn- 
ish, in contrast with analytic languages such as English. In a nonconcatenative lan- 
guage such as Hebrew, on the other hand, the reverse pattern is demonstrated (Ba- 
harav, 1990), with syntactic abilities being more spared than morphological ones. 
Bound morphemes give rise to substitution only, mainly in verbs. Because roots are 
consonantal in Hebrew, vocalic morphemes must be introduced for words to become 
pronounceable; thus omissions are barred from the language. Interestingly, in Japanese 
(Sasanuma, Kamio, & Kubota, 1990), where bare verb stems also cannot stand alone 
and where, therefore, only substitutions can be predicted to occur, neither omissions 
nor substitutions are reported. Sasanuma and her colleagues argue that, in Japanese, 
inflections are determined word-internally and are thus more robust, unlike in Indo- 
European languages, where agreement rules extend across words and phrases. Another 
finding relevant to the issue of cross-language variablility is that in highly inflected 

224 
Gonia Jarema 
languages such as Polish (Jarema & Kadzielawa, 1990) and Serbo-Croatian (Zei & 
Sikic, 1990) in which word order is relatively free and syntactic relations are signaled 
by case, the analysis of subjects' performances on bound morphemes clearly indicates 
that case-marking inflectional markers are not affected. The conclusion drawn from 
the variable patterns of morphological breakdown observed in Menn and Obler (1990) 
is that disturbances are determined by language-specific features and that our under- 
standing of aphasic speech benefits greatly from investigations that take into account 
theoretically motivated descriptions of the language(s) under study. 
Menn and Obler's (1990) corpora also include samples of narrative production in 
the written modality. Overall, the results obtained for the languages studied confirm 
the clinical observation that the breakdown patterns observed in the writing of agram- 
matic aphasic patients generally parallel those found in their oral productions. 
However, performance on the written narrative was strikingly spared in one of the 
Japanese-speaking agrammatic patients described in the study (Sasanuma et al., 1990). 
By contrast, a dissociation between impaired writing and spared oral reading, which 
were tested on the same narrative, was reported for several languages, for example, 
for both Japanese-speaking patients and for one of the two Finnish-speaking patients 
(Niemi et al., 1990). Although the supplementary data on writing and reading dis- 
cussed in Menn and Obler (1990) represent only small samples, they nevertheless 
indicate that oral and written impairments tend to cluster in agrammatic patients, 
whereas reading aloud is generally more resilient. 
14-1.3. The Role of Parametric Variation 
The problem of variability in aphasia has been linked to the role of language-specific 
features in language processing, among other factors. In the domain of morphology, 
Miceli, Mazzucchi, Menn, and Goodglass (1983) demonstrate the importance of par- 
ametric variation. In this study, agrammatic subjects systematically substituted rather 
than omitted inflections in Italian, a language in which O-inflected stems generally 
result in nonwords. Similar results are reported by Kehayia (1990) and Kehayia, Jar- 
ema, and Kadzielawa (1990) for Greek, a language in which bare stems are never 
legal. This pattern contrasts sharply with the one reported for the more typically 
studied English-speaking agrammatic aphasics, whose frequent omission of inflections 
results in the production of lexically well-formed bare stems (e.g., flower instead of 
flowers, or walk instead of walked). Grodzinsky (1984) cites Miceli et al. (1983) and 
discusses Russian data from Tsvjetkova and Glozman (1978) to support the view that 
patients revert to O-forms only when the stem is a word in the language, otherwise 
misselecting the required inflection. However, it has been shown that in Icelandic 
(Magn6sd6ttir & Thr~insson, 1990), bare stems are almost never produced, even when 
a O-affixed form exists in the language, as is the case with the imperative and the 
typical first person singular present form of verbs. This observation speaks against 
the thesis that agrammatic aphasics' omissions of bound affixes reflect a default mech- 
anism, that is, that in reality they represent substitutions of inflected forms by a O- 
affixed form (Grodzinsky, 1984). The cross-linguistically robust finding, reported in 

Breakdown of Morphology in Aphasia 
225 
14 
Menn and Obler (1990), that morphological substitutions are generally off-target by 
only one feature further indicates that the systematic selection of O-forms is an un- 
likely procedure since it would wrongly predict that in some instances a very distant 
form would be selected. For example, in the Polish data (Jarema & Kadzielawa, 1990), 
we do not see any cases where the O-inflected singular imperative form replaces a 
tensed form, e.g., the past tense, which is inflected for mood, aspect, tense, person, 
number, and gender (six features). 
Grodzinsky (1984) further proposes that, in contrast with many Indo-European 
languages, only inflectional substitution can be resorted to in Semitic languages, in 
which words are formed by inserting discontinuous vocalic morphemes into discon- 
tinuous consonantal roots. 1 To illustrate this structural property, the author discusses 
an example from Hebrew in which the three consonants s, m, and 1 are shared by the 
related words simla (a dress) and smalot (dresses). Omitting the vocalic base would 
result in unpronounceable nonwords, that is, forms that are both phonologically and 
morphologically illegal. 
Investigating another Semitic language, Algerian Arabic, Mimouni and Jarema 
(1995) obtained results similar to those put forth in Grodzinsky (1984) in the per- 
formance of three agrammatic subjects. In their spontaneous speech, as well as in 
sentence repetition and reading aloud, subjects resorted to substitutions and never 
produced nonwords. However, in this study, it was observed that omissions of affixes 
can and do occur in Semitic languages and that in cases where omitting the affix 
would result in a morphologically ill-formed bare stem, subjects substituted the non- 
word stem with a real-word stem. Consider examples l a and l b below. 
TARGET 
APHASIC PRODUCTION 
1 a yo-drab --> 
drab 
(He hits) ---> 
(He hit) 
lb xodm-ot ---> 
xdam 
(She worked) 
(He worked) 
In l a, drab is a word, and the omission of the prefix yo results in a substitution 
of tense. In l b, however, *xodm is a nonword and, as a result, is not produced in 
isolation. Instead, subjects who have difficulties with the prefix revert to xdam, a 
related, and legal, unaffixed form yielding a gender substitution. 
By contrast, in French, uninflected verbs surface to the level of the word, as is the 
case in English. Jarema and Kehayia (1992) show that, in a constrained sentence 
production task, French-speaking agrammatic aphasics do omit verb inflections re- 
sulting in O-inflected, but grammatical, tensed forms. However, when the omission of 
inflections would result in a different root, 2 subjects revert to substitution of the affix, 
while retaining the target root (cf. 2a and 2b below). 
lInflectional morphology in Semitic languages also includes prefixation and suffixation (see 
McCarthy, 1981). 
ZIn French, verbs from the first conjugation have a single root and are fully transparent through- 
out the verbal paradigm, while verbs from the second or third conjugations are characterized by the 
presence of two or more roots in the verbal paradigm.

In 2b, subjects did not substitute the future form of the verb with the present form 
(/vE, a O-inflected form) as in 2a. This would have required access to a different root, 
that is, the root /v~, which is used in the formation of the singular forms of the 
present tense of the verb. In line with a strong lexicalist approach to morphological 
representation, 3 this observation has implications for the internal organization of the 
mental lexicon in terms of morphological "families." More specifically, it implies the 
listing of morphologically related lexical items around a "nucleus" ("Satellite Hy- 
pothesis," Lukatela, Gligorijevic, Kostic, & Turvey, 1980) or under a "head," pos- 
sibly the root, as proposed by Jarema and Kehayia (1992). In the case of the French 
verb system, verbs featuring a single root are listed under this common root, while 
verbs featuring more than one root have separate, but linked, listings under each root. 
These separate roots act as the head of a morphological subfamily (Figure 1). 
To summarize, patients never produce items that would result in nonwords in their 
language, that is, they omit inflections only if the language permits. In cases where 
stripping a stem does not yield a real word, they resort to substitution when unable 
to access the correct form. Furthermore, the substituting inflection generally is selected 
within the target's paradigm; for example, a verb inflection is substituted by another

3The Strong Lexical Hypothesis (Jackendoff, 1975' Lieber, 1980; Scalise, 1984, Lapointe, 1985" 
Di Sciullio & Williams, 1987) posits the existence of an autonomous morphological component 
consisting of a set of listed items and a set of word-formation rules and principles; both derivational 
and inflectional operations take place in this component.

verb inflection, indicating that subcategorization features of lexical items are not vi- 
olated. Thus, importantly, not only phonotactic and phonological well-formedness cri- 
teria, but also constraints on word-formation processes, appear to be respected in the 
erroneous productions of agrammatic subjects. 
14-1.4. Predictions 
Overall, the crosslinguistic data discussed above indicate that aphasic subjects with 
morphological disorders do not produce nonwords. As a consequence, one can propose 
the following generalization, in accordance with, and expanding on, Grodzinsky's 
(1984) proposal. In languages that feature roots that surface to the level of the word 
(e.g., English), subjects resort to either omission or substitution of inflections, but 
omission tends to predominate. In languages in which roots are generally nonwords 
(e.g., Icelandic), subjects exceptionally choose an existing O-inflected form if and 
only if that form is a paradigm-internal form; otherwise, they substitute inflections. 
In languages in which the distributions of O-inflected word and nonword stems are 
relatively balanced (e.g., Polish), both omissions and substitutions occur with a high 
degree of variability in individual trends. In languages in which roots are never words 
(e.g., Greek), only substitutions are observed. These predictions were borne out in a 
crosslinguistic study (Kehayia et al., 1990) that investigated morphological errors in 
the repetition, comprehension, and production of sentences in English-, Greek-, and 
Polish-speaking agrammatic aphasics. Morphological markers were omitted in English, 
substituted in Greek, and either omitted or substituted in Polish. More specifically, in 
Polish, omissions and substitutions were found in words that allow roots to surface 
to the level of the word. However, only substitutions were found in words derived 
from O-affixed roots that are illegal. Note that when the O-affixed form features 
phonological complexity (e.g., vowel epenthesis), it was not produced. This points to 
the interaction between morphology and phonology in morphological disturbances. 
The claim, then, is that morphological omissions are variably present only when 
the inflection can be stripped, that is, when the stem produced is phonologically and 
morphologically well formed. Crucially, this claim extends to cases such as that de- 
scribed in l b, where a legal bare stem replaces the illegal stem of the stripped target 
item. Thus, the omission of bound morphemes attaching to nonword stems is possible 
at some early stage of processing difficulty; however, it is masked by the substitution 
of the stem. This observation further confirms the resilience of morphological well- 
formedness criteria observed in language pathology. 
The data reported here thus support the view that parametric variation plays a role 
in the error patterns observed in aphasia and provides evidence against Grodzinsky's 
(1990) claim that patterns of omission and substitution are likely to be item-bound 
rather than language-bound. In his revised account of inflectional deficits in agram- 
matic speech, the author does away with the "default mechanism" he had proposed 
earlier (Grodzinsky, 1984). Instead, he stipulates the existence of an "agrammatic 
grammar"--a grammar restricted by the underspecification of syntax-level values of 
inflectional features (e.g., agreement). In combination with intact word-formation 

228 
Gonia Jarema 
rules, this reduced grammar automatically yields omissions when O-inflected items 
are well formed (i.e., there is no need to generate an inflection for a feature that is 
underspecified if the uninflected word is well formed), and in all other cases it yields 
substitutions compatible with the items' representation. However, the data presented 
above clearly demonstrate that in some languages substitutions occur in spite of a 
O-inflection option; thus the language rather than the item appears to be relevant to 
the behavioral patterns manifested in aphasia. 
14-1.5. Implications for Theories of Lexical Representation 
and Access 
Importantly, all of the studies reviewed above not only underscore the role of 
language-specific lexical features in the patterns of morphological breakdown, but also 
bear upon theories of lexical representation and access. If one were to adopt a full- 
listing model of lexical representation (Butterworth, 1983) according to which all 
lexical items, simple and complex, are listed in the mental lexicon, several claims 
could be made. 4 When some lexical families exhibit several roots, as is the case in 
French, links between members of the family will not be equal and substitutions will 
reflect this inequality. Furthermore, the status of the "basic" lexical element of a 
family, if its role is validated, may vary from language to language. Lukatela et al. 
(1980) have, for example, proposed the nominative singular O-inflected form for 
Serbo-Croatian masculine nouns. This form is the nucleus around which all related 
forms are organized in a satellite-like structure. As shown above, Jarema and Kehayia 
(1992) suggest that, in French, verb forms may be headed by their root(s). For Semitic 
languages, the positionally loose consonantal root, the only link between cross- 
categorial members of a lexical family, has been proposed as the mother node of all 
the nodes it heads; each daughter node in turn heads a morphological paradigm in a 
treelike structure. (See McCarthy, 1981, for a theoretical discussion of Semitic mor- 
phology.) For Algerian Arabic, Mimouni and Jarema (1995) further propose that for 
verbs, the O-affixed perfective third person singular form, the citation form and the 
form patients produce most frequently when making errors (e.g., drab or xdam in the 
first example above), is the head of a verb paradigm in the language. Thus, the or- 
ganization of morphologically related lexical items in the mental lexicon and the 
nature of a putative base form may vary crosslinguistically and, consequently, may 
influence access patterns in normal and pathological performance. The relationship 
between morphological disturbances in aphasia and issues of lexical representation 
and access has received much attention in the study of single-word processing, which 
we will address in the following section of this chapter. 
4Dual route models such as the Augmented Addresses Morphology (AAM) model of Caramazza, 
Laudanna, and Romani (1988) or the Morphological Race (MR) model of Frauenfelder and Schreu- 
der (1992), which assume the existence of a direct access (whole-word) route and of a morphological 
decomposition route (to deal with the problem of novel words and nonwords for which there are 
no lexical entries), are also compatible with our view of the psycholinguistic implications of cross- 
linguistic evidence, since lexical items are fully listed in these models.

229 
14-2. MORPHOLOGICAL 
IMPAIRMENTS 
IN SINGLE-WORD 
PROCESSING 
An important observation with respect to morphological impairments in aphasia is 
that some patients appear to have difficulties with bound morphemes only when pro- 
cessing sentences, but not when processing words in isolation. 
14-2.1. The Dissociation between Single-Word 
and Sentence Production 
A dissociation between impaired sentence and intact single-word production in French 
is described dramatically in Nespoulous et al. (1988). However, the subject's sentence 
production difficulties at the lexical level were shown to be mild and restricted to the 
class of freestanding grammatical morphemes (mainly pronouns), and bound mor- 
phemes were not explicitly tested in the single-word production tasks used. 
A prototypical asymmetry along a strictly morphological dimension is reported by 
Caramazza and Hillis (1989a). The authors describe a patient who, in her oral and 
written narratives, as well as in three constrained sentence production tasks (oral read- 
ing, repetition, and writing to dictation), presented with inflectional errors, in contrast 
with her performance on single-word production tasks (reading, repetition, and spell- 
ing to dictation). The authors interpret this observation, together with evidence from 
a number of other tasks, to reflect a disorder at the level of representation where 
grammatical morphemes are specified in sentence constructing, that is, the "positional 
level" in Garrett's (1980, 1982) sentence production model. 
The role of syntactic structuring in morphological disturbances is further investi- 
gated by De Bleser, Bayer, and Luzzatti (1996), who report on the performance of 
two German- and two Italian-speaking agrammatic aphasics in single-word and sen- 
tence production. In both languages, subjects showed relatively well-preserved lexical 
morphology, but impaired inflectional morphology in phrasal structures when nonlocal 
operations were involved. De Bleser et al. (1996) suggest that even in severely im- 
paired patients the lexicon can be intact and that regular inflectional forms are avail- 
able in local domains. Furthermore, the presence of overt cues, such as verbal number 
cues, can "extend the threshold of structural analysis" in agrammatic performances. 
They thus propose that lexical information is available and that bound morphology 
becomes vulnerable only when patients fail in constructing phrasal structures. 
14-2.2. The Dissociation between Single-Word Recognition 
and Sentence Comprehension 
The coexistence of intact processing of morphologically complex words when tested 
in isolation and of impaired sensitivity to inflectional affixes when tested in sentences 
has also been shown to exist in the auditory modality. Tyler and Cobb (1987) and 
Tyler, Behrens, Cobb, and Marslen-Wilson (1990) present agrammatic patients with 

230 
Gonia Jarema 
normal recognition of polymorphemic words who were unable to detect morphological 
errors in context in a word-monitoring task. Unlike the group of control subjects, the 
patients were not faster in monitoring for words immediately preceded by a correctly 
inflected test item rather than by an incorrectly inflected one. The authors concluded 
that the patients were not impaired in their ability to recognize complex words. Rather, 
they were unable to process inflectional morphology on-line; that is, they could not 
use syntactic and semantic information encoded in the affixes in sentence computing. 
Friederici, Wessels, Emmorey, and Bellugi (1992) report on the ability of four 
German-speaking agrammatic aphasics to process inflectional morphology. They pres- 
ent two experiments also using the word-monitoring paradigm and claim, in line with 
Tyler and her colleagues, that agrammatic patients are unable to retrieve the full syn- 
tactic information encoded in inflectional affixes on-line. Friederici et al. (1992) further 
argue that this does not imply that syntactic knowledge cannot be derived at all. 
Indeed, their first experiment crisply demonstrates that patients are sensitive to inflec- 
tional morphemes as markers of grammatical category. In the experiment, violations 
of grammatical category were introduced by using tensed verbs derived from stems 
that are homophonous with simple nouns (e.g., tanz-, dance) in a context requiring a 
verbal form (e.g., *ER TANZ "he dance"; control: ER TANZTE "he danced") or 
by attaching an illegal verbal affix to a noun in a position where the presence of a 
verbal form yields an ungrammatical sentence (e.g., *EIN TANZTE "a danced"; 
control: EIN TANZ "a dance"). 5 However, the study's second experiment in which 
within-category inflectional violations (*ER TANZTEST "he danced": 2nd pers. 
sing.) were presented did not yield a grammaticality effect. Friederici et al. (1992) 
contend that agrammatic aphasics suffer from a "selective disruption of the temporal 
organization of language processing." The authors' thesis is that there is a dissociation 
between structural knowledge, which is preserved as evidenced by off-line tasks 
(Shankweiler, Crain, Correl, & Tuller, 1989; Lukatela, Crain, & Shankweiler, 1988; 
Wulfeck, 1987), and time-dependent computational knowledge in these patients. 
14-2.3. Parallelism between Single-Word and Sentence Production 
Alongside cases of asymmetrical performances, patients presenting with morpholog- 
ical disturbances in the production of both sentences and single words are reported in 
the literature. This symmetry points toward a breakdown in lexical processes rather 
than in accessing bound morphemes during sentence planning. Miceli and Caramazza 
(1988), for instance, describe a patient who could be classified clinically as "agram- 
matic" and who showed a 50% error rate in repeating affixed words presented in 
isolation. Stems, prefixes, and derivational suffixes were intact, while inflectional suf- 
fixes were severely affected. The authors claim that these findings support the view 
that lexical items are decomposed (Taft & Forster, 1975; Taft, 1979), 6 that morpho- 
5Upper-case fonts were used in the study since in German all common nouns are capitalized. 
6In sharp contrast with the Full Listing Hypothesis (Butterworth, 1983), this theory postulates 
that multimorphemic words are recognized through an affix-stripping decomposition process that 
isolates the root (e.g., un-think-able) and initiates its lookup in a lexicon of roots. 

14 
Breakdown of Morphology in Aphasia 
231 
logical operations are located in the lexicon, and that inflectional and derivational 
processes are functionally distinct, that is, that morphological subcomponents can be 
selectively impaired in aphasia. 
14-2.4. The Asymmetry between Derivational/Inflectional Affixation 
and Compounding 
Luzzatti and De Bleser (1996) used a set of carefully constructed off-line experiments 
aimed at further probing the issue of morphological dissociations in two previously 
studied Italian-speaking agrammatic aphasics (see discussion of De Bleser et al., 1996, 
above). The subjects were asked to provide the inflectional markers of gender and 
number for simple, derived, and compound nouns, as well as to produce prepositions 
in prepositional compounds (pasta [al] forno) and to supply adjectival derivational 
suffixes (una eruzione vulcan[ica]). Results revealed a number of theoretically rele- 
vant dissociations. The first patient, MG, was unimpaired at the inflectional and der- 
ivational levels, while his performance on compounds was very poor. The second 
patient, DR, also showed problems with compounds and, like MG, performed flaw- 
lessly on derivation. However, although DR's regular inflections seemed to be spared, 
his capacity to produce irregular affixes was highly affected and manifested itself in 
the form of overgeneralizations of regular affixational rules. Both patients could thus 
construct derived words but not compounds, and both could make use of lexical rules 
for inflecting and deriving words, but again not for compounds. In view of these 
asymmetries, and in view of the fact that the only impaired morphological subcom- 
ponent is the one where syntactic principles are involved at the word level, Luzzatti 
and De Bleser interpret their findings as evidence against a strictly morphological 
account of agrammatism and as support for the thesis that the underlying deficit is 
syntactic in nature. This assumption is further supported by De Bleser et al.'s (1996) 
study reviewed earlier in which morphological breakdown is syntactically determined. 
14-2.5. Single-Word Disturbances in Dyslexia: The Issue 
of Confounding Factors 
A further observation is that aphasic patients who present with morphological deficits 
in oral production sometimes also cannot read bound morphemes correctly. Badecker 
and Caramazza (1987) report on a dyslexic patient whose speech was nonfluent and 
reduced and who produced morphological errors in the form of affix deletions and sub- 
stitutions. In reading, his performance included visual, semantic, inflectional, and 
derivational errors. Given that morphologically related words are often visually similar, 
and because they are also semantically related, the authors were concerned that reading 
errors that are identified as morphological errors may in fact be visual or semantic 
errors. They constructed a number of highly controlled reading tasks that included 
lists of morphologically simple and complex (affixed) words, monomorphemic pseu- 
dosuffixed words (wicked), and words containing pseudostems, that is, words embed- 
ded in words (pierce). Stimuli were matched in frequency and letter length. The 

232 
Gonia Jarema 
subject made more errors reading polymorphemic affixed stimuli than monomor- 
phemic pseudoaffixed or pseudostem stimuli. Badecker and Caramazza (1987) inter- 
pret these results as evidence in favor of a morphological rather than a visual account 
of the subject's errors. The authors caution readers, however, that high-stem or pseu- 
dostem frequencies, as opposed to whole-word frequencies, may have influenced the 
differences obtained. Further testing with other stimuli yielding a significant dissoci- 
ation along a purely linguistic dimension led Badecker and Caramazza (1987) to sug- 
gest that at least some of the reading errors in acquired dyslexia are morphological 
in nature. The importance of this study lies in underscoring that an array of factors, 
such as visual similarity, semantic relatedness, frequency, concreteness, phonological 
complexity, or grammatical category, can contribute to reading words erroneously. 
Each of these factors must be considered in the light of linguistic and psycholinguistic 
theories of the lexicon before the claim that reading errors reflect a disturbance of 
morphological processing can be made. Badecker and Caramazza reinforce their cau- 
tionary stand by surveying two early studies that reported on a morphological pro- 
cessing deficit in the oral reading of dyslexic patients (Patterson, 1982; Job & Sartori, 
1984) and by arguing that the authors fail to provide valid support for their claim that 
their subject's errors can be attributed to a breakdown at the level of morphology. 
14-2.6. Single-Word Disturbances in the Written Modality 
Cases of patients producing morphological errors in single-word tasks in the written 
modality have also been observed. Badecker, Hillis, and Caramazza (1990) describe 
a patient with acquired agraphia who deleted, substituted, transposed, and inserted 
letters asymmetrically toward the end of monomorphemic words, but whose error rate 
declined in the region of the suffix in multimorphemic words. Similarly, his error rate 
was low in the initial portion of prefixed words and only started rising at the beginning 
of the stem. In compounds, his errors were equally distributed; that is, error rates were 
higher at the end of both conjuncts. This compositionality effect was not observed in 
length-matched monomorphemic words containing pseudostems (e.g., yearn, dogma). 
Badecker et al.'s (1990) findings thus provide strong evidence for morpheme-sized 
rather than whole-word processing units in writing. 
14-2.7. Limited Processing Resources: Evidence from On-Line Tasks 
The patterns of performance reported in the literature seem to be consistent with the 
view that, at least in some aphasic patients, knowledge of the structure of multimor- 
phemic words, that is, knowledge at the level of lexical representation, is not entirely 
"lost." Rather, limited processing resources appear to be responsible for the deficits 
observed. This is not only revealed by within-patient variation and by modality- 
specific disturbances, but also by the error patterns observed in the processing of 
multimorphemic words. For example, Libben (1990) describes an agrammatic Broca's 
aphasic who produced repetition errors only in nontransparent multimorphemic words, 
such as illegible and regularity, as opposed to transparent forms such as unhappiness 

14 
Breakdown of Morphology in Aphasia 
233 
and materialism. His erroneous productions--for example, inlegible (failure to assim- 
ilate segments) and r~_gularity (failure to shift stress)mare most revealing. In these 
cases, the patient decomposed the word and produced the form of the underlying 
stemmwhich must thus be representedmwithout making the required phonological 
adjustments in the affix or in the stem. Libben interprets these findings as evidence 
for a decrease in processing resources resulting from the formal complexity of mul- 
timorphemic words, and for "doing morphology" on-line. Reporting on the same 
patient, Libben (1994) shows that when tested in a naming latency experiment using 
legally (e.g., birmity) and illegally affixed nonsense stems (rebirmity, where the suffix 
-ity attaches to the root birm forming the noun stem birmity, and where morphological 
well-formedness is violated since the prefix re- can only attach to verbs), the patient 
performs more slowly and produces more errors in naming the illegally affixed items 
than the legally affixed ones. Libben argues that this behavioral pattern is an indication 
that selectional restrictions of affixes are available during word production. 
Further evidence for the availability of lexical information is found in the parallel 
results obtained for normal and aphasic subjects in lexical decision tasks (Kehayia & 
Jarema, 1994; Mimouni, Kehayia, & Jarema, 1992). In both studies, although patients 
showed considerably slower reaction times, response patterns were very similar to 
those obtained from normal subjects; that is, patients were remarkably sensitive to the 
language-specific features of Greek and Polish, and of Arabic, respectively. 
14-2.8. Summary 
Overall, patients seem to be sensitive to word-internal structure, as evidenced through 
their performance on off- and on-line tasks conducted in a variety of languages. Fur- 
thermore, the observation that morphemes tend to be recognized or retrieved together 
with their accompanying features and that morphological breakdown generally does 
not lead to word-formation violations 7 points toward the availability of linguistic rule 
knowledge. Finally, although multimorphemic words can be impaired in isolation, they 
seem to be particularly vulnerable when brought to interact with the domain of syn- 
tactic processing. 
14-3. CONCLUDING 
REMARKS 
In this chapter, we have demonstrated that descriptions of morphological disturbances 
in aphasia are increasingly enhanced by linguistic and psycholinguistic theory. We 
have cited studies of impaired morphological processing that incorporate theoretically 
motivated linguistic distinctions and that reveal properties of the mental representation 
and organization of multimorphemic items and specify the cognitive processes in- 
volved in word recognition and production. With respect to the structural aspects of 
the mental lexicon, one is led to infer a representational system not only from the 
7See Laine, et al. for a counterexample.

patterns of errors found in language pathology, but also from the lexical access or 
retrieval procedures that these patterns suggest. Thus, a whole-word mechanism im- 
plies the listing of all lexical items, whereas a decomposition-composition mechanism 
compels one to assume a listing of either (a) all atomic forms, roots and affixes alike, 
(b) all lexical simple and complex forms, with some form of representation of 
word-internal structure for multimorphemic entries, or (c) a listing of roots, each 
specified for all the possible affixes that can attach to it. Furthermore, the full-listing 
assumption, whether entries are morphologically opaque or transparent, has been fur- 
ther refined to include evidence of modes of lexical storage of morphologically related 
items. Formal aspects of lexical organization, such as the construct of "morphological 
family," together with the concepts of "link" and of "nucleus" (or "basic unit of 
representation"), have been developed. Finally, hybrid systems, such as the dual-route 
models in which both whole-word and morpheme-sized units are represented, feature 
full listing of chunk-type multimorphemic words with pointers toward listed compo- 
nent morphemes, however, without representation of morphological relatedness. 8 
In conclusion, it is heartening to witness a convergence of efforts to capture the 
nature of morphological disturbances in aphasia across languages, tasks, and theoret- 
ical frameworks, particularly in view of the considerable challenge researchers are 
faced with in designing highly controlled experiments that will shed light on the 
interaction between morphological errors and various processing factors and that will 
also reliably dissociate morphological deficits from other word-level deficits. Un- 
doubtedly, the growing body of experimental work on word recognition and produc- 
tion will further the emergence of increasingly satisfactory proposals on the organi- 
zation of the mental lexicon and on the computational mechanisms involved in normal 
and impaired morphological processing. This in turn will ensure a more informed 
description of morphological breakdown in aphasia. 
8In this chapter, we have not discussed network models (e.g., Fowler, Napps, & Feldman, 1985; 
Dell, 1986), which are representational systems that do not rely on parsing. In such models, all 
morphologically related lexical items are represented as interconnected nodes, with connections 
between nodes varying in weight and governing the patterns of activation across nodes. 

CHAPTER 15 
The Shadows of Lexical Meaning in 
Patients with Semantic Impairments 
Peter Hagoort

Central in the processing of words is the retrieval of their meaning. Neurological 
diseases can affect the processing of lexical meaning in a number of ways. First, 
various examples of semantic impairments are discussed, including semantic par- 
aphasias, deep dyslexic reading errors, and category-general and category- 
specific impairments in the semantics of concrete nouns. Next a number of 
theoretically relevant issues in studies on semantic impairments are discussed: 
(a) the concreteness effect, (b) impairments of perceptual versus functional in- 
formation, (c) amodal versus multiple semantic systems, and (d) access impair- 
ments versus storage deficits. On the basis of a review of the neuropsychological 
evidence, it is proposed that the representation of lexical meaning consists of 
conceptual structures tied to models that are tailored to the requirements of the 
different sensory systems and the motor system. 
A central notion in all models of language production and language comprehension 
is the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon refers to the knowledge of the language 
user about the words of his/her language(s). This knowledge specifies not only the

sound pattern and the orthography of words, but also their grammatical properties 
(e.g., word class, gender), their morphological structure, and their meaning. Both neu- 
ropsychological evidence and recent brain-imaging studies have shown that these dif- 
ferent types of word knowledge are represented in widely distributed areas of the brain. 
The role of the mental lexicon in language processing is to mediate between dif- 
ferent representational domains, including form (sound, orthography) and meaning. 
To do this effectively, the mental lexicon has to contain information about a large 
number of words. For instance, an adult speaker of English has an estimated passive 
vocabulary of at least 40,000 words (Nagy & Herman, 1987). On the basis of the 
spoken or written input, the best matching word form in the mental lexicon is selected. 
As a result, the adult speaker of English gains access to all the information associated 
with this particular word form. For instance, he or she knows that it is a noun or a 
verb, that it refers to an animal that flies, or to the act of flying, and so forth. 
This chapter focuses on the processing of a central aspect of words, namely, lexical 
meaning. Although there is some disagreement about whether the meaning of words 
should be treated as lexical knowledge per se, there is no disagreement about the 
centrality of meaning in word processing. The centrality of meaning is further sup- 
ported by the neurolinguistic literature, which provides ample evidence that brain 
damage can affect the ability to select (in speaking and writing) and recognize (in 
listening and reading) the appropriate lexical-semantic representations. 
15-1. SEMANTIC 
IMPAIRMENTS 
Ideally, a neurolinguistic theory of semantic impairments is based on an explicit ac- 
count of how lexical meaning is represented in the unaffected language system. How- 
ever, surprisingly enough, the nature of meaning representations has not played a 
major role in studies of semantic impairments. In these studies, the two central themes 
of the last decade are (a) category and modality specificity of semantic impairments 
and semantic representations, and (b) degraded representations versus access impair- 
ments. Often these issues are addressed without clear statements about the notion of 
meaning representation that underlies the interpretation of the results. However, it is 
not at all clear that satisfying answers to the questions involved can be given in the 
absence of an explicit account of meaning representations. 
To set the stage for discussing a number of theoretically relevant issues in the 
semantic impairment literature, I will first describe a few symptoms and syndromes 
associated with impairments at the level of lexical-semantic processing. 
15-1.1. Semantic Paraphasias 
A common symptom in patients with a Wernicke-type aphasia are so-called semantic 
paraphasias. In this type of paraphasia, a word is produced that deviates in meaning 
from the intended word (Poeck, 1982). The actually produced word very often has 
some semantic similarity to the intended word. For instance, an aphasic patient whom 

15 
Lexical-Semantic Processing 
237 
I asked to describe a picture of a man reading a newspaper replied, "The man reads 
the radio." Another aphasic patient said in an interview about his disease that he 
"became deaf in his eye." When tested in a word-picture-matching task, such patients 
regularly correctly match words like newspaper and radio to the relevant picture, 
indicating that the semantic specifications of the intended words are still largely intact. 
The observation that semantic paraphasias are often in the same semantic field as 
the intended word (e.g., radio-newspaper, deaf-blind) suggest that they are not unlike 
a particular type of speech error in normal speech, namely, word substitutions (cf. 
Levelt, 1989). 
15-1.2. Deep Dyslexia 
Word substitutions on the basis of sensory instead of conceptual input are found in 
patients with deep dyslexia. Deep dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder with se- 
mantic errors as its most striking symptom. A patient with deep dyslexia might, for 
instance, read the orthographic string RIVER as "ocean." However, the actual error 
pattern is complicated by the presence of a number of co-occurring symptoms. These 
include visual errors (SCANDAL read as "sandals"), morphological errors (SELL 
read as "sold"), and a better performance for concrete than for abstract words. Dif- 
ferent explanations have been given for this clustering of symptoms. One possibility 
is that in fact we are faced with a number of independent deficits that co-occur for 
anatomical reasons. The brain damage happened to affect anatomically proximal areas 
subserving independent language functions. However, no evidence has been obtained 
in direct support of this hypothesis. 
An interesting attempt to explain the co-occurrence of semantic and visual errors 
as well as the concreteness effect is found in a connectionist model of acquired dys- 
lexia (Hinton & Shallice, 1991; see Plaut & Shallice, 1993a, for a detailed account 
of the model). In this model, patterns of activation in the layer of orthographic units 
are converted into associated patterns of activity in the layers representing the semantic 
space. If the initial pattern of activation within the semantic space falls within the 
region of a particular meaning, the pattern of activation converges on the pattern of 
activation representing that meaning (see Figure 1). These regions of convergence are 
called the basins of attraction. 
In the model, the basins of attraction for words with similar meanings tend to be 
in close proximity. In addition, the attractor basins for similarly spelled words tend 
to be close to each other. Similarly spelled words are thus mapped onto nearby points 
in semantic space (see Figure 1). Damage to this network (e.g., removal of subsets of 
the nodes or connections, or addition of noise to the weights on the connections) can 
change the boundaries of the basins of attraction. As a result, the initial pattern of 
activation in semantic space might fall into an incorrect basin of attraction. Because 
both semantically and orthographically related words are likely to have nearby basins 
of attraction, when the initial pattern of semantic activation falls into the incorrect 
basin, either a semantic (CAT read as "dog"), a visual (CAT read as "can") or a 
mixed error (CAT read as "rat") might result.

FIGURE 1 
A representation of the basins of attraction at the semantic level of the attractor network 
for reading (after Plaut& Shallice, 1993). The solid ovals depict the basins of attraction. Information is 
converted from the orthographic layer (CAT) to a position somewhere in semantic space. As a result of 
activity in an additional layer of the network (i.e., the cleanup layer), this position is drawn to the point 
corresponding to the closest meaning ("cat"). Whenever the network's initial semantic output appears 
within a basin of attraction, the network's state will inexorably be drawn to one position within the region. 
This position is the point in semantic space that represents the meaning (e.g., "cat") that is associated with 
the orthographic input (e.g., CAT). However, a lesion in the network can change the boundaries of the 
basins of attraction. As a result, CAT might fall into the basin of attraction of "cot." 
Although this connectionist model nicely accounts for the clustering of errors in 
deep dyslexia, there is very little independent evidence to date for a nonarbitrary 
mapping between orthographic and semantic representations (Rueckl & Dror, 1994). 
15-1.3. Semantic Dementia 
In recent years, an increasing number of patients have been reported with a progres- 
sive, degenerative brain disease that initially shows up as a selective semantic im- 
pairment. This disorder is known as semantic dementia (Hodges, Graham, & Patterson, 
1995; Hodges, Patterson, Oxbury, & Funnell, 1992; Snowden, Goulding, & Neary, 
1989). Brain-imaging data indicate that temporal lobe damage, predominantly in the 
left hemisphere, is crucially involved in the disease process. Semantic dementia should 
be distinguished from a syndrome called primary progressive aphasia (PPA; Mesulam, 
1982). PPA is also a progressive, degenerative brain disease. However, in this case 
the impairment of the phonological and syntactic aspects of language is most prom- 
inent, whereas comprehension is relatively preserved. 

15 
Lexical-Semantic Processing 
239 
Patients with semantic dementia can often only produce the category name when 
confronted with a picture or a name (e.g., geese--"an animal, but I've forgotten 
precisely"). On the whole, these patients show a fairly consistent pattern of break- 
down, with loss of knowledge about semantic attributes, but relatively long-term pres- 
ervation of superordinate category information. Hodges et al. (1995) tested patients 
with semantic dementia longitudinally during their progressive disease on a series of 
semantic tests, including naming of the Snodgrass pictures. A characteristic longitu- 
dinal performance pattern is illustrated by patient J.L., who responded as follows to 
the picture of an elephant in four different sessions over a 1.5-year period: (1) "ele- 
phant," (2)"horse," (3)"horse," (4)"animal." There is a clear progression from 
the specific, correct response to a prototypical instance of large animals ("horse") to 
the generic "animal" response. Semantic dementia patients usually show a parallel 
decline in tests of comprehension and production. This parallel decline suggests that 
a central semantic deficit underlies the semantic impairments observed in different 
language modalities. 
I have given a few examples of neurological syndromes with semantic impairment 
as one of their most salient characteristics. In the remainder of this chapter, I will 
focus on a few theoretically interesting aspects of the reported semantic impairment 
symptomatology (for an excellent review, see Saffran & Schwartz, 1994). These are 
(a) the concreteness effect, (b) impairments of perceptual versus functional informa- 
tion, (c) amodal versus multiple semantic systems, and (d) access impairments versus 
degraded representations. 
15-2. THE 
CONCRETENESS 
EFFECT 
Brain-damaged subjects often show a better performance in the production and com- 
prehension of concrete words than abstract words. Normal subjects also show a pro- 
cessing advantage for concrete words, but this effect is strongly amplified in patients. 
It has been known for a long time that, in general, aphasic patients are more impaired 
in retrieving abstract words than concrete words. The same holds for patients with 
reading disorders such as deep dyslexia. 
One can find at least three different accounts of this concreteness effect in the 
literature (Breedin, Saffran, & Coslett, 1994). According to Paivio (1991), the advan- 
tage for concrete words is due to the existence of a dual code for this class of words, 
one verbal and the other nonverbal (imaginable). Abstract words, in contrast, only 
activate a verbal code. 
The context availability account of Schwanenflugel (1991) explains the effect by 
assuming that concrete words are embedded in a larger body of associated contextual- 
perceptual information in memory than are abstract words. 
Finally, a third possibility is that concrete words are represented by a larger set of 
semantic features than abstract words (Plaut & Shallice, 1993a). When there is an 
impairment of the mapping of orthography onto semantics in the Hinton and Shallice 
model of acquired dyslexia (Hinton & Shallice, 1991), the reading of abstract words 

240 
Peter Hagoort 
is more affected than the reading of concrete words; that is, lesioning the network has 
the strongest consequences for words with a relatively sparse semantic representation. 
All three accounts thus assume that concrete words activate a richer representational 
structure in memory than do abstract words. In general, this makes concrete words 
easier to access and remember, and less vulnerable to brain damage. However, this 
shared feature of the accounts of the concreteness effect cannot easily explain the 
cases of patients who are better at retrieving abstract than concrete word information. 
At least five such cases have been reported in the neuropsychological literature (Bree- 
din et al., 1994). This reversal of the concreteness effect has potential implications 
for our understanding of the nature of semantic or conceptual representations. 
Breedin et al. (1994) argue that a crucial difference between concrete and abstract 
words resides in the sensorimotor (including perceptual) attributes of the former. On 
this account, attributes of perception and action are part of the representations of 
concrete but not of abstract words. Selective impairment of these sensorimotor attrib- 
utes might be a core aspect of the semantic disorder of patients with a reversed 
concreteness effect. The observed double dissociation between impairments of con- 
crete and abstract words implies that there is more than just a quantitative difference 
in their representational structure. To account for the full set of patient data, it seems 
necessary to assume and specify qualitative rather than only quantitative representa- 
tional differences between concrete and abstract words. 
15-3. IMPAIRMENTS 
OF PERCEPTUAL 
VERSUS 
FUNCTIONAL 
INFORMATION 
Further evidence for the importance of sensorimotor attributes in the representation 
of concrete nouns comes from patients with category-specific deficits. Elizabeth War- 
rington and her colleagues especially (for an overview, see McKenna & Warrington, 
1993) have reported a number of single cases in which semantic knowledge of either 
objects of nature (e.g., animals, fruits, vegetables) or man-made artifacts (e.g., tools, 
furniture, kitchen utensils) was selectively impaired. So far, more cases have been 
reported with a loss of knowledge of living things than of artifacts. However, generally 
the number of cases is too limited to determine whether this distributional difference 
is meaningful. 
Patients with category-specific deficits show, among other things, striking differ- 
ences in the adequacy and specificity of their definitions for words from the two 
classes. One patient (J.B.R.), for instance, described a briefcase as a "a small case 
held by students to carry papers," but when asked to define daffodil, J.B.R. could 
only come up with "plant." Although it has been suggested that these category- 
specific deficits can be attributed to a lack of control over differences in the familiarity 
and visual aspects of the stimuli, it is unlikely that one can attribute all the reported 
cases to imperfect testing procedures (Saffran & Schwartz, 1994). 
A theoretically important issue raised by the reports of these category-specific 
deficits is to determine the precise nature of the semantic dimension that cuts the 
semantic impairment pie into living and nonliving things. The best candidate seems 

15 
Lexical-Semantic Processing 
24 1 
to be the distinction between perceptual and functional attributes. Warrington and 
Shallice (1984) suggested that sensory attributes are very salient features for the iden- 
tification of living things such as animals or fruits. In contrast, functional attributes 
are probably more important than perceptual characteristics for the identification of 
artifacts such as tools. Recent empirical evidence supports the claim that visual fea- 
tures are more salient in definitions of living things than of artifacts (Farah & Mc- 
Clelland, 1991). 
In a further refinement of this account, Warrington and McCarthy (1987; McCarthy 
& Warrington, 1990b) have proposed that the contributions of sensory (perceptual) 
and motor (functional) channels are differentially weighted not only between but also 
within categories. For instance, within the category of artifacts, small manipulable 
tools are associated with a repertoire of skilled movements, and hence rely more 
heavily on motor channels than do large man-made objects such as airplanes. Air- 
planes are probably not too different from birds in their reliance on sensory channels 
for identification and categorization. 
15-3.1. Evidence from Brain-Imaging Studies 
Supportive evidence that there is a relation between conceptual knowledge and brain 
systems for perception and action comes from a PET study by Martin, Wiggs, Un- 
gerleider, and Haxby (1996). In this study, subjects were asked to name pictures of 
animals and of tools. For pictures of both kinds, bilateral activation was obtained in 
ventral regions of the temporal lobes. The naming of animals resulted in additional 
activation in the left medial occipital lobe, an area involved in visual processing. In 
contrast, the naming of tools led to additional activation in the left premotor area and 
an area in the left middle temporal gyrus. These areas are close to cortical tissue that 
is active when using objects and perceiving motion. The authors conclude that the 
brain circuitry underlying the conceptual representation of objects includes regions 
that are particularly well suited for the processing of their most salient meaning aspects 
(perceptual, functional). 
This evidence is largely compatible with an analysis of the lesion data of patients 
with disorders in the identification of living things versus man-made artifacts. On the ba- 
sis of a review of the lesion data of the known cases, Gainotti, Silveri, Daniele, and 
Giustolisi (1995) conclude that the lesion distribution of these two patient types suggests 
a dominance of areas for visual object processing (living things) versus areas that are 
especially important for somatosensory and motor functions (man-made artifacts). 
In conclusion, the neurological evidence seems to be compatible with the distinc- 
tion between perceptual and functional attributes as an important metric for semantic 
categorization. 
15-3.2. Implications for Lexical Semantics 
Although the category-specific deficit data support the importance of a distinction 
between perceptual and functional attributes for concept retrieval, their full interpre- 
tation with respect to the processing of lexical meaning is dependent on one's theory 

242 
Peter Hagoort 
of semantics. For instance, one influential theory of semantics makes a distinction 
between the core of a concept and nondefining features that are usually used for a 
quick identification of the concept (Armstrong, Gleitman, & Gleitman, 1983; Osherson 
& Smith, 1981). Neither the patient data nor the PET results allow one to determine 
whether it is the core aspects of meaning that are represented in the area of lesion or 
activation. The alternative option is that the identification procedures are localized in 
the visual and sensorimotor areas, whereas the core meaning aspects are represented 
in other brain areas. The lack of an explicit account of meaning in many neuropsy- 
chological studies of semantic impairments certainly adds to the confusion about the 
interpretation of the results. The same holds for recent brain-imaging studies in the 
area of semantics (Caramazza, 1996; Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Da- 
masio, 1996; Martin, Haxby, Lalonde, Wiggs, & Ungerleider, 1995; Martin et al., 
1996; Ungerleider, 1995). 
Jackendoff's account of conceptual-semantic structure might be of help here. Jack- 
endoff (1987) argues that the representation of a word in long-term memory includes 
not only a description in a propositional format, but also an abstract visual-geometric 
description (a 3-D model, in Marr's terminology). This claim "reflects the intuition 
that knowing the meaning of a word that denotes a physical object involves in part 
knowing what such an object looks like" (p. 104). A similar idea is present in some 
instances of prototype theory in which word-meaning representations contain an image 
of a stereotypical instance. But the proposed 3-D model is a more abstract represen- 
tation in which objects are spatially decomposed into parts and subparts in a 
viewer-independent orientation. 
The neuropsychological data and the results from brain-imaging studies, however, 
indicate that Jackendoff's theory of lexical semantics needs further extension. Not 
only is a 3-D model part of word knowledge in semantic memory, but, for certain 
classes of words, the functionally relevant motor aspects might be represented as well. 
According to Jackendoff (1987), these functional aspects can be dealt with in the 
3-D model too. However, the empirical data indicate that functional aspects might 
actually need to be specified in a structural description of another kind, more tailored 
to the properties of the motor system. Crucially, Jackendoff's account points toward 
ways of enriching the lexical-semantic representations of concrete nouns with speci- 
fications of their perception and action attributes in terms of their respective formats. 
15-4. MULTIPLE 
SEMANTIC 
SYSTEMS? 
An issue that has led to considerable controversy in the last decade is whether there 
is one amodal semantic system, or different, independent, and modality-specific se- 
mantic representations. The empirical evidence for this latter option consists largely 
of semantic impairments that only occur in one input modality (for relevant ERP data, 
see Ganis, Kutas, & Sereno, 1996). McCarthy and Warrington (1988) reported a pa- 
tient (T.O.B.) with a selective impairment for animals. However, this impairment was 
only observed when animal names were presented verbally, but not when presented 

15 
Lexical-Semantic Processing 
243 
as pictures. For example, T.O.B. gave as definition for the spoken word rhinoceros: 
"Animal, can't give you any further function." However, when shown a picture of a 
rhinoceros, he gave a much more specific description: "Enormous, weighs over one 
ton, lives in Africa." Warrington and McCarthy (1994) have reported a patient with 
a category-specific deficit for common objects such as knives, cups, and so forth, but 
only when visually presented. On the basis of these case reports, Warrington and 
McCarthy (1994; see also Shallice, 1993) hypothesize that there are modality-specific 
meaning systems (e.g., visual semantics and verbal semantics). On the basis of the 
occurrence of similar category-specific deficits in the verbal and the visual semantic 
systems they claim that the organizational principles (e.g., sensory versus functional 
core aspects) are the same in these two modality-specific semantic systems. 
The notion of multiple modality-specific semantic systems has been strongly crit- 
icized (e.g., Caplan, 1992; Caramazza, Hillis, Rapp, & Romani, 1990; Rapp, Hillis, 
& Caramazza, 1993; Saffran & Schwartz, 1994). A major problem is that no speci- 
fication of visual semantics is given. Is it something like Marr's 3-D model? Jack- 
endoff (1987) has convincingly shown that a 3-D model alone is insufficient as a 
conceptual representation of objects. In the absence of an articulated account of visual 
semantics, it is unclear what the notion of visual semantics will do for us. In addition, 
the data clearly do not exclude the possibility that it is modality-specific access (or 
identification) procedures that are impaired rather than modality-specific conceptual 
knowledge itself. 
Since this chapter is about lexical meaning, the focus is on semantic representations 
that are tailored to the verbal system. Therefore, it is sufficient to conclude that, 
intriguing as these modality-specific semantic impairments are, the implications for 
representational and processing accounts of lexical meaning are far from clear. 
15-5. IMPAIRED ACCESS VERSUS LOSS 
OF SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE 
So far in my discussion of the different semantic impairments there has often been 
the implicit assumption that these impairments impact the lexical-semantic represen- 
tations, whatever their characterization. However, this is not the only possibility. It 
might well be that the brain damage affects the access or retrieval operations rather 
than the representational structures themselves. Therefore, it is important to deter- 
mine whether an observed semantic deficit is due to the loss or degradation of 
word-meaning representations (a storage deficit), or to a failure in the routine proce- 
dures called upon to access and exploit these representations in real time (an access 
deficit). 
It is not easy to formulate criteria that allow an unambiguous distinction between 
these two general options (for an in-depth treatment, see Shallice, 1988). One reason 
for this is that the nature of neither lexical-semantic representations nor access oper- 
ations is sufficiently specified (cf. Rapp & Caramazza, 1993). Nevertheless, a number 
of criteria have been defined to distinguish between impaired access and loss of 

244 
Peter Hagoort 
semantic knowledge (e.g., Shallice, 1988; Warrington & Shallice, 1979; for criticism 
of these criteria, see Caplan, 1992; Rapp & Caramazza, 1993). 
15-5.1. Consistency in Performance 
One important criterion for distinguishing between impaired access and loss of se- 
mantic knowledge is item consistency in performance. In the case of degraded se- 
mantic representations, it is predicted that the inability to identify or name an item 
should be consistent over time and across tests. In contrast, an access impairment is 
associated with performance variability across time and tests for the same item. For 
patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), consistency in performance has 
been reported in a number of cases. The same names they failed to produce in a 
picture-naming task were the ones they failed to recognize in a word-to-picture- 
matching test (Chertkow & Bub, 1990; Huff, Corkin, & Growdon, 1986). In addition, 
Chertkow and Bub (1990) reported that on a retest, a group of 10 DAT patients failed 
to name 92.5% of the items that they were unable to name during an earlier testing 
session. This consistency in performance across tests and over time is in marked 
contrast with the absence of consistency across a range of semantic tests in a group 
of aphasic patients with impaired language comprehension (Butterworth, Howard, & 
McLoughlin, 1984). 
Consistency measures suggest that in Alzheimer patients we see a real breakdown 
of semantic representations, whereas in aphasic patients an access impairment is more 
likely than a semantic breakdown. However, since only a limited number of studies 
have explicitly tested item consistency, these effects need replication. In addition, more 
stringent tests are required to unambiguously determine the locus of the knowledge 
degradation. For instance, the inability to name a picture might be due to a loss of 
the word concept, but it could also arise from an impairment at the level of word- 
form representations. 
15-5.2. Semantic Priming 
In the last decade or so, most studies that have addressed the issue of impaired access 
versus degraded representation have used the semantic priming technique. Since the 
early seventies (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971), it has been a well-known and robust 
phenomenon in psycholinguistics that the processing of a word benefits from the 
presence of a preceding word to which it is related in meaning. For instance, subjects 
name the word dog faster when they have just seen (or heard) the word cat than when 
they have seen (or heard) the word bar. This processing advantage of the primed word 
(dog) is often attributed to the increase in activation that its concept node inherits 
from the related prime (cat). 
In the influential model of Collins and Loftus (1975; see Figure 2), lexical meanings 
are thought to be organized as a network of concept nodes, with the network's wiring 
diagram determined by semantic similarity: there are stronger and more direct con- 
nections for semantically related nodes than for unrelated nodes. Upon reading or

FIGURE 2 
A nondecompositional model of word-meaning representations (after Collins & Loftus, 
1975). Each node represents one concept. The wiring of the network is determined by semantic similarity. 
The links between the nodes represent the meaning relations between the~concepts. The strongest semantic 
relations exist between concepts with short and direct links. Activation can spread from one concept to 
another via the links. The more direct a link between nodes, the more activation is received from a node 
related in meaning. 
hearing the prime, its concept node gets activated and spreads parts of its activation 
to nearby nodes in the network. In this way, related words increase their levels of 
activation and require less processing time when these words are subsequently read 
or heard. This effect is very short-lasting, probably not longer than about 400 msec 
(Neely, 1977). 
In recent years, an increasing number of neurolinguistic priming studies have ap- 
peared in the literature. In these studies, either aphasic patients with impaired com- 
prehension or DAT patients were tested. These patients often show marked impair- 
ments when they are required to perform semantic judgments or other forms of explicit 
semantic evaluation. In marked contrast to their performance in explicit semantic tasks, 
a substantial number of studies report priming effects in such patients. In general, 
these priming effects have been taken as evidence that in many aphasic patients with 
semantic impairments, lexical-semantic representations are largely unaffected, but that 

246 
Peter Hagoort 
they have a problem in accessing these representations (see Hagoort, 1993, for an 
overview). For DAT patients the results of priming studies are less clear-cut, but the 
overall conclusion has been the same as for the aphasic patients (see Chenery, 1996, 
for an overview). However, for DAT patients the interpretation of the priming results 
is in contrast to conclusions based on their consistency scores (see Section 15-5.3). 
Overall, the results of priming studies with aphasic and DAT patients suggest that 
an access impairment underlies their semantic deficits. However, some caution is war- 
ranted with respect to the conclusions of these priming studies, since significant prim- 
ing effects as such are not necessarily clear evidence for an access deficit (cf. Moss 
& Tyler, 1995). I will discuss two concerns about the interpretation of priming effects. 
The first concern is related to the locus of the observed priming effects. Most 
patient studies used words that were related either associatively (e.g., bread-butter) 
or both associatively and semantically (e.g., dog-cat). These associations might be 
due to frequencies of co-occurrence in the language input, so it cannot be excluded 
that links between associatively related words exist at the level of word forms. In the 
absence of firm evidence that the priming effects actually arise at the concept level, 
significant priming effects in patients are insufficient evidence for the integrity of 
lexical-semantic (concept) representations. In a few studies, priming in purely seman- 
tically related word pairs (e.g., church-villa) was compared to priming in associatively 
related pairs (Hagoort, Brown, & Swaab, 1996; Ostrin & Tyler, 1993). The comforting 
outcome of these studies is that the aphasic patients showed the same pattern of results 
for both types of relations. 
A second concern is related to the priming mechanisms involved. Priming effects 
can be caused by quite different underlying processes (see for an overview, Neely, 
1991). The automatic spreading of activation between concept nodes in semantic mem- 
ory is one of the contributing mechanisms. But there are others, such as a postlexical 
matching of the prime and target for semantic overlap. This latter mechanism can 
easily explain priming under conditions of degraded representations. As has been 
observed by Warrington and others, in the absence of detailed semantic knowledge 
about a particular concept, patients still are often able to produce the category name 
(e.g., animal). It is exactly this kind of generic information that might be left intact 
in the case of a degraded semantic representation. Clearly, for pairs such as dog-cat 
a postlexical matching would still detect the category overlap, even in the absence of 
a more specific lexical-semantic structure. This illustrates the importance of testing 
priming under conditions that mainly or exclusively tap the spreading of activation 
through the lexical-semantic network itself (Hagoort, 1989, 1993). These conditions 
are realized by having very short time intervals between primes and targets, by pre- 
senting only relatively few related word pairs, and by avoiding as much as possible 
task components over and above the natural ones of listening or reading (Hagoort et 
al., 1996; Hagoort & Kutas, 1995). Priming that is obtained under these circumstances 
can be relatively safely interpreted as indicating intact lexical-semantic knowledge. 
Priming studies can substantially contribute to our understanding of the nature of 
the semantic impairment. One major advantage of the priming technique is the implicit 
nature of the task. What subjects are required to do (e.g., lexical decision, or, in the 

15 
Lexical-Semantic Processing 
247 
case of recording event-related brain potentials [ERP], just listening or reading) is in 
no way related to the actual question at stake, for example, whether or not patients 
are sensitive to the semantic relations between primes and targets. Sensitivity to or 
lack of sensitivity to these relations cannot easily be explained by reference to specific 
aspects of the task. However, priming studies will only contribute further to our un- 
derstanding of the nature of semantic deficits if an attempt is made to tap the full 
richness of lexical-semantic structure by testing a whole range of semantic relations 
(e.g., antonyms, category-member, co-hyponyms, and so forth) for concrete as well 
as abstract words. 
15-5.3. Consistency versus Priming 
The complexities of determining whether the impairment is due to an access problem 
or to degraded representations become especially clear in the case of Alzheimer pa- 
tients. On the basis of item consistency in their performance, it has been claimed that 
these patients suffer from a loss of semantic knowledge. However, the significant 
priming effects in most studies with DAT patients are taken as evidence for an access 
impairment (Chenery, 1996). Possible reasons for this inconsistency of results are that 
most priming studies with DAT patients have used only associatively related word 
pairs, that the presentation conditions of some studies have been insufficient to guar- 
antee the contribution of automatic spreading of activation to the priming effects, and 
that still other studies have found excessively large priming effects (hyperpriming). 
Hyperpriming is indicative of a representational deficit under the assumption that 
degraded representations benefit more from spreading activation provided by the prime 
than unaffected semantic representations (Chertkow, Bub, & Seidenberg, 1989). How- 
ever, Chenery (1996) has argued in her review that even when these factors are taken 
into consideration, the weight of evidence still favors an account in terms of an access 
impairment. Additional, finer-grained studies are needed to resolve the remaining in- 
consistencies and to determine the functional locus of semantic impairments in DAT 
patients. 
15-6. CONCLUDING 
REMARKS 
The literature on semantic impairments indicates that theories of lexical-semantic rep- 
resentations of nouns should be able to account for the qualitative differences in the 
semantics of abstract and concrete words, and for the perceptual versus functional 
attributes of different categories of concrete nouns. 
To date, most accounts of semantic impairments suffer from vagueness about the 
presupposed nature of lexical-semantic representations and lexical-semantic process- 
ing. Warrington and Cipolotti (1996) define semantic memory as "a system which 
processes, stores and retrieves information about the meaning of words, objects, facts 
and concepts" (p. 611). However, nothing is said about the nature of the semantic 
representations for words, objects, concepts, and facts. What are the differences and 

248 
Peter Hagoort 
commonalties between the semantic representations of these seemingly different mem- 
ory items? These are issues that need to be addressed as well. It is, however, an 
unfortunate aspect of the semantic memory tradition that the fractionation of semantic 
memory into different components has received more attention than the representa- 
tional structure of its content. Unless more explicit accounts of (lexical) semantics are 
given, it will remain difficult to decide whether patient data support explanations of 
semantic impairments in terms of multiple versus central semantic systems, in terms 
of access versus storage deficits, and so forth. 
With respect to impairments in the processing of lexical meaning, we also need a 
better understanding of what exactly our task configurations tap. One thing that has 
become clear in recent years from brain-imaging studies on language is that seemingly 
subtle task differences have overriding consequences on the patterns of brain activation 
obtained (e.g., Price et al., 1994). This should make us realize that for answering 
questions about the underlying nature of semantic impairments, we need to be more 
explicit about the requirements for performing the task at hand over and above ac- 
cessing lexical meaning. In essence, we often ask patients to solve a problem imposed 
by the experimenter, such as to match a word to a picture, to give a verbal definition 
on the basis of a picture or word input, or to pantomime a concept. Too often the 
peculiarities of these task requirements are not taken into consideration enough in the 
interpretation of the results. 
Finally, I have suggested that a revised version of Jackendoff's theory of lexical 
semantics (Jackendoff, 1983, 1987, 1992) might be able to account for most of the 
empirical data. According to Jackendoff, word meanings are decomposed into a re- 
stricted set of primitive conceptual features, paired with an abstract visual description 
(a 3-D model). I have proposed extending this account with other matched pairs of 
conceptual structure and nonvisual sensory models, and models of action specified in 
a format that is tailored to the requirements of the motor system. 
In my view, the major challenge of the coming years will be to close the gap 
between the intriguing findings in studies of different types of semantic impairment, 
the more recent brain-imaging data on semantic processing, psycholinguistic data on 
real-time processing of word meaning, and theories of word meaning. Only then will 
we begin to see the contours of a neurosemantic theory.

CHAPTER 16 
Disorders of Syntax in Aphasia 
Linguistic-Descriptive and 
Processing Approaches 
Herman Kolk 
Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information, University of Nijmegen. Nijmegen, The Netherlands 
Current research in the field of syntactic disorders takes one of the following two 
theoretical approaches. The first is to look for a theoretically based linguistic 
description that captures the empirical distinction between "affected" and "non- 
affected" linguistic behaviors. The group of agrammatic patients is typically the 
target of this approach. The second approach is to analyze the disorder of agram- 
matic and/or nonagrammatic patients in terms of processing limitations. Evidence 
obtained within each approach is reviewed separately for comprehension and pro- 
duction disorders. Discussion centers around linguistic concepts such as traces, 
case, and functional categories, as well as processing notions such as capacity, syn- 
tactic work space, and processing rate. In addition, the relevance of a number of 
dissociations is discussed. In conclusion, it is pointed out that the two approaches 
could merge into an integrated account of syntactic disorders in aphasia. 
Disorders of syntax in aphasia have most often been studied in Broca's aphasics and 
the term "agrammatism" has been used to refer to the difficulties in sentence pro- 
cessing that these patients exhibit. It is therefore natural to take this syndrome as a

starting point for the discussion. However, grammatical problems are apparent in fluent 
aphasics as well, and these will also enter our discussion. Usage of the term "agram- 
matic" does not imply that all patients referred to as such have a common deficit. In 
particular, as the result of Badecker and Caramazza's (1985) criticism of the concept 
of agrammatism, researchers have become more aware of the possibility of multiple 
deficits. This has resulted in an increasing number of individual case studies that 
suggested dissociations within the sentence processing system. A number of these 
dissociations will be discussed in this chapter. Perhaps the most convincing one is that 
between comprehension and production: several patients have been described who are 
agrammatic in production but unimpaired in sentence comprehension (Miceli, Maz- 
zucchi, Menn, & Goodglass, 1983; Kolk, van Grunsven, & Keyser, 1985; Nespoulous 
et al., 1988; Caramazza & Hillis, 1989b; Druks & Marshall, 1991). In view of this 
dissociation, I will treat disorders in each domain separately. 
The chapter is organized as follows: I begin with disorders of sentence compre- 
hension. Various linguistic approaches are reviewed, in particular the trace-deletion 
hypothesis and its reformulations, as well as a proposal that locates the deficit in the 
Case module. Then, a section follows on processing approaches to comprehension 
deficits, such as the mapping hypothesis and various proposals that assume a limited 
capacity for syntactic processing. The next section is on production. It begins with a 
brief summary of the main production parameters: morphology, sentence construction, 
and speech rate. Next, a number of linguistic and processing approaches are discussed, 
focusing on how they deal with the three production parameters. 
16-1. SENTENCE 
COMPREHENSION: 
THE LINGUISTIC-DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH 
16-1.1. The Trace-Deletion Hypothesis and Its Reformulations 
It has long been established that agrammatic patients have difficulties with sentence 
comprehension. These difficulties are apparent primarily if sentences are "reversible" 
(e.g., Caramazza & Zurif, 1976). A sentence is reversible if, after major noun phrases 
have exchanged position, the sentence still makes sense (e.g., "the dog is chewing 
the bone" is not reversible, but "the dog is chasing the cat" is). Not all reversible 
sentences are equally difficult, however. It is well known that active sentences are 
much easier than their passive counterparts (e.g., Schwartz, Saffran & Matin, 1980). 
To account for this within-category variation, Grodzinsky (1986, 1989, 1990) pro- 
posed that not the whole syntactic component is implicated (e.g., Caramazza & Zurif, 
1976), but only particular representational elements, the so-called traces. These traces 
result from movement transformations, according to the theory of Government and 
Binding--GB theory for short (Chomsky, 1981). For instance, in a passive sentence 
like "John was kissed by his mother," the D-structure has the NP "John" represented 
after the verb "kissed." In S-structure, "John" (also called an "argument" of the 
verb) is moved from the postverbal to the subject position. However, a trace of the 

16 
Aphasic Disorders of Syntax 
251 
moved argument is left behind and this trace carries an index. The presence of traces 
becomes critical at a later stage, when "roles" are assigned ("who does what to 
whom"). In the case of the passive, the assignment algorithm expects the NP playing 
the "theme" role (the entity affected by the action) to be at its D-structure position, 
that is, right after the verb, and does not find it. However, it does find a trace with an 
index. The subject NP (John) is found to carry the same index, and therefore the 
theme role can be assigned to the proper NP. 
Grodzinsky postulates that these traces are absent from the agrammatic represen- 
tations (hence, "trace-deletion hypothesis," or TDH). As an immediate consequence, 
normal assignment of moved arguments is no longer possible. However, assignment 
of nonmoved arguments is unimpaired. Thus, in the case of the passive, the agent role 
can be assigned by parsing the by-phrase. One would expect that with verbs like 
"kiss," which take two arguments, the theme role would be assigned to the remaining 
NP, "the boy." Such an assignment is overruled, however, by the obligatory appli- 
cation of a word-order heuristic. According to the "default principle," whenever the 
first NP of a clause has not received a thematic role as a consequence of trace deletion, 
it is automatically assigned the agentmor some other appropriatemrole. But the agent 
role is already assigned to the NP in the by-phrase. Hence a conflict arises, which the 
patient is assumed to resolve by guessing. This guessing results in chance-level per- 
formance, which Grodzinsky claims to be present with all sentences having moved 
arguments and noncanonical word order. Thus chance-level performance would be 
observed with passives, object relatives, and object clefts (e.g., "it was the boy that 
the mother kissed"). Above-chance-level performance would be present with sen- 
tences having moved arguments but canonical word order, such as subject relatives 
(e.g., "the boy that kissed the girl was tall") and subject clefts (e.g., "it was the girl 
that kissed the boy"). 
Grodzinsky's work has stimulated others to look at agrammatic comprehension 
from the point of view of theoretical linguistics (cf. Hickok & Avrutin, 1996; Frazier 
& Macnamara, 1995; Saddy, 1995). Here we will concentrate on the research directly 
related to the TDH. One relevant criticism that has been leveled against this hypothesis 
concerns the default principle. Since the heuristic is not based on grammatical prin- 
ciples, why would the agrammatics stick to the agent-first heuristic, even if it is in 
conflict with information obtained from role assignment to unmoved arguments? This 
was one important reason for the development of two reformulations of the TDH, one 
by Hickok (Hickok, 1992; Hickok, Zurif, & Canseco-Gonzales, 1993) and the other 
by Mauner, Fromkin, and Cornell (1993). There are a number of differences between 
these two proposals with respect to linguistic representation, but both replace the 
default principle with strategy, by which the patients choose between the possibilities 
that remain after direct assignment has been made. 
Another major criticism concerns the empirical evidence for the TDH. First of all, 
comprehension is not as predicted in the case of (a) passives without a by-phrase 
(Martin, Frederick-Wetzel, Blossom-Stack, & Feher, 1989), (b) Hebrew passives with 
postverbal subjects (Druks & Marshall, 1991), and (c) the matrix clause of sentences 
with a center-embedded relative clause (Hickok et al., 1993; Kolk, & Weijts, 1996). 

252 
Herman Kolk 
Second, passives elicit chance-level performance only in a subset (roughly one-third) 
of agrammatic patients, as has been shown by Berndt, Mitchum, and Haendiges (1996) 
in a meta-analysis of 64 patients, described in the literature. 
16-1.2. The Case-Deficit Hypothesis 
Of particular interest is a subset of patients in the Berndt et al. study (1996), the ones 
that performed better on passives than on actives. Druks and Marshall (1995) reported 
on one other case of this kind, B.M., who performed at chance on actives and above 
chance on passives, on three different kinds of comprehension tests. Another patient, 
M.H., showed the reverse (TDH) pattern. To account for both performances within 
one linguistic framework, Druks and Marshall propose an alternative to the TDH. It 
holds that the Case module, as defined in GB theory, is impaired in agrammatic 
patients. GB theory distinguishes between two types of Case. First, there is structural 
Case, which is assigned at the level of S-structure. Examples are nominative and 
accusative Case. In English, these Cases are morphologically expressed only occa- 
sionally (e.g. "he" and "him"). Second, there is inherent Case, a lexical phenomenon, 
assigned at D-structure by prepositions. Inherent Case is not expressed in English, but 
it is in other languages (e.g., German: "in dem Glass"--in the [dative] glass). In the 
passive by-phrase, "by" assigns inherent case to the embedded NP. Without appro- 
priate Case assignment, thematic role assigment is disrupted and comprehension is 
impaired. Druks and Marshall propose that in patients such as M.H., with chance 
performance on passives and above chance on actives, inherent Case is impaired; when 
the reverse pattern is observed, as in B.M., the impairment would be in structural case 
assignment. A difficulty with this account is that B.M. is significantly below chance 
on passives in two out of three tests. Therefore, Druks and Marshall are forced to 
invoke an agent-first heuristic. They claim that B.M. follows this strategy because he 
would be impaired in both types of case. In M.H., on the other hand, who obviously 
does not employ the strategy (he is at chance in actives), the use of the strategy is 
blocked because M.H. has only one type of impairment. It is important to realize, 
however, that, just as with Grodzinsky, the use or nonuse of the strategy is not lin- 
guistically motivated. Furthermore, it is not psychologically motivated either. In par- 
ticular, why would a patient with "only" a structural Case impairment not follow the 
strategy if this is the only way he can make sense out of an active sentence? The 
notion of a word-order heuristic appears to be a stumbling block for this approach, 
as it is for Grodzinsky's (cf. Zurif, 1996; Druks & Marshall, 1996). 
16-2. SENTENCE 
COMPREHENSION: 
THE PROCESSING APPROACH 
16-2.1. Mapping Deficit or Limited Capacity? 
Grammatical difficulties exhibited by agrammatic patients not only vary with sentence 
type but also depend on the type of task. One important type of task variation was 

16 
Aphasic Disorders of Syntax 
253 
discovered by Linebarger, Schwartz, and Saffran (1983). These authors demonstrated 
that agrammatics who perform at chance on sentence-picture-matching tasks with 
reversible passives can obtain very high scores on a task in which they are asked to 
indicate whether a sentence is grammatical or not, not only with passive sentences 
but with other complex sentences as well (Linebarger, Schwartz, & Saffran, 1983; see 
also Linebarger, 1989, 1990, 1995). This result is difficult to explain for Grodzinsky's 
and Hickok's hypotheses, although not for the one proposed by Mauner et al., dis- 
cussed in the previous section. According to Linebarger et al., (1983), there are two 
ways to account for this dissociation between comprehension and judgment. The first 
is that the agrammatic problem is not in parsing but in mapping the syntactic repre- 
sentation onto a semantic one. The second is a limited-capacity hypothesis, which 
holds that comprehension, requiring both parsing and mapping, overloads the pro- 
cessing capacity of the agrammatic patient; for judgment, requiring only parsing, there 
is enough capacity. Schwartz, Linebarger, Saffran, and Pate (1987) rejected the 
limited-capacity hypothesis because, in their group of agrammatic patients, they only 
found an effect of canonicity and not an effect of phrase-structure complexity. Kolk 
and Weijts (1996), however, maintained that this rejection was premature, because 
with another operationalization of complexity (embedding instead of conjoining of 
sentences) and a control of strategy effects, they did observe a complexity effect, 
which was as large as the canonicity effect. 
One advantage of the limited-capacity notion is that, since the limitation can vary 
in degree, variation in severity can be accounted for (Caplan, Baker, & Dehaut, 1985; 
Kolk & van Grunsven, 1985). This feature contrasts sharply with the linguistic ap- 
proach, which applies only to patients with chance-level performance on critical sen- 
tence types. 
Quite a number of recent proposals can be considered as variants of the capacity 
approach. The one that corresponds most closely to the Linebarger et al. (1983) pro- 
posal is the Just and Carpenter capacity theory of language comprehension (cf. Just 
& Carpenter, 1992; Miyake, Carpenter, & Just, 1994; see Haarmann, Just, & Carpenter, 
in press, for a computer model). Miyake et al. (1994) presented normal subjects with 
sentences under heavy time constraint (120 or 180 ms per word). They found that the 
rank order of difficulty over sentence types, varying from simple to complex, was 
very similar to the one found by Caplan et al. (1985) for an unselected group of 
aphasics. Furthermore, there was a large effect of "severity": subjects who scored 
relatively low on a language capacity test (the so-called reading span test) made many 
more errors than subjects who scored relatively high. Miyake et al. (1994) conclude 
that there is a single limitation in working memory capacity that can vary in severity 
and that underlies not only variation in comprehension ability within the normal pop- 
ulation but also aphasic sentence comprehension; perhaps the comprehension diffi- 
culties of older people can be accounted for in this way as well (Carpenter, Miyake, 
& Just, 1994). 
Of special interest is Miyake et al.'s (1994) finding that different subgroups showed 
different performance profiles: a particular sentence type could be relatively easy for 
one subgroup but relatively hard for another, thus creating a "double dissociation" 

254 
Herman Kolk 
within unimpaired normal adults. Some of these dissociations dissappeared after re- 
peated testing, whereas others remained stable over time. These findings present a 
challenge to the way in which behavioral dissociations in neurolinguistic patients are 
routinely ascribed to specific deficits at the level of particular components of the 
language system. As Miyake et al. suggest, a particular neurolinguistic dissociation 
could also be due to stochastic noise (Haarmann & Kolk, 1991a; McClelland, 
1993)--unless, of course, it is demonstrated to be stable over time, which is not always 
donemor to consistent idiosyncratic comprehension strategies. 
16-2.2. Capacity Limitation: General or Specific? 
The Just and Carpenter capacity theory has been called into question by Caplan and 
his colleagues. They tested sentence comprehension in Alzheimer patients, who pre- 
sumably also suffer from such a language capacity reduction. It was found that per- 
formance in these patients was poorer only for sentences that had two propositions 
(described two events) as compared to one. There was no effect of canonicity; that 
is, in contrast with what is generally found with aphasics, sentences with noncanonical 
word order (e.g., passives or cleft objects such as "it was the dog that the horse 
passed") were not significantly harder than sentences with canonical word order but 
that included the same number of words, propositions, verbs, and thematic roles (Ro- 
chon, Waters, & Caplan, 1994). Even when a dual task (digit recall) is added--which, 
according to Just & Carpenter (1992), should reduce the amount of capacity available 
for parsing--a canonicity effect does not arise (Waters, Caplan, & Rochon, 1995). 
This dissociation between canonicity and number of propositions suggests that we 
must distinguish between (at least) two kinds of language-related capacity: a purely 
syntactic one, and one that deals with verbal reasoning. A similar picture arises from 
a study by Martin and Romani (1994). They looked at the effect of adding extra 
material to sentences on performance in two tasks: a sentence-picture matching and 
a grammaticality judgment task. A.B., an aphasic patient, showed an effect only on 
matching; another aphasic patient, M.W., did so only on judgment. This dissociation 
again supports the existence of separate capacities for syntactic and semantic analysis. 
(For more discussion on the Just and Carpenter theory, see Caplan & Waters, 1995; 
Martin, 1995; Miyake et al., 1995; Waters & Caplan, 1996.) 
In line with these latter findings, a number of researchers have claimed that the 
capacity limitation in aphasic patients is restricted to parsing (cf. Kolk & van Gruns- 
ven, 1985; Caplan & Hildebrandt, 1988; Shankweiler, Crain, Gorell, & Tuller, 1989; 
Friederici & Frazier, 1992). The parsing limitation is thought to apply to agrammatics 
only (e.g., Friederici & Frazier, 1992; Zurif, Swinney, Prather, Solomon, & Bushel, 
1993), to agrammatic as well as paragrammatic (Wernicke) patients (Kolk & Fried- 
erici, 1985), or to all aphasics with comprehension disorders (Caplan & Hildebrandt, 
1988). Parsing, of course, is still a multifaceted phenomenon, and it is conceivable 
that capacity limitation is even more selective. Zurif et al. (1993), for instance, assume 
that the capacity limitation underlying the parsing difficulties of agrammatics is ba- 
sically a lexical one. Or, to take another example, normal parsing requires rapid access 

16 
Aphasic Disorders of Syntax 
255 
to the thematic properties of verbs, but the capacity to do so does not seem to be 
reduced in agrammatics (Shapiro & Levine, 1990; Shapiro, Gordon, Hack, & Kil- 
lackey, 1993). 
Specific-capacity approaches vary with respect to the nature of the limitation: spa- 
tial or temporal. Caplan & Hildebrandt (1988) put forward an account of the first 
typem"the parsing work space" hypothesis: aphasics would be limited in the size of 
their syntactic buffer. Temporal hypotheses generally come in two kinds. It is assumed 
either that activation of grammatical information is slowed down (Gigley, 1983; Kolk 
& van Grunsven, 1985; Friederici, 1988; Friederici & Kilborn, 1989; Haarmann & 
Kolk, 1991a, 1991b; Hagoort, 1997; Cornell, 1995; Swaab, Brown, & Hagoort, 1997; 
Swinney, & Zurif, 1995) or that the parsing results are subject to pathologically fast 
decay (Gigley, 1983; Kolk & van Grunsven, 1985; Haarmann & Kolk, 1994). A 
similar distinction between slow activation and fast decay has been made by Schwartz, 
Dell, Martin, and Saffran (1994) in a computer simulation study of aphasic word 
production. 
What the proper characterization of the nature and domain of the processing lim- 
itation is is still a matter of debate (see Kolk & Weijts, 1996, for an overview). For 
one thing, not all hypotheses account equally well for the judgment data. Second, the 
effect of canonicity may be due to extra computational load, along with the effect of 
phrase-structure complexity, or to the effect of word-order strategy, since such a strat- 
egy facilitates processing of sentences with canonical word order at the expense of 
sentences with noncanonical word order. 
16-3. SENTENCE PRODUCTION: 
THREE PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS 
Discussions about agrammatic disorders of sentence production center around three 
manifestations of this deficit. The best known is the morphological aspect: agrammatic 
patients tend to omit or substitute grammatical morphology. Grammatical morphology 
refers to both free (function words) and bound morphemes (inflections). It is also 
referred to as "closed-class" morphology, because its number is relatively fixed in a 
given language. The closed-class vocabulary is not impaired as a whole, however: 
there is considerable within-category variation (DeVilliers, 1974; Menn & Obler, 
1990; Haarmann & Kolk, 1992). (I will come back to this within-category variation 
later.) The production of derivational morphology (-ion in destruction) need not be 
impaired (Micelli & Caramazza, 1988). The "open-class" vocabulary (content words) 
is relatively spared, but it has often been noted that Broca's aphasics have more 
difficulty with verbs than with nouns in naming tasks; several anomics show the 
reverse problem (McCarthy & Warrington, 1985; Miceli, Silveri, Villa, & Caramazza, 
1984; Zingeser & Berndt, 1990). It is important to realize, however, that fluent apha- 
sics are also reported to have more difficulties with verbs than with nouns (Berndt 
1991; Williams, & Canter, 1987). For more detailed analysis of verb impairment in 
aphasia, the reader is referred to Kegl (1995) and Breedin and Martin (1996). 

256 
Herman Kolk 
The other aspect is constructional; it corresponds with what Goodglass and Kaplan 
(1983) call "reduced variety of grammatical form." In Broca's aphasics, this variety 
is very limited and we typically observe declarative sentences with canonical word 
order, no embedding or phrasal elaboration, and little tendency to add adjuncts in the 
form of prepositional phrases, adverbs, or nonfinite verb complements (cf. Goodglass, 
Christiansen, & Gallagher, 1994). 
There is a third aspect that is commonly associated with agrammatism in produc- 
tion: slow rate of speech (nonfluency). Saffran, Berndt, and Schwartz (1989), for in- 
stance, observed a speech rate of about 30 words per minute in their agrammatic 
group, versus 130 in their controls. Although agrammatics typically have articula- 
tory impairment, speech rate can also be reduced in patients without such impair- 
ment. This suggests a relation between speech rate and sentence production 
impairment. 
Although these three aspects typically go together in agrammatic speakers, disso- 
ciations have been reported. Most critical are the two cases that are sometimes claimed 
to demonstrate normal syntax and impaired morphology (Miceli, Mazzuchi, Menn, & 
Goodglass, 1983; Kolk et al., 1985). The speech of both patients, however, was char- 
acterized by a high number of finiteness omissions: clauses that either lacked a verb 
(e.g., "because a big pain in the chest") or had only a nonfinite verb (infinitive or 
past participle; e.g., "But not feel [inf.] well, always have [inf.] these pains here"). 
For such clauses, it is hard to argue that they are syntactically "normal": in the 
absence of finiteness, there is no evidence that a sentence has been produced. A 
convincing case of normal syntax and seriously impaired morphology has not yet been 
observed. 
16-4. AGRAMMATIC PRODUCTION: 
THE LINGUISTIC-DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH 
I will start with the morphological aspect. Until recently, linguistic approaches to 
agrammatic production treated the closed-class vocabulary as a whole (e.g., Kean, 
1977; Grodzinsky, 1984, 1986). Hagiwara (1994, 1995), however, has made a proposal 
that does accommodate to within-category variation. Her account follows recent de- 
velopments in generative linguistic theory (Pollock, 1989; Chomsky, 1993). It extends 
to agrammatic comprehension, but I will focus on production. The basic claim is that 
agrammatic production is caused by an impairment of functional categories. Func- 
tional categories refer to those nodes in the phrase-structure hierarchy that dominate 
grammatical morphology. The AGR-node, for example, dominates agreement mor- 
phology of the verb; the C-node dominates complementizers such as that, if, whether 
and for, which introduce an embedded clause. Each node has its position at a particular 
level in the hierarchy. C-nodes, for instance, are located higher in the tree than AGR- 
nodes. Every patient can be characterized as having a deficit with respect to a partic- 
ular level in the hierarchy. Grammatical morphemes dependent on nodes lower than 

16 
Aphasic Disorders of Syntax 
257 
this level are spared, whereas the ones dependent on higher nodes are affected. This 
explains the existence of the within-category variation referred to earlier (though not 
necessarily its specific form). Hagiwara, for instance, showed that her Japanese agram- 
matics did not omit negation (dependent on a relatively low NEG-node) but did omit 
complementizers (dependent on the much higher C-node). 
Of particular interest is the connection Hagiwara assumes between this linguistic 
description and processing capacity. Structures dominated by lower nodes would re- 
quire a fundamental structure-building operation called "Merge" (Chomsky, 1994) to 
be carried out fewer times. These structures are therefore more economical and more 
accessible to the agrammatic. Agrammatics suffer from a reduced linguistic capacity 
to carry out this operation, and the amount of reduction determines at what level in 
the hierarchy functional categories become inaccessible. Hagiwara thus has an account 
of severity variation, which, as we saw earlier, was absent from linguistic-descriptive 
approaches to agrammatic comprehension. 
A related proposal has been put forward by Friedmann and Grodzinsky (1994, 
1997). They report on a Hebrew-speaking patient who, in sentence repetition and 
sentence completion tasks, makes almost no errors with subject-verb agreement but 
makes many errors with tense (a mismatch between a temporal adverb and the verbal 
inflection). Friedmann and Grodzinsky account for this dissociation by assuming that 
in the syntactic tree, AGR-nodes are located lower than T(ense)-nodes, which domi- 
nate tense-related morphology, and that their patient has a deficit at the level of T. 
Like Hagiwara, they assume that different patients can have impairments at different 
levels in the hierarchy, and that the higher the level, the greater the number of gram- 
matical elements that are affected. They do not conceive of this severity variation as 
being a variation in the amount of available capacity. Instead, they assume that if a 
patient has an impairment with respect to a particular node, higher levels are also 
affected because, in the process of verb movement, the verb cannot cross over the 
impaired node. 
Besides the morphological aspect, we have the constructional and the fluency aspect 
to deal with. With respect to the latter, I can be brief: nonfluency has received little 
or no attention from theoretical linguists. Regarding the constructional difficulties, 
the functional-category hypothesis suggests that complementizers, depending on 
(high-level) C-nodes, will be impaired, with the consequence that sentence embed- 
ding is prohibited, at least in languages that require such complementizers (Fried- 
mann & Grodzinsky, 1997). Finally, Hagiwara's hypothesis predicts that phrasal 
elaboration will also be limited. It is known, for instance, that agrammatics have 
difficulties with double-adjective constructions (e.g., "a large white house"; cf. 
Gleason, Goodglass, Ackerman, Green & Hyde, 1975), with noun phrases that in- 
clude a prepositional phrase, and with compound nouns (Luzatti and De B leser, 
1996). Complex noun phrases like this would require more capacity than is availa- 
ble to the agrammatic. In this way, at least some aspects of syntactic simplification 
could be accounted for by the same principles invoked to explain the morphological 
difficulties. 

258 
Herman Kolk 
16-5. AGRAMMATIC 
PRODUCTION: 
THE PROCESSING APPROACH 
My exposition of the processing approach begins with the morphological difficulties. 
We saw an example of such an approach earlier: Hagiwara's hypothesis that particular 
syntactic nodes are less accessible to the agrammatic. In the same vein, both Stem- 
berger (1984) and Lapointe (1985) have proposed a reduced availability of syntactic 
structures to underlie agrammatic production. However, neither presents an explicit 
account for within-category variation. In the processing theory worked out by Kolk 
and his colleagues, on the other hand, an attempt is made to explain this variation as 
a side effect of the reduced access/availability of syntactic structures. 
In this theory, changes in internal syntactic processing rate are supposed to underlie 
production difficulties, in the same way as this was postulated for comprehension (see 
earlier). These temporal changes are thought to have two effects. First, slow activation 
and/or fast decay of phrase structure information would cause desynchronization of 
parts of the syntactic tree, just as in the Haarmann and Kolk (1991 a) model of agram- 
matic comprehension (Kolk, 1987). Synchrony would be more difficult to achieve, 
the greater the complexity of the phrase structure to be produced. A second effect 
occurs in, for instance, simple structures, in which synchrony is obtained in spite of 
the slow activation. In such situations, phrase-structure delivery is still slower than in 
the normal speaker. Now, correct production of grammatical morphology requires 
another kind of synchrony: that between a syntactic slot (e.g., the DET slot) and 
the lexical item (e.g., "the"). If slot delivery is delayed, the lexical element is 
already decaying and is suffering from response competition with other lexical items. 
If a morpheme is selected at this stage, there is a high chance that it will be an 
erroneous one. 
Within this model, variation within the closed-class vocabulary is explained as 
follows. Slots that are dependent on a relatively complex part of the syntactic tree 
will be delivered later. For the production of a plural inflection, for instance, the 
minimally required structure is an NP, whereas for a verb inflection, an S-node is 
required: accordingly, plural noun inflection is easier than verb inflection (Goodglass 
& Berko, 1960; Haarmann and Kolk, 1992). Kolk (1995) indicates how other within- 
category differences, observed by Haarmann & Kolk (1992), can be explained as 
effects of syntactic complexity. 
Besides morphological difficulties, there is the symptom of syntactic simplification 
capacity approaches have to deal with. According to Kolk (1995), the higher the 
degree of complexity, the higher the chance of desynchronization within the syn- 
tactic tree. As a consequence, the chance that an agrammatic patient will success- 
fully produce a complex phrase or sentence is relatively low. Thus, in this theory, 
the distinction between "morphological" and "syntactic" agrammatism (cf. Saf- 
fran, Berndt, & Schwartz, 1989) is one of degree. The bias agrammatic patients 
have toward canonical word order can be explained by assuming that, for the pro- 
duction of noncanonical word order, extra processing time is required, connected, 

16 
Aphasic Disorders of Syntax 
259 
for instance, to a movement operation or to the production of a less frequent 
structure. Consistent with this hypothesis is Kolk and van Grunsven's (1985) dem- 
onstration that the production of noncanonical word order is dependent on syntactic 
complexity. 
16-5.1. The Role of Adaptive Strategies 
One empirical phenomenon in agrammatic speech is not yet accounted for: the effect 
of task variation. It has been demonstrated that, at least in Dutch- and German- 
speaking agrammatics, the speech output observed in free conversations radically dif- 
fers from the output during constrained tasks such as the cloze task and various forms 
described earlier and various forms of picture description tasks (Kolk & Heeschen, 
1992; Hofstede & Kolk, 1994; see also Nespoulous & Dordain, 1991 for a study in 
French; for a partial failure to replicate this result in English, see Hesketh & Bishop, 
1996; for a criticism of this study, see Kolk & Heeschen, 1996). In particular, in free 
speech, one almost exclusively observes omissions of function words, whereas in 
constrained tasks, the number of omissions goes down and that of substitutions goes 
up: the speech pattern changes from agrammatic to paragrammatic. Similar shifts have 
been reported to occur spontaneously (Bastiaanse, 1995) and upon request (Kolk & 
Hofstede, 1994). To explain this task effect, an economy hypothesis is proposed: in 
free speech, the patients adapt the syntactic complexity of their utterances to their 
limited capacity. They would do this by employing a subset of the normal inventory 
of syntactic forms, the production of which requires less capacity: the repertoire of 
ellipsis. This is the repertoire normal speakers use when they want to be very brief: 
in informal conversations (e.g., "everything paid") or in addressing children 
("naughty girl!"), or among foreigners ("passport not good"). In accordance with 
this hypothesis, Kolk and Heeschen (1992) have shown that the morpho-syntactic 
properties of normal ellipsis and agrammatic speech largely overlap. In the output 
observed in constrained tasks, when patients are adapting to a lesser extent, the ellip- 
tical features are less prominent; in fact, their outputmat least at the morphological 
levelmis not very different from the output of fluent Wernicke patients (Kolk & 
Heeschen, 1992). This suggests that Broca's and Wernicke's have a similar grammat- 
ical impairment, but that their spontaneous speech is so different (agrammatic in the 
first case and "paragrammatic" in the second) because Broca's adapt to their perform- 
ance and Wernicke's~for some reason~do not (Heeschen, 1985; Kolk & Heeschen, 
1990). In accordance with this prediction, Haarmann and Kolk (1992) observed that 
the difficulty profile for the various types of morphology that they studied was the 
same for their group of Broca and Wernicke patients. 
The adaptation approach also offers a processing account for an aspect of sentence 
production not yet discussed: nonfluency. Kolk and van Grunsven (1985) have sug- 
gested that nonfluency, just as telegraphic speech, is a symptom of adaptation. Ac- 
cording to Kolk (1995), when the generation of a phrase structure is disrupted, this 
process is simply restarted. Since the process can profit from rest activation that 

260 
Herman Kolk 
remains from previous attempts, restarting leads to a higher chance of successful 
encoding (for some experimental evidence, see Kolk & Hofstede 1994). 
16-6. CONCLUSION 
We have discussed two approaches to syntactic disorders in aphasia. Linguistic pro- 
posals with respect to comprehension deficits involve the representation of traces and 
Case. Apart from the question of what type of representation is affected in what 
patient, these proposals may suffer from two shortcomings. First, there is no room for 
severity variation. Second, the status of word-order heuristics is not clear, neither 
empirically, nor theoretically. Processing approaches to comprehension disorders vary 
in (a) the domain of the presumed capacity limitation (e.g., language comprehension 
versus syntactic analysis) and (b) the nature of the limitation (spatial or temporal). 
Severity variation is explained by assuming variation in available capacity. Here too, 
however, there is uncertainty about the role of word-order heuristics. In particular, the 
effect of canonicity may be due to extra computational load, along with the effect of 
phrase-structure complexity, or to the effect of strategy. Both linguistic and processing 
approaches to production disorders have involved attempts to explain variation within 
the category of grammatical morphemes. In both proposals, the notion of phrase- 
structure hierarchy plays a crucial role: either a particular node is selectively damaged, 
or processing of structure up to that node overloads the processing system. The two 
accounts appear closely related. This similarity suggests that linguistic and processing 
approaches could well merge into an integrated theory of aphasic disorders of syntax 
not only in production but also in comprehension. Such a theory should specify: (a) 
the linguistic representations involved, (b) the computational load connected to the 
processing of these representations, (c) the "capacity bottlenecks" in aphasia: in what 
aspects of sentence processing capacity demand is higher than what is available to a 
particular patient or group of patients, and (d) the strategies employed by particular 
patients under particular conditions to circumevent the consequences of capacity lim- 
itations."

Language is used to communicate. In this chapter, some discourse-level compo- 
nents and processes of verbal communication are examined, with a focus on 
narrative and conversational discourses. The theoretical frameworks of discourse 
are introduced in the first section, where the importance of Kintsch and van 
Dijk's model of discourse comprehension is critically acknowledged and the im- 
portance of context in conversation is stressed. In the second section, the main 
findings of recent neurolinguistic studies devoted to discourse troubles in aphasia, 
right-hemisphere damage, and dementia of the Alzheimer type are reviewed. The 
conclusion emphasizes the need for clinical research to be inspired by theoretical 
discourse models, as complex as they are, since they integrate all cognitive abil- 
ities required for interpersonal communication. 
The capacity to communicate with others implies more than the mere apposition 
of sounds or the ability to construct correct sentences. Specifically, one needs to 
cogitate the message to be expressed or understand the message that has been received,

one has to organize the elements of information into connected speech, and one must 
take into consideration the general and the specific contexts in which this exchange 
takes place. Discourse-level components and verbal communication processes refer to 
these fundamental aspects of language as a means of communication. It is essential 
that these aspects be considered since acquired language impairments are increasingly 
examined in the context of the handicap situations they generate for the individuals 
in their everyday life (Lacroix, Joanette, & Bois, 1994). 
The incorporation of discourse-level aspects of cognition into neurolinguistics is 
relatively recent. In fact, conceptual frameworks and tools addressing these compo- 
nents and processes have only been systematized with the joint evolution of thought 
in the philosophy of language, text linguistics, sociolinguistics, and cognitive psy- 
chology. Because incorporating a discourse perspective in neurolinguistic research is 
still under construction, the second section of this chapter will provide the reader with 
the most frequently referred to theoretical frameworks. 1 The third section is devoted 
to the contribution of these discourse-level frameworks within the current status of 
neurolinguistics. Such a contribution will be examplified through a series of studies 
that have examined narrative or conversational impairments in individuals with ac- 
quired brain lesions. 
17-1. THEORETICAL 
FRAMEWORKS 
OF 
NARRATIVE 
AND CONVERSATIONAL 
DISCOURSE 
Discourse can be defined as a sequence of natural language expressions representing 
a piece of conceptual knowledge that a speaker/writer wants to communicate to a 
listener/reader. There are several types of discourse, such as narrative, conversational, 
procedural, descriptive, argumentative or expository, the first two having been the 
most looked at among patients with acquired brain damage. Narrative discourse is, by 
far, the type of discourse that has generated the largest number of models and theories. 
On the other hand, until recently, conversational discourse had not been widely studied 
in neurolinguistics nor had it benefited from a comprehensive and global theoretical 
framework. It is being increasingly examined as it is believed to be more represen- 
tative of natural language. 
17-1.1. Aspects of Narrative Discourse 
Historically, at least in aphasiology and in neurolinguistics, narrative discourse was 
primarily the object of formal measures. Presently, however, it is obvious that the 
analysis of surface parameters such as lexical and morphosyntactical measures (e.g., 
verb or adjective/noun ratio, Type-Token ratio, mean length of utterance, mean num- 
ber of clauses, or analyses of syntactical complexity) corresponds not only to a very

Atkinson and Heritage (1984), and van Dijk (1985).

partial approach of discourse but also one that misses its essence, namely, its semantic 
organization. This is not the case for measures of cohesion, such as the correct use 
of pronominal reference (anaphora and cataphora), ellipsis, lexical repetition, substi- 
tution, synonymy, and conjunctions. In fact, the semantic organization of discourse is 
expressed through the appropriate use of these cohesive forms, which are tightly linked 
with a coherent representation of the discourse in the speaker's mind and a coherent 
interpretation by the addressee. 
17-1.1.1. Structure versus Content: Story Grammar, Scripts, Schemata, 
and Causal Networks 
In the mid-seventies, scholars such as Mandler and Johnson (1977) attempted to trans- 
pose the generative grammar approach to discourse by formalizing the regularities 
they found in narratives. They proposed a set of rules involving a finite set of supra- 
phrasic units (episodes: setting, goal, attempt, outcome, ending, and so forth) related 
by a finite set of relations, such as causality and temporal sequence. This underlying 
structure of stories was assumed to be invariable and independent of the content of 
specific stories. A mental counterpart, the story schema, was invoked to account for 
comprehension, memorization, and production of stories. Alhough the notion of a 
narrative structure was heuristic, this approach rapidly appeared to be too simplistic 
and not in accordance with actual story processing. 
Other researchers argued that the mental representation of a text first and foremost 
depended on its content, and that the text superstructure proposed by story grammar- 
ians was only a by-product of a content-based organization. With the concept of script, 
Schank and Abelson (1977) asserted that knowledge about common situations (e.g., 
going to a restaurant and ordering a meal) did not need a superstructure but rather 
was a sequence of concrete scenes in which typical roles perform specific actions. 
The importance of causal relationships (a global plan subdivided into a sequence of 
goals and subgoals) and the chronological progress between events was also empha- 
sized. Schank and Abelson proposed the concept of causal network in which the most 
important events are those more closely connected to other events in the story. Al- 
though appealing, causal networks are restricted to situations where strong causal 
relations exist between events; moreover, none of the approaches mentioned until now 
have dealt with the cognitive processing of stories. 
17-1.1.2. The Cognitive Processing of Narrative Discourse 
The distinction between microstructure and macrostructure proposed by Kintsch and 
van Dijk has been of great heuristic value (Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978). Using narrative 
recall as a basic task, text comprehension is viewed as a real-time process constrained 
by the limited capacity of short-term memory (STM) that proceeds in cycles, with 
only one clause or proposition in STM at any one time. Reading or listening to a 
narrative starts with microprocessing, that is, parsing the text into micropropositions 
formed by one predicate, such as a verb, and one or more of its arguments, such as 

264 
Yves Chantraine et al. 
an agent, goal, or object. These micropropositions are linked together if they share 
one argument and if they co-occur in STM. The thematically more important propo- 
sitions stay in STM for several cycles, where they are hierarchically organized into a 
network, with a topical proposition as the superordinate node. The reader attempts to 
represent a text with a given network; if there is a lack of argument overlap, s/he 
searches for the missing propositions in long-term memory or makes inferences 2 to 
complete this single network. Otherwise, s/he creates a new network. The next step 
in this top-down process consists of building the macrostructure of the text. 
In macroprocessing, the most relevant micropropositions are retained, generalized, 
or constructed in the form of macropropositions. The resulting macrostructure of the 
text is composed of an ordered set of macropropositions, which constitutes the unified 
underlying semantic representation of the text. In addition to microstructure and ma- 
crostructure, the text base also includes superstructure information retrieved from long- 
term memory. This abstract cognitive superstructure consists of the conventional el- 
ements from the different types of discourse (e.g., for narratives: setting, complication, 
and resolution) as well as scripts. 
Kintsch and van Dijk's model was partially validated by several experiments. It 
also attracted criticisms, two of which should be mentioned. First, it has been argued 
that the argument overlap in STM is insufficient to account for textual coherence. In 
fact, coherence can be local (intrasentential and actualized by cohesive ties) or global, 
and referred to as contextual plausibility; in this second case, the story as a whole is 
linked with the reader's general knowledge about the world. Actually, it has been 
shown that a text could be locally coherent through the correct use of cohesive ties 
while absolutely implausible on a global level (Garnham, Oakhill, & Johnson-Laird, 
1982). 
The main criticism, however, concerns the propositional representations of both 
micro- and macrostructure and their overdependence on the text. Kintsch and van Dijk 
were considered to have underestimated the role of world knowledge, not only in 
making inferences or in maintaining coherence, but more generally, in the construction 
of a mental model of the story, a level of representation that is independent of the 
linguistic structure of the text (Ehrlich & Tardieu, 1993). Although van Dijk and 
Kintsch (1983) did propose a "situation model" that was presumed to be separate 
from the macrostructure, it was considered too largely propositional and still too 
text-based. In 1988, Kintsch eventually advanced a connectionist "Construction- 
Integration" model of discourse comprehension. In this approach, there is a loose and 
context-free Construction step whose nodes and links are possibly weak or ambiguous. 
Then, through spreading activation, an Integration step taking discourse context into 
2As noted by Kintsch (1993), inference is not a unitary phenomenon. Some inferences are 
uncontrolled (e.g., automatic bridging inferences) while others are controlled. In these two catego- 
ries, some inferences generate new information while others expand on knowledge from long-term 
memory. Moreover, whereas some inferences add information, others reduce it (e.g., the generation 
of main points in macroprocessing).

account strengthens the contextually connected nodes of the network and eliminates 
the irrelevant ones. Such theoretical frameworks, however, have never been used to 
account for narrative discourse impairments in neurolinguistics. 
17-1.1.3. The Conceptual Level 
Although more complex, and less used until recently, the multilayered model of dis- 
course processing advanced by Frederiksen, Bracewell, Breuleux, and Renaud (1990) 
appears much more suited for neurolinguistics and its general goals. This model views 
discourse processing as a complex cognitive process operating simultaneously on four 
different levels (linguistic, propositional, semantic, and conceptual), while stressing 
the importance of the latter level. This conceptual level (which corresponds more or 
less to the "situation model" in van Dijk and Kintsch 1983) is a mental representation, 
or model, of the reality referred to by the discourse that maps only partially onto the 
textual representation itself. Taking the linguistic, propositional, and semantic levels 
as a starting point, the conceptual level includes information from long-term memory 
(inferences using general and specific knowledge of the reader) and from discourse 
context. Contrary to scripts, it is constructed incrementally and revised as the story 
unfolds; as such it constitutes the interpretative context for the rest of the discourse. 
17-1.2. Aspects of Conversational Discourse 
Conversation is the most widely used form of interindividual communication and 
represents the main source of communicative handicap situations for brain-damaged 
patients. Conversation can be defined as a goal-directed alternating cooperative inter- 
action between two, or more, interlocutors sharing a spatiotemporal context. In ex- 
amining conversational discourse, it clearly appears that one cannot express or un- 
derstand discourse without relying on its context. However, despite many research 
studies (e.g., Levinson, 1983), the lack of availability of a conversational frame per 
se as well as the absence of a detailed theoretical model have so far limited neurolin- 
guistic studies to individual aspects of conversation. In this section, three pragmatic 
aspects of conversational discourse are briefly reminded--Grice's cooperative princi- 
ple, the dialogic importance of the addressee, and the role of coherence in topic 
managementmbefore presenting more applied aspects, namely, turn taking and an 
example of a request sequence. 
17-1.2.1. Some Pragmatic Aspects 
Conversation is, by nature, cooperative. According to Grice (1975, 1978), individuals 
observe a general cooperative principle, based on the four maxims of Quantity, Qual- 
ity, Relation, and Manner. These maxims request the speaker to provide a contribution 
that contains the right amount of information, that is true, that is relevant to the 

266 
Yves Chantraine et al. 
conversation, and that is perspicuous. 3 Actually, people communicate much more than 
they literally say, since part of the meaning of their utterances is implied and has to 
be inferred by the listener through conversational implicature requiring inference. In 
fact, the speaker is not even forced to observe Grice's maxims. Relying on the ad- 
dressee's cooperativeness and inferential abilities, the speaker can decide to deliber- 
ately flout any one of them, and yet convey a meaningful statement. Irony, for in- 
stance, relies greatly on the violation of the Quality maxim ("Try to make a true 
contribution") such as in "The meal with Edgar was a complete success" when the 
speaker actually intends to convey that this meal was a total disaster. 
The addressee is another key piece of conversational context; while in narrative 
discourse the listener could be considered a passive partner, in conversation, the in- 
terlocutor is de facto active. The speaker has to consider what s/he believes to be the 
addressee's knowledge, just as the addressee has to rely on the context and on his/her 
beliefs about the speaker's knowledge in order to interpret discourse. This is made 
easier because, besides general world knowledge, interlocutors mutually share some 
degree of common knowledge, beliefs, and suppositions (Clark, 1985). The assessment 
of this common knowledge relies on three kinds of evidence: linguistic (what the 
interlocutors have said previously), perceptual (what happened in the conversation) 
and community membership (what is known, believed, supposed in the various com- 
munities to which the interlocutors both belong). Relevant utterances are then inte- 
grated by the interlocutors in their mental model of the ongoing conversation and 
increase their common ground. 
The local coherence and global plausibility of these relevant utterances are of prime 
importance for topic management (e.g., opening, developing, closing). According to 
Charolles (1986), coherence is based on four main rules: overlap of elements (to avoid 
absence of link), thematic progression (to avoid redundancy), logical noncontradiction, 
and pragmatic relevance to the discourse context. The speaker is forced to manage 
the topic and this avoids, for instance, abrupt topic changes. If the speaker wants to 
shift to a new topic, s/he is expected to explicitly inform the addressee of his/her will 
and to connect the new topic with the current topic (Crow, 1983). 
17-1.2.2. Elements of Conversational Analysis 
The most salient structural feature of conversations is probably its turn-taking organ- 
ization, which was described as a locally managed system by Sacks, Schegloff, and 
Jefferson (1974). Usually, one person talks at a given time, and overlaps between 
interlocutors, though common, are brief. A speaker can either "select" the next 
speaker (e.g., by asking a question), or the conversational partner "selects" himself 
or herself by picking up a turn at an appropriate conversational signal. Turn taking 
often occurs at the end of the current speaker's turn (at "relevant transition place"), 
3These conversational maxims have been discussed at length, notably with the principle of 
politeness advanced by Leech (1983) or the more radical reworking proposed by Sperber and Wilson 
(1986). 

17 
Impairments at the Discourse Level 
267 
which can be difficult to detect, thus causing overlap. Generally, however, interlocu- 
tors' cooperativeness ensures smooth turn transitions. 
Another conversational feature is that turns often come in pairs where one utterance 
depends on the form and the content of the other; examples of such adjacency pairs 
are greetings-greetings, question-answer, offer-acceptance (or refusal), and so forth. 
The structure of a conversational encounter such as, for example, opening and closing 
sequences, or the main ("business") part of a conversation as well as repair sequences, 
are other aspects that have been investigated (see Levinson, 1983 for a review). The 
type of utterances produced by a speaker (for example, speech acts, such as requests 
or apologies) and the influence particular contextual variables have on the way such 
speech acts are interpreted, has been another area of investigation. Requests are con- 
sidered speech acts that initiate a turn. Requests have commonly been characterized 
as being "direct" or "indirect" depending on how "direct" the intention of the 
speaker is expressed. Some authors have ranked requests on a continuum of directness 
with direct requests at one end ("Open the door"), followed by conventionally indirect 
ones ("Can you open the door?") and nonconventionally indirect requests at the other 
end ("It's cold in here"). Whether an utterance is formulated as a "direct," "con- 
ventionally indirect," or "nonconventionally indirect" request depends on several con- 
textual factors such as the "cost" of the request for the addressee, the likelihood and 
the right of the addressee to comply with the request, the social power of the addressee, 
and the familiarity between the interlocutors (for a review, see Stemmer, 1994). When 
the situational context requires a request to be formulated in an indirect form, the 
request is often framed by opening and/or supporting moves to form a whole request 
sequence. 
17-2. DISCOURSE 
IMPAIRMENTS 
IN BRAIN-DAMAGED 
INDIVIDUALS 
Different aspects of discourse-level components can be impaired in patients with ac- 
quired brain damage. 4 Even though deficits of discourse and/or conversational abilities 
are somewhat typical of the verbal communication impairments that can be seen in 
patients with focal right hemisphere damage or in those suffering from dementia (e.g., 
dementia of the Alzheimer type), they are also frequent among aphasic individuals 
having suffered a left-hemisphere insult. However, discourse impairments are not usu- 
ally recognized as aphasic mostly because these abilities were not systematically ex- 
amined when the classical description of aphasias was introduced more than one hun- 
dred years ago. The result of this historical bias is that discourse impairments are 
assimilated to aphasic signs inasmuch as the impaired individual has been otherwise 
4Because of space limitations, only aphasic, right hemisphere-impaired and demented individuals 
with discourse disabilities shall be discussed here. For other degenerative dementias (Pick, Parkin- 
son, Huntington), or the effect of closed head injuries on discourse abilities, see the other chapters 
in this volume. 

268 
Yves Chantraine et al. 
diagnosed as aphasic. On the other hand, they are considered as "nonaphasic" when 
they occur in isolation, that is, in the absence of properly linguistic (e.g., phonological, 
syntactical) impairments. Other authors would argue that discourse impairments are 
nonaphasic in nature because they can be the expression of disturbances in nonlin- 
guistic components of cognition (e.g., working memory, executive function). This 
sectorial approach to cognition cannot be defended seriously since, for instance, most 
of what is classically considered core linguistic impairments in aphasia (e.g., agram- 
matism, anomia) also coexpress the malfunctioning of components of cognition non- 
exclusive to language (e.g., working memory impairments in agrammatism, concep- 
tual semantic problems in anomia). Be that as it may, for purely conventional reasons, 
discourse-level impairments among nonaphasic brain-damaged individuals have been 
referred to as verbal communication disorders. 
17-2.1. Discourse Impairments in Aphasia 
Most of the descriptions of discourse impairments in aphasia were formulated with 
reference to narrative discourse, many of them focusing on formal aspects of verbal 
production. Thus, the early description of discourse-level impairments in aphasia fo- 
cused more on the form rather than the semantics of discourse, whereas the current 
trend is in the reverse direction. 
Although presented earlier as obviously limited, narrative abilities among aphasics 
have been frequently described formally. The literature thus contains the following 
observations: 
1. Word ratios among distinct grammatical classes (e.g., verb/noun or adjective/ 
noun ratios) have been shown to be different among various aphasic types. 
For example, the verb/noun ratio is increased among Wernicke's aphasics, 
whereas it is low among Broca's aphasics (Berko-Gleason et al., 1980). 
2. Sentences are syntactically less rich in terms of length, complexity, and 
correctness (Ulatowska, North, & Macaluso-Haynes, 1981). 
3. Deictics (pronouns and adjectives) are present in larger number, thus 
expressing a more descriptive strategy when asked to produce narratives on 
the basis of pictures (Dressier & P16h, 1988). 
4. Deficits in the referential system are particularly expressed through 
impairments in the processing of anaphors. Thus, anaphoric pronouns are 
frequently introduced without a clear reference (e.g., Cardebat, 1987). In some 
cases, aphasics tend to use general word knowledge in order to compensate 
for the lack of reference (Chapman & Ulatowska, 1989). 
5. A reduction occurs in the number of lexical items used by aphasics in order 
to express the narrative message that would principally affect the story 
episodes that are more marginal within the story structure (Berko-Gleason et 
al., 1980). 
Because of their complexity, theoretical discourse models are underexplored. The 
purpose of most clinical descriptions of narrative abilities remains descriptive and 

17 
Impairments at the Discourse Level 
269 
prosaic and, actually, far from being a test ground of theoretical constructs. For in- 
stance, recently published articles include research on the informativeness of aphasics' 
connected speech (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1992), on the optimal speech sample size 
of connected speech (Brookshire & Nicholas, 1994), or on the informativeness and 
grammaticality of aphasics' narratives of the "Cookie theft" picture (Menn, Rams- 
berger, & Helm-Estabrooks, 1994). 
However, many contributions have looked at the organization of the semantic con- 
tent of narrative, relying partly or totally on a theory-driven approach. These studies 
have shown that aphasic individuals can exhibit impairments in their narrative abilities 
that do not require linguistic processing per se, but rather the contribution of other 
components of cognition to the processing of the content of narratives. Thus, aphasics 
have been shown to present impairments at a purely semantic level based on their 
difficulties in rearranging a set of pictures that could form a coherent story, or to 
choose the appropriate picture in order to end a story coherently (Huber, 1990). How- 
ever, it is impossible to describe in a unitary fashion the possible discourse impair- 
ments in aphasia. In fact, while looking at the coherence violations in the narratives 
of three groups of aphasics (conduction, anomic, and Wernicke's aphasics), Christian- 
sen (1995) has shown that the patterns of violations were qualitatively different for 
the three groups. The first two groups were characterized by discourse impairments 
hypothesized as compensations for their surface-level impairments, while Wernicke's 
aphasics uttered significantly more nonpertinent information, which could signal 
troubles at a deeper level. Among other conclusions, this research stresses the impor- 
tance of carefully distinguishing the subjects' profiles when including them in a group 
study. 
Many of the descriptions of narrative impairments in aphasia have been made by 
reference to the micro- versus macrostructural aspects of narrative processing (see the 
section on aspects of narrative discourse). For instance, Ulatowska, Freedman-Stern, 
Doyel, Macaluso-Haynes, and North (1983) have demonstrated that the macrostructure 
of aphasics' narratives was preserved even when the microstructure was impaired. It 
remains to be known, however, if indeed aphasic patients have no macrostructure 
impairments since it is possible that the results obtained by Ulatowska and colleagues 
could indicate that the subjects simply relied on their world knowledge in order to 
come up with the correct macrostructure. In fact, more recently, Ulatowska and Chap- 
man did report disturbances of macrostructure in aphasic individuals (Ulatowska & 
Chapman, 1994). Related to this is the fact that other studies have shown aphasics to 
exhibit preserved script abilities either in the production of procedural discourse (Ula- 
towska, Doyel, Freedman-Stern, Macaluso-Haynes, & North, 1983) or in the process- 
ing of the semantic content of scripts (Armus, Brookshire, & Nicholas, 1989; 
Lojek-Osiejuk, 1996). Such results have been confirmed in studies investigating con- 
versational discourse abilities (Ulatowska, Allard, Rayes, Ford, & Chapman, 1992). 
In still other studies, it has been shown that aphasics' discourse abilities were unaf- 
fected by pragmatic determinants such as the existence of shared knowledge with the 
listener (Brenneise-Sarshad, Nicholas, & Brookshire, 1991; but see Perkins, 1995 for 
contradictory results) or the familiarity of the listener (Fergusson, 1994). 

270 
Yves Chantraine et al. 
In summary, the analysis of discourse impairments in aphasia tends to show that 
although there can be definite and otherwise recognized impairments at the surface 
level, some aspects of the semantic content appear to be preserved, such as the or- 
ganization of the macrostructure. However, in other cases, evidence suggests that there 
can be some degree of disturbance in the semantics of narratives. The latter raises the 
question of the source of the narrative impairments in aphasia, whether they are prop- 
erly linguistic by nature or the expression of more general cognitive deficits. Regard- 
less of the answer to this question, narrative impairments can genuinely interfere with 
the planning and the implementation of the communicative exchange. The multiplicity 
of cognitive impairments that can result in a semantic impairment of narrative dis- 
course is an indication that some of these impairments are properly neurolinguistic 
while others are not. Again, semantics of narrative discourse is one of many examples 
of the fact that there is no definite border in cognition between properly linguistic 
components and other components of cognition. 
17-2.2. Discourse Impairments among Right Hemisphere-Damaged 
Nonaphasic Individuals 
The analysis of discourse abilities of right hemisphere-damaged (RHD) patients has 
certainly contributed a great deal to the current knowledge about the possible discourse 
deficits that can occur following a brain lesion. 5 The reason for this is that RHD 
patients have a focal, well-delineated lesion but without gross linguistic impairment. 
Thus, sophisticated tasks can be used with these patients in order to truly understand 
the nature of their discourse impairment. Whether these impairments are exclusive to 
RHD individuals still has to be demonstrated. In fact, the same tasks used in RHD 
patients are frequently inapplicable to aphasics. Moreover, even when they are, it is 
possible that the subgroup of RHD patients who do actually show discourse impair- 
ments should be compared to the subgroup of left hemisphere-damaged aphasics who 
simply cannot be studied in the same way due to the importance of the surface lin- 
guistic impairments. 
17-2.2.1. Surface Linguistic Impairment 
Despite the absence of surface linguistic impairment, RHD patients have been shown 
to be impaired in their ability to adequately produce the information contained in a 
narrative (Joanette, Goulet, Ska, & Nespoulous, 1986). In fact, the narratives of RHD 
patients are poorer in informative content despite the absence of lexical or syntactic 
deficiencies. Another characteristic of RHD individuals' narratives is the abundance 
of confabulations, embellishments, and unnecessary and repetitive details (Hough, 
1990; Sherrat & Penn, 1990). According to Hough (1990), the latter characteristics 
are more frequent among RHD individuals with anterior lesions. In one of the few

Tompkins (1995), and Brownell, Gardner, Prather, and Martino (1995). 

17 
Impairments at the Discourse Level 
271 
studies investigating discourse comprehension in brain-damaged individuals and re- 
lying on the use of a multilayered model of discourse processing, Stemmer and her 
colleagues (Fredericksen & Stemmer, 1993; Stemmer & Joanette, in press) showed 
that the three RHD patients investigated were incapable of making "bridging" 
inferences in a text recall procedure. In contrast to aphasic patients and healthy in- 
dividuals, the RHD patients were not able to reconcile two episodes in a text to 
construct a new mental model. However, despite ongoing efforts, there is currently no 
satisfactory comprehensive account of the narrative discourse impairments in RHD 
individuals. 
17-2.2.2. Individual Differences 
It has to be emphasized, however, that not all RHD individuals demonstrate narrative 
deficits. For example, Joanette et al. (1986) observed that only half of their 42 RHD 
patients did indeed exhibit a narrative deficit. This frequently overlooked aspect of 
the problem is a reminder that communication deficits are not always present among 
RHD patients, just as aphasia is not present in all left hemisphere-damaged individuals. 
Moreover, it is not always the case that the specific narrative cues examined can 
identify those RHD individuals with discourse impairments. For example, Tompkins 
and her colleagues (1992) were unable to capture the objective differences between 
RHD and normal individuals' discourse abilities where there appeared to be definite 
qualitative differences. Furthermore, even when present, the specific cognitive im- 
pairment that could affect discourse-level processing is not the same in all individuals 
(Kennedy, Strand, Burton, & Peterson, 1994), just like different left-hemisphere le- 
sions result in different types of aphasia (Joanette, Goulet, & Daoust, 1991). 
17-2.2.3. Nonliteral Language 
A number of studies have documented discourse-level impairments among RHD pa- 
tients related to the nonliteral interpretation of connected speech such as metaphors, 
sarcasm, humor, or indirect speech acts. These are examples of discourse segments 
that require some reference to the immediate or general context in order to be ade- 
quately understood. For instance, Stemmer, Giroux, and Joanette (1994) refined the 
analysis of RHDs' impairments with the processing of indirect requests. They showed 
that RHD individuals essentially had the most problems with nonconventional indirect 
requests. According to the authors, this impairment could express the presence of 
a conceptual problem when the patient is required to integrate surface and textual 
mental models with a conflicting model based on the situation depicted in the 
scenario. In this context, the observation that RHD individuals tend to accept as plau- 
sible some events or elements of information that are otherwise constrained by the 
communicative context (e.g., Kaplan, Brownell, Jacobs, & Gardner, 1990; Rehak, 
Kaplan, & Gardner, 1992) seems to support the hypothesis that RHD individuals are 
likely to have problems with processing at the level of constructing or modifying 
mental models. 

272 
Yves Chantraine et al. 
17-2.2.4. Presence of an Inferential Deficit? 
One possible interpretation proposed for the observed discourse-level impairments 
among RHD individuals refers to an inferential deficit. The possibility of such a deficit 
among RHD individuals has been discussed by Brownell, Potter, Bihrle, and Gardner 
(1986). However, there does not seem to be strong direct evidence in favor of such a 
deficit. In fact, many, if not most, of the studies that looked at nonliteral language 
processing relied on multiple-choice task procedures that could be interpreted as ex- 
pressing the presence of a plausibility metric efficiency (Gardner, Brownell, Wapner, 
& Michelow, 1983). According to this explanation, RHD patients would rather exhibit 
difficulty rejecting implausible events, that is, events whose probability of occurrence 
according to the context is low. Direct evidence of inferencing deficits among RHD 
patients is still under debate. In fact, a number of studies have clearly shown that 
RHD patients are not impaired either in logical inferencing (i.e., syllogism) or in partly 
semantic knowledge-based inferencing (Joanette et al., 1990). 
In summary, the occurrence of a right-hemisphere lesion, though not the cause of 
an aphasia proper, can lead to discourse ability impairments, either when processing 
incoming information or when producing connected speech. Although they express 
impaired or limited functioning in one or many aspects of cognition, or a reaction to 
cognitive impairments, the exact source of such discourse impairments is largely un- 
clear. Overall, verbal communication among RHD patients is usually normal with 
regard to properly linguistic aspects, but can be impaired with regard to the supraword 
semantics and the ability to process the content of discourse according to the context 
in which it belongs. 
17-2.3. Discourse Impairments among Individuals with Dementia 
Discourse processing in demented patients has mostly been studied by assessing 
their narrative abilities (Ulatowska et al., 1988; Bloom, Obler, De Santi, & Ehrlich, 
1994, Chapters 9-13). Unlike RHD patients, individuals with dementia usually 
show impairments in the formal dimensions of language, such as more or less dis- 
crete phonological or syntactic impairments. However, these impairments are much 
less pronounced than those found in aphasia, at least in the earliest stages of the 
disease. 
At the interface between narrative form and content, demented patients have been 
shown to exhibit impairments with the processing of anaphors. Furthermore, narratives 
have been shown to lack cohesion, whether they express the intrusion of paragnosias 
(when narratives are presented with a visual support), the presence of semantic par- 
aphasias, or the expression of a genuine cohesion impairment (Chenery & Murdoch, 
1994). In general, impairments at the level of the semantic structure of narratives in 
dementia tend to parallel impairments of other components of language (e.g., naming, 
writing to dictation, reading; Tomoeda & Bayles, 1993). 
However, the most important difference between narratives and conversations of 
demented patients compared to that of other brain-damaged individuals is the fact that 

17 
Impairments at the Discourse Level 
273 
the macrostructure can also be impaired. Specifically, crucial components of a nar- 
rative are simply omitted, or components from other narratives emerge and become a 
source of intrusion in a given narrative. In many cases, these intrusions can also 
correspond to tangential speech motivated by the patient's personal story. These im- 
pairments at the macrostructural levels are not only observed in narratives. They have 
been shown to be present in tasks requiring script production (Grafman et al., 1991) 
and also in the spontaneous discourse of demented patients (Blanken, Dittmann, Haas, 
& Wallesch, 1987). 
Macrostructure impairments at a conversational level are evidenced by topic shifts 
and topic maintenance, which are reported as difficult for patients with dementia 
(Garcia & Joanette, 1994; Mentis, Briggs-Whittaker, & Gramigna, 1995). It has been 
shown that a deficit in the ability to maintain a conversational topic had to be com- 
pensated for by the interlocutor, which undoubtedly contributed to the burden of 
exchange with demented patients (Garcia & Joanette, 1994). 
Other aspects of communication abilities have also been found to be impaired. 
Analyzing the evolution of the use of clarification requests in her conversations with 
an Alzheimer patient, Hamilton (1994) noted that, with the passing years, the patient 
used fewer clarification requests, which paralleled a decrease in her explicit references 
to memory problems. At the same time, the patient uttered more potential requests 
for confirmation of information, that is, she seemed to lack implicit information that 
the speaker considered to be common (given) to them; this last aspect was considered 
as an early marker of pragmatic troubles in understanding indirect discourse, where 
much has to be inferred by the addressee (Hamilton, 1994). 
Despite a number of studies addressing the discourse abilities in demented patients, 
the question still remains whether the impairments express a decay within the semantic 
memory content or a progressive impairment in the different cognitive components 
necessary in order to comprehend or produce well-formed and relevant discourse. 
Many more theory-driven efforts will be needed in order to provide satisfying answers 
to such questions. 
17-3. CONCLUSION 
Understanding discourse-level impairments is among the most recent chapters in the 
history of neurolinguistics. Indeed, the interest in the ability to comprehend or produce 
connected speech that is relevant by reference to the immediate as well as the general 
context is less than two decades old. Current knowledge appears to be limited by 
the fact that explicit and implementable theoretical frameworks are only starting to 
be applied. However, when applied, the relevancy of such systematic analyses of 
discourse-level abilities has been demonstrated both for clinical and theoretical pur- 
poses. In the latter case, discourse processing certainly represents an aspect of verbal 
communication that will allow a bridge between more classically language-related 
aspects of cognition and other aspects of cognition that are not exclusive to language 
but nonetheless allow for optimal interpersonal communication abilities. 

274 
Yves Chantraine et al. 
Future studies in discourse impairments in brain-damaged individuals will have to 
systematically incorporate an appreciation of all cognitive abilities that are necessary 
in order to achieve normal interpersonal communication (e.g., working and semantic 
memory, attention, inferential abilities, visual skills). It will also become increasingly 
important to propose approaches that will enable capturing inter- and intrasubject 
variability. The application of theoretical models will have to be conducted in a more 
rigourous manner (Kahn, Joanette, Ska, & Goulet, 1990). Finally, and most important, 
future discourse studies in neurolinguistics will definitely have to be explicitly inspired 
by available theoretical models. As with other aspects of neurolinguistics, and despite 
the particularly difficult nature of discourse models and their intricate links with cog- 
nition, it is hoped that with reference to a sound theoretical framework, an increasingly 
greater number of bridges will produce a deeper understanding of discourse-level 
impairments.

CHAPTER 18 
Attention as a Psychological Entity 
and Its Effects on Language 
and Communication 
Zohar Eviatar 
Department of Psychology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel 
Recent views of the structure and functions of attention and their relationship to 
our conceptions of language disorders are presented. First, a brief review is pre- 
sented of the methodologies used in the study of attention. In the next section, 
three aspects of recent findings and thoughts about attention are reviewed: the 
structure of the attentional faculty, allocation and movement of attention, and 
what attention is. Findings from both language-impaired and normal populations 
are presented. The final section discusses specific attentional disorders that are 
believed to be involved in both developmental and acquired language disabilities. 
Our view of attention as a psychological entity has undergone quite radical changes 
over the past decade. A large portion of attention research focuses on selective atten- 
tion (Posner, 1995), conceiving of attention as a mechanism that enhances processing 
of certain stimuli while inhibiting processing of others. A somewhat different con- 
ception of attention divides cognitive processes into those that are automatic, and 
therefore do not require attention, and those that are controlled, and have a "cost" in 
terms of mental resources. Allport (1993) has called into question two of the basic 
questions that have guided the investigation of attention: the search for the point at 
which attention impinges on perceptual and higher processes (i.e., early versus late 
selection), and the distinction between automatic and controlled processes. The most

interesting recent conceptualizations of attention have made these issues moot, pro- 
posing connectionist models in which early and late processes interact, and redefining 
the controlled/automatic dichotomy as a continuum. 
There are three main issues around which much of the newer research can be 
organized: (a) conceptualizations of the functions and structure of the attention faculty; 
(b) research into the mechanisms involved in the allocation and movement of attention; 
and (c) attempts to define attentional processes, or, what attention is. Following a brief 
survey of the basic methods used to study attention, recent findings and thoughts 
around each of these foci will be reviewed. In the final section several attentional 
disorders and their implications for language functioning will be described. 
18-1. METHODOLOGY 
There is a wide variety of tools available for the study of attention. Researchers are 
continuing to use classic experimental tasks such as the Stroop task, letter cancellation 
tasks, and visual detection tasks. In addition, dual-task paradigms, which usually pair 
visual attentional detection tasks with auditory language tasks such as phoneme mon- 
itoring or text shadowing (e.g., repeating a taped text as the participant is hearing it), 
are also used with both normal and pathological populations. Performance on the 
detection task alone is compared to performance when it is paired with the language 
task. Changes in performance between these two conditions are interpreted as reflect- 
ing the costs of dividing and allocating attentional resources. 
Covert visual attention is examined with an experimental paradigm developed by 
Posner and his colleagues (the COVAT paradigm; Posner & Raichle, 1994). Partici- 
pants are required to respond manually to targets presented in the right or left visual 
field. The display usually consists of a central fixation point and two squares or circles 
presented 4 to 8 degrees of visual angle laterally. Targets are stars or dots that appear 
in one of the squares. On approximately 80% of the trials, a spatial cue (the bright- 
ening of the contours of one of the squares) indicates where the target will appear (a 
valid cue). On the remaining trials, the spatial cue appears on the other side (an invalid 
cue). In some experiments there are no-cue trials as well. The important dependent 
variable is the response time to valid and to invalid cues. This paradigm has been 
used extensively in the study of visual spatial attention and the relationship between 
executive and modality-specific functions of attention. 
Investigations of auditory attention use directed attention procedures with the di- 
chotic listening task (Mondor, 1994). Two competing auditory stimuli are presented 
simultaneously, one to each ear, and the participant reports what she or he hears in 
both ears, or in one. Dichotic verbal stimuli result in more accurate reports of the 
stimuli presented to the right ear (a right ear advantage [REA]), while nonverbal 
stimuli often result in a left ear advantage (LEA). The general interpretation of these 
ear asymmetries is that they reflect hemispheric specialization for these types of stimuli 
(see Bryden, 1988 for a review). In general, for verbal materials, there seems to be 
an attentional bias toward the right ear, or right hemispace stimuli, even with monaural 

18 
Attention and Language 
277 
stimulation (see Bradshaw & Nettleton, 1988 for a review). When normal subjects are 
asked to pay attention to left ear verbal stimuli, however, the dichotic perceptual 
asymmetry switches, and a LEA is found. Interestingly, Zaidel (1983a) has reported 
that attentional manipulations affected ipsilateral pathway suppression in a split-brain 
subject, suggesting that the effects of attention are in the modulation of the interaction 
of structural elements that result in the perceptual asymmetry. 
Analyses of the performance of brain-damaged patients in the neuropsychological 
tradition of generalization from the damaged to the normal brain are an important 
source of both data and models. Functional brain imaging (e.g., PET and fMRI; see 
Posner & Raichle, 1994, for an excellent explanation of these techniques) during the 
performance of attentional and language tasks has been especially useful in localizing 
attentional functions in the brain. Analyses of both event-related potentials (ERPs) 
and running EEG data have also been used to measure neural activity associated with 
both sensory and cognitive functions in populations with language and attentional 
impairments. 
Finally, many important models of attention utilize computer simulations of atten- 
tional and language functions. These artificial neural-network models are based on 
networks of interconnected processing units. The units are connected to each other in 
specific structures, and are activated or inhibited as a response to input from other 
units. Representations are manifested by patterns of unit activation. These types of 
models have been described extensively (e.g., Rumelhart, McClelland, & the PDP 
Research Group, 1986), and, as will be demonstrated, have provided some of the most 
interesting new conceptualizations of attention as a psychological phenomenon. 
18-2. THE 
STRUCTURE 
AND FUNCTIONS 
OF THE ATTENTION 
FACULTY 
18-2.1. Attentional Functions 
Two influential conceptions of the structure of attention and its relationship to brain 
functioning have arisen in somewhat different contexts. Researchers who rely mainly 
on behavioral assessment batteries of pathological and brain-damaged populations 
have proposed a heuristic factorial structure of attention (e.g., Mirsky, Fantie, & Tat- 
man, 1995). Researchers who work in the context of neuroimaging and other exper- 
imental paradigms have proposed a network of attentional systems (e.g., Posner, 1995; 
Posner & Peterson, 1990). There are both similarities and differences between these 
theoretical structures, based largely on the somewhat different methods and definitions 
used to construct them. 
18-2.1.1. The Factorial Structure of Attention 
Mirsky and his colleagues (Mirsky et al., 1995; Mirsky, Anthony, Duncan, Ahearn, 
& Kellam, 1991) have noted that impaired attention is one of the most common 
behavioral disturbances in pathological populations (e.g., schizophrenia, affective and 

278 
Zohar Eviatar 
anxiety disorders, lead intoxication, petit mal epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, 
AIDS-related dementia). They constructed a battery of tasks whose execution seems 
to depend on attentional abilities and applied them to several populations of subjects. 
The scores on these tests were used to generate a heuristic factorial model of atten- 
tional functions with four factors: The focus-execute function refers to the ability to 
attend and respond selectively; the shift function refers to the ability of patients to 
shift from attending to one aspect of a stimulus to another; the sustain function refers 
to the ability to maintain vigilance; and the encode function is interpreted as the ability 
to register, manipulate, and recall numerical information. Mirsky and his colleagues 
have proposed a brain localization scheme for these factors based on their use of the 
attention battery with various patient populations, on previous case reports, and work 
with monkeys. The focus-execute function is believed to rely on the integrity of the 
inferior parietal, superior temporal, and striate cortexes; the shift function on prefrontal 
cortex; the sustain function is subserved by midbrain structures; and the encode func- 
tion by the hippocampus and amygdala. 
18-2.1.2. Attentional Systems 
Posner and his colleagues (e.g., Posner, 1995; Posner & Peterson, 1990) have proposed 
that there is an attentional system in the brain that is at least somewhat anatomically 
distinct from other specific functional systems, and that this system is composed of a 
network of anatomical areas. This model is based on research with nonhuman primates 
and the use of imaging techniques of human brain functioning within experimental 
paradigms. The model proposes three major attentional functions: orienting, detecting, 
and maintaining an alert state. Orienting to sensory stimuli has been studied largely 
in the visual modality because of its relation to eye movements (see Posner, 1995 for 
review), and is proposed to have three dissociable elements: disengagement from the 
present target (this function is believed to be subserved by areas in the posterior 
parietal lobe), movement of attention (subserved by the area of and around the superior 
colliculus), and engagement of the new target (subserved by the pulvinar nucleus in 
the thalamus). Several studies have shown that these elements are also useful in de- 
scribing orienting to auditory stimuli (Bedard, Massioui, Pillon, & Nandrino, 1993; 
Hugdahl & Nordby, 1994; Mondor, 1994). The detecting function is thought to be an 
executive network that involves awareness, intentional semantic processing, and the 
allocation of attentional resources (Posner, Sandson, Dhawan, & Shulman, 1989; Fu- 
entes, Carmona, Agis, & Catena, 1994). This system has been localized in the anterior 
cingulate gyrus on the basis of metabolic neuroimaging findings (Posner & Raichle, 
1994). Maintaining an alert state increases the speed of action taken toward a target 
that has been detected. The frontal regions of the right hemisphere have been proposed 
to contain the neural substrate for this function. 
As already noted, there are both similarities and differences between these models. 
The focus-execute function in Mirsky et al.'s (1995) model is equivalent to the ori- 
enting function in Posner's model, while the encode function may be seen as including 
both elements of the orienting function and the detecting or executive function in 

18 
Attention and Language 
279 
Posner's model. Mirsky et al.'s shift function is analogous to the functions of the 
detecting or executive attentional network. Both models posit a separate vigilance 
factor. 
In summary, the present consensus in the field is that attention is composed of 
several dissociable factors, or elements, which are subserved by different areas of the 
brain. These areas are anatomically separate from those subserving processing mech- 
anisms specific to the task that the person is performing (reading, talking, etc.). These 
factors include an orienting/focusing element, a detecting/encoding element, a system 
for allocating attention, and a vigilance factor. 
18-2.2. Allocation and Movement of Attention 
18-2.2.1. Movement of Attention and the Eyes 
A number of studies have specifically explored the relationship between attention and 
eye movements, and have used reading as the experimental task (e.g., Inhoff, Pollat- 
sek, 1995; Posner, & Rayner, 1989; Rayner, Sereno, Lesch, & Pollatsek; 1995; Vitu, 
O'Regan, Inhoff, & Topolski, 1995). The general finding is that attention (in terms of 
the ability to extract information) is asymmetrical in the direction of scanning (that 
is, to the right in Latin scripts and to the left in Hebrew; Pollatsek, Bolozky, Well, & 
Rayner, 1981) and is limited to the line of text (i.e., little information is extracted 
from below the line of text; Pollatsek, Raney, Lagasse, & Rayner, 1993). Although it 
has been shown that this asymmetry of attention does not compromise measures of 
left hemisphere specialization for visually lateralized verbal materials (a right visual 
field advantage has been found in Hebrew as well; see Faust, Kravetz, & Babkoff, 
1993, for a review and discussion), several studies (e.g., Eviatar, 1997; Vaid & Singh, 
1989) have suggested that reading scanning habits may affect performance asymme- 
tries for nonlanguage tasks. Eviatar (1995) has suggested that these effects reflect an 
underlying learned attentional bias that skews covert attention to the side from which 
reading usually begins and then proceeds. This interpretation is based in part on the 
occulomotor readiness hypothesis proposed by Rizzolatti and his colleagues (Rizzo- 
latti, Riggio, Dascola, & Umilth, 1987) that posits that both movement of attention 
and saccades are mediated by the same neural circuits. Interestingly, Hoffman and 
Subramaniam (1995) have reported that it is not possible for subjects to move their 
eyes to one location and covertly attend to another location, emphasizing the point 
that visuospatial attention and the mechanism of generation of voluntary saccades are 
intimately connected. 
The hypothesis that reading scanning habits and saccade programming are related 
to attentional mechanisms is supported by several types of data. Many individuals 
with deficits in one area also have deficits in the other. Fischer and his colleagues 
(Fischer, Biscaldi, & Otto, 1993; Fischer & Weber, 1990) have reported that devel- 
opmental dyslexics have erratic eye movements not only when they read, but also 
when they are performing a noncognitive task. In addition, a growing number of 
studies are showing that children with developmental dyslexia and dysphasia differ 

280 
Zohar Eviatar 
from normal controls in their ability to process and produce sequences of both acoustic 
and visual rapidly changing stimuli (Tallal, Galaburda, Llinas, & von Euler, 1993) and 
have suggested that this is related to a general deficit in the controlled, attentional 
aspects of such tasks. Thus, such children may have a deficit in the attentional aspects 
of occulomotor programming that affects their ability to read. On the other hand, 
scanning habits may result in the relative sparing of attentional functions. Speedie et 
al., (1995) compared left and right hemisphere-damaged patients who had read only 
Semitic (e.g., written from right to left) or non-Semitic (left-to-right) languages on a 
line bisection task. Right hemisphere (RH) damage often results in the syndrome of 
unilateral spatial neglect, where patients do not attend to the left side of objects or 
space (Rafal & Robertson, 1995). One of the defining symptoms of unilateral spatial 
neglect is the failure to bisect lines; patients with RH damage tend to put the midpoint 
to the right of the true midpoint. Speedie et al. (1995) report that patients with RH 
damage who had read only right-to-left languages before the age of 15 bisected lines 
closer to the true midline than patients who had read left-to-right languages. There 
were no significant language-related differences in their LH-damaged patients. Thus, 
again, it appears that reading scanning habits may affect the mechanisms (specifically 
RH mechanisms) that subserve the allocation of spatial attention. 
18-2.2.2. Movement of Attention without Eye Movements 
Using the COVAT paradigm, Posner and his colleagues (see Posner, 1995 for a review) 
have identified the elements of visual attentional orienting that are involved in the 
control of covert attention. They have also identified the probable neuroanatomical 
substrates of these elements by showing that patients with different lesions reveal 
deficits selectively in these components of the task. What is of relevance to us is that 
they have shown that the usual invalidity effect (the slowing of responses to targets 
when the invalid cue was in the opposite visual field) disappears when both normal 
individuals and patients with parietal lobe damage (who usually show exaggerated 
invalidity effects in the contralesional field) are performing either a phoneme- 
monitoring task or shadowing a text at the same time. They interpret these results to 
suggest that there is an executive attentional system that controls resource allocation 
for both auditory language functions and visuospatial attention in the left hemisphere, 
and that it is located in the anterior cingulate gyrus. 
This hypothesis is supported by the behavior of several types of populations. Re- 
search with aphasics (mostly with anterior damagemBroca's aphasics) using both the 
COVAT procedure (Petry, Crosson, Gonzalez-Rothi, Bauer, & Schauer, 1994) and 
dual-task paradigms (Tseng, McNeil, & Milenkovic, 1993), together with dual- 
language task procedures with normal subjects (Fuentes et al., 1994), supports the 
hypothesis that there is an attentional allocation system for language in the frontal 
portion of the LH. The most interesting and controversial support comes however, 
from studies testing covert orienting in schizophrenics. Originally, Posner, Early, Rei- 
man, Pardo, and Dhawan (1988) found that with short cue-target intervals (100 ms 

18 
Attention and Language 
281 
SOA) schizophrenics show the same asymmetry in responses to invalid cues as pa- 
tients with left parietal damage (and the aphasics described earlier). However, with 
long SOAs (800 ms) there was no such asymmetry. They concluded that schizophren- 
ics have damage to the LH anterior attentional system. Unfortunately, these findings 
have had a somewhat uneven replication record, with some authors (e.g., Gold et al., 
1992) interpreting the results to support RH deficits in schizophrenia. However, Mar- 
uff, Hay, Malone, and Currie (1995) have replicated Posner et al.'s (1988) findings 
with a very tightly controlled study. They found this short SOA asymmetry only in 
unmedicated or recently medicated patients, not in chronic, long-term medicated pa- 
tients, which suggests that subcortical dopaminergic mechanisms altered by long-term 
neuroleptic medication are involved in the functioning of the anterior attentional sys- 
tem. Converging evidence that attention allocation mechanisms in the LH of 
schizophrenics are deficient is presented by Green, Hugdahl, and Mitchell (1994), who 
show that both hallucinating and nonhallucinating schizophrenics are unable to shift 
attention from one ear to the other in directed attention conditions of a dichotic lis- 
tening task. 
In summary, many studies have explored the relationship between eye movements 
and attention movements, and have supported hypotheses that the neural mechanisms 
involved in eye movements are also involved in the movement of attention. In addi- 
tion, several studies have suggested that lifetime eye movement habits (such as reading 
scanning direction) may affect attentional mechanisms in the right hemisphere 
(Eviatar, 1995; Speedie et al., 1995). It must be noted that Maruff et al. (1995) report 
that although their schizophrenic subjects showed deficits in the allocation of attention, 
and deficits in eye movement measures, there were no correlations between these 
measures in their subject samples. The incompatibility of these two pieces of infor- 
mation may be reduced by the finding that, for visual scanning at least, there are 
independent attentional mechanisms in the two cerebral hemispheres of split-brain 
patients (Luck, Hillyard, Mangun, & Gazzaniga, 1994). Reading scanning habits may 
affect right and left hemisphere mechanisms in different ways. Several routes of in- 
vestigation converge to support the hypothesis that in the anterior portion of the LH 
there is an executive system that is involved in the allocation of attentional resources 
to language functions and to visuospatial functions, and that language functions take 
precedence over visual detection tasks in dual-task conditions. 
18-2.3. What Is Attention? 
It is clear that stimuli that are attended to are processed differently from stimuli that 
are not. Attention modulates signal detectability so that stimuli that are attended to 
are detected more quickly and accurately than those that are not attended to. The 
question is, what is being modulated? Several possibilities have been suggested: At- 
tention can affect the order by which information is read out of the early sensory 
processing stage, such that attended stimuli are processed first and result in higher- 
quality representations for subsequent processing (Hawkinset et al., 1990; Yantis & 
Johnson, 1990); attention can enhance sensory gain from inputs at the attended 

282 
Zohar Eviatar 
location relative to inputs from unattended locations (Hawkins et al., 1990; LaBerge, 
Brown, Carter, Bash, & Hartley, 1991; Giard, Collet, Bouchet, & Pernier, 1994); at- 
tention is an exclusionary mechanism that filters out noise and inhibits the processing 
of inputs from unattended locations (LaBerge et al., 1991; Shui & Pashler, 1995) or 
representations of features (Treisman & Sato, 1990). These mechanisms are not con- 
ceived of as exclusive, and it is probable that all of them contribute to enhanced 
responses to attended stimuli. 
Previous attempts to define attention have utilized the distinction between con- 
trolled and automatic processes. Automatic processes are done quickly, in parallel, 
and do not require attention, while controlled processes are intentional, slower, more 
serial, and therefore require resources (see Allport, 1993 for a review). The automatic/ 
controlled distinction has been especially useful in psycholinguistic models. In models 
of auditory language processing, attention is defined as a controlled process that me- 
diates the inhibition of competing candidates so that the correct word is recognized. 
The major theoretical framework posits that the incoming stream of speech is seg- 
mented in some way (e.g., by syllables; Segui, Dupoux, & Mehler, 1990) and that 
these segments activate a cohort of candidates (e.g., Vroomen & de Gelder, 1995). 
This process of activation is believed to be automatic (i.e., it does not require atten- 
tional resources). The correct candidate is chosen through listener expectations that 
are based on both the semantic (Chiarello, Maxfield, Richards, & Kahan, 1995) and 
the syntactic (Deutsch & Bentin, 1994) context of the utterance, and serve to inhibit 
the "wrong" candidates that have been activated. However, some psycholinguistic 
models of reading have questioned the distinction between automatic and controlled 
processes (e.g., Tabossi & Zardon, 1993). Cohen, Dunbar, and McClelland (1990) 
have suggested that automaticity in word recognition can be seen as a continuous 
variable, with attention as a modulation of processing in specific pathways, both fa- 
cilitating the attended pathway and/or inhibiting processing in unattended pathways. 
Chiarello et al. (1995) have reported findings compatible with this model, supporting 
the idea that word recognition involves numerous parallel interactive processes, and 
that attentional modulation of these processes is possible at all stages. These issues 
are directly addressed by connectionist models of attentional and of language pro- 
cessing (Cohen et al., 1990; Mozer & Behrmann, 1990; Phaf, Van der Heijden, & 
Hudson, 1990). These authors conceive of attention as a modulation of pathway 
strength and an additional source of input to the interconnected processing units that 
affects their activation thresholds. Attention enhances the activation of input features 
within the attended area relative to those outside the attended area. Whether this occurs 
via active inhibition or not is a specific attribute of each model, however; most 
do not specify whether active inhibition is a necessary prerequisite for selectional 
processes. 
18-2.4. Summary 
Attention is a faculty that has different components: orienting, detecting, shifting, and 
maintenance of vigilance. Movement of attention (at least of visual attention) seems 

18 
Attention and Language 
283 
to be related to the mechanisms that subserve eye movements, and specific brain areas 
have been implicated in the allocation of attentional resources between very different 
tasks. Attention enhances processing of the stimuli that are being attended, and may 
be necessary to inhibit the processing of representations that have been activated but 
are not relevant to the task that the individual is performing. The next section con- 
centrates on attentional and language disorders and summarizes our conceptions of 
their interactions. 
18-3. LANGUAGE 
AND ATTENTIONAL 
DISORDERS 
18-3.1. The Frontal Lobes: Attention, the Executive System, 
and Language 
The frontal lobes compose between a quarter and a third of the human cerebral cortex 
and are the most readily distinguishable difference between the primate brain and that 
of other mammals. Damage to the frontal lobes results in a variety of symptoms that 
have generally been classified as deficits in the executive control functions or super- 
visory system. As mentioned earlier, the anterior attentional system proposed by Pos- 
ner and his colleagues is believed to be subserved by the frontal portion of the cin- 
gulate gyrus. As many frontal lesions result in aphasic symptoms, researchers have 
looked at the relationship between executive and language functions. In general, the 
finding has been that executive dysfunctions are separate from language dysfunc- 
tions. Glosser and Goodglass (1990) found that aphasics with or without lesions ex- 
tending to the dorsolateral regions of the left frontal lobe do not differ in language 
tasks, but the former are more impaired on tests of executive control. Awh, Smith, 
and Jonides (1995) found deficits in verbal working memory with left frontal dam- 
age and in spatial working memory with right frontal damage. Patients with right 
frontal damage are usually not aphasic, but can display aprosodia and deficits in 
discourse and pragmatic aspects of language (Alexander, Benson, & Stuss, 1989). 
Degeneration of either frontal lobe results in reduced verbal output and finally in 
mutism (dynamic aphasia), without specific deficits in the structural aspects of lan- 
guage (Neary, 1995). Attention is an important factor in executive or supervisory 
functions, and thus seems to affect language behavior indirectly, via these executive 
functions. 
18-3.2. Neglect Dyslexia 
Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder that occurs in the context of uni- 
lateral spatial neglect. It is a syndrome that most often follows damage to the right 
parietal lobe, and can be characterized as a deficit in the allocation of attention to 
the left side of space (Rafal & Robertson, 1995). The major symptom of neglect 
dyslexia is the omission of text on the left side of the page, the line of text, or the 
omission or misreading of the initial letters of single words. Of special relevance is 

284 
Zohar Eviatar 
the phenomenon of extinction~a patient can detect or read a single word in the 
contralesional visual field (usually the left visual field) when it is presented alone, but 
will ignore it if another word is presented in the ipsilateral field. A large number of 
studies have revealed that this left-side extinction is subject to a number of very 
interesting effects: it is sensitive to cueing, so that forcing patients to pay attention to 
the left side (by asking them to report the left word first, for example) reduces left- 
side extinction (Behrmann, Moscovitch, Black, & Mozer, 1990); to lexical status, such 
that nonwords are misread more often than words (Sieroff, Pollatsek, & Posner, 1988), 
and even nonorthographic features of letters (e.g., the color of the ink in which they 
are printed) are reported more reliably from words than from nonwords (Brunn & 
Farah, 1991); and to semantic context (Tegner & Levander, 1993; Ladavas, Paladini, 
& Cubelli, 1993). Misreadings of words often preserve word length and position, such 
that the word BEACH may be read as PEACH or REACH rather than as EACH 
(Caramazza & Hillis, 1990a). 
Behrmann and Mozer and their colleagues (Behrmann, Moscovitch, & Mozer, 
1991; Mozer & Behrmann, 1990) have proposed a connectionist model of neglect 
dyslexia that shows effects of deficits in the allocation of attention on both early and 
late stages of processing. In the model, damage is to bottom-up connections between 
an attentional mechanism and input feature maps, and is graded monotonically from 
left to right, such that it is most severe at the extreme left and least in the right. 
Neglect of the left is not all or none, such that top-down processes are able to use 
poorly activated information from nonselected items. This accounts well for the find- 
ing that words are less vulnerable to extinction than nonwords, and for other effects 
of semantic variables in the neglected visual field. The results of Speedie et al. (1995), 
which show a mitigation of neglect in right-to-left readers, may suggest that lifetime 
reading habits can affect the slope of this gradient. 
18-3.3. Attentional Dyslexia 
The four patients with attentional dyslexia who have been described in the litera- 
ture--EM, and P.T. (Shallice & Warrington, 1977), B.A.L. (Warrington, Cipolotti, & 
McNeil, 1993), and P.R. (Price & Humphreys, 1993)--all present an acquired dyslexia 
without dysgraphia. The defining symptom of attentional dyslexia is the ability of 
patients to read whole words better than to name the letters in a word. Patients can 
name single letters, but not a row of letters; they can read single words, but not a row 
of words. In the two patients described by Shallice and Warrington (1977) and in RR., 
described by Price and Humphreys (1993), this impairment was not restricted to verbal 
stimuli. For example, they were better at naming a single shape or a picture than a 
row of shapes or three pictures presented simultaneously. These deficits cannot be 
attributed to a primary spatial deficit, as all of these patients could point to the letter 
they were attempting to identify and had no deficits in scanning attention in a can- 
cellation task. Both Shallice (1988) and Price and Humphreys (1993) suggest that the 
deficit in these cases resides in the setting of the appropriate focus or size of the 
selective attentional window, which allows output from perceptual analysis of stimuli 

18 
Attention and Language 
285 
other than the target to activate higher stages of processing, which results in response 
interference. 
Warrington et al. (1993) report that B.A.L. has trouble only with verbal stimuli 
and not with pictures. They suggest that, in this patient, the locus of the attentional 
deficit lies after a stage at which letters or words have been accessed as units, at the 
stage of transmission of information from a visual word-form system to a semantic 
or phonological stage of processing. This interpretation converges with psycholin- 
guistic models of visual word recognition in which attention modulates processing at 
all stages (e.g., Monsell, Patterson, Graham, Hughs, & Milroy, 1992; Tabossi & Zar- 
don, 1993). It may be relevant that Chiarello and her colleagues (e.g., Chiarello, 1991) 
have shown that semantic priming occurs on a broader scale in the RH than in the 
LH, suggesting that the LH may have some sort of mechanism to halt spreading 
activation. It may be the functioning of this mechanism on various levels that is 
damaged in attentional dyslexics. 
18-3.4. Alzheimer's Disease 
One of the first nonmemory neuropsychological consequences of Alzheimer's disease 
is a decline in attentional capacities. This decline has been documented in all of the 
attentional functions defined earlier (see Jorm, 1986 for a review). Several studies 
have suggested that certain language deficits seen in patients with dementia of the 
Alzheimer's type (DAT) are the result of specific attentional deficits, not of a deteri- 
oration of linguistic abilities. These suggestions make sense within an interactive/ 
connectionist model of language processes, in which attention is a modulating factor 
on patterns of activation within the language system. Balota and Ferraro (1993, 1996) 
have suggested that mildly demented Alzheimer's patients are deficient in their ability 
to inhibit partially activated information, which causes the mispronunciation of ex- 
ception words during reading and large priming and inhibitory effects in lexical de- 
cision tasks. Neils, Roeltgen, and Greer (1995) have shown that deficits in measures 
of selective attention and vigilance predict the degree of characteristic spelling errors 
made by DAT patients to a greater degree than a measure of language ability. Waters, 
Caplan, and Rochon (1995) have shown that lowered performance on a sentence 
comprehension task in DAT patients is the result of inefficient executive control and 
allocation of attention to the propositional structure of sentences, and not of a deficit 
in syntactic processing. It will be interesting to follow the theoretical utility of con- 
nectionist models of language processing that interact with an attentional faculty in 
the elucidation of language breakdown in these patients. 
18-3.5. Attention Deficit Disorders 
A large area of research focuses on attention deficit disorders (ADD), which are di- 
agnosed in (usually) school-aged children. Such children exhibit lowered, or age- 
inappropriate, levels of attention, heightened impulsivity, and overactivity, together 
with poor modulation and self-regulatory behavior. Unfortunately, the majority of the 

286 
Zohar Eviatar 
research in this area is not typically done within the supporting structures of an at- 
tentional theory or model, and the final results of such projects often end up as or- 
phaned lists of empirical findings from which it is hard to generalize. 
Recent research (e.g., Elbert, 1993; Goodyear & Hynd, 1992) has focused on dif- 
ferentiating clinically distinct subclasses among children with ADD, specifically, those 
who have a co-occurring motor hyperactivity (ADD+H) and those who do not (ADD- 
H). Many authors have noted that there is a high co-morbidity of ADD with learning 
disabilities, specifically with reading and writing abilities (e.g., Ackerman, Dykman, 
Oglesby, & Newton, 1994; Elbert, 1993; Whyte, 1994). However, the relationship and 
directionality between these disorders are not clear. Studies looking at the reading and 
writing ability of children with ADD reveal that these skills are below normal (Elbert, 
1993), while studies looking at children with dyslexia reveal that many of them have 
attentional disorders (Ackerman et al., 1994; Whyte, 1994). On the other hand, many 
studies using the directed attention manipulations in the dichotic listening paradigm 
find, in fact, that reading-disabled children are able to raise the performance of the 
left ear when attending to it even more than normally reading controls (see Morton, 
1994 for a review). Morton (1994) has shown that the ability to direct attention in the 
dichotic listening task can interact with a subtype of dyslexia and specific character- 
istics of the stimuli. In these studies, the authors either specifically chose non-ADD 
subjects, or did not categorize their subjects by behavioral attentional criteria. Thus, 
further research in both areas, developmental dyslexia and ADD, is needed to clarify 
the relationship between them. 
Measurement and interpretation of event-related potentials (ERPs) have provided 
a useful tool to measure neural activity associated with both sensory and cognitive 
processes in these subject populations. The component known as P300 has been in- 
terpreted as an index of amount and allocation of attentional resources. Duncan et al., 
(1994) measured both auditory and visual ERPs from a group of adult developmental 
dyslexics and normally reading controls. They report that abnormally small P300 
components appeared only in a visual task, and only in the subgroup of dyslexics that 
had also suffered from ADD+H in childhood. The dyslexics who had not, revealed 
brain potentials that were indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. Inter- 
estingly, the two subgroups of dyslexics were not distinguishable on the behavioral 
measures. These authors also found a hemispheric asymmetry in the P300 component, 
where both normal subjects and non-ADD dyslexics revealed higher amplitudes 
above the right hemisphere (RH), whereas the ADD+ H dyslexics revealed an opposite 
pattern. 
The ERP data, together with the hypothesis that RH parietal areas are involved in 
reading, implicate the RH in disorders of reading and attention. A large amount of 
evidence points to the centrality of the RH in the control of visual attention (e.g., 
Hellige, 1993a). RH-damaged patients also have difficulties with the pragmatic aspects 
of language: understanding metaphors and humor, and in the use of contextual cues 
to interpret conversations (Brownell, Carroll, Rehak, & Wingfield, 1992). Several 
groups of researchers have investigated cognitive and social behavior of children with 
Developmental Right Hemisphere Syndrome (Gross-Tsur, Shalev, Manor, & Amir, 

18 
Attention and Language 
287 
1995; Voeller & Heilman, 1988). These are children who present with neurological 
signs that suggest a deficit in the functioning of the RH. In these studies, together 
with paralinguistic deficits, almost all of the children were diagnosed with ADD. 
However, Branch, Cohen, and Hynd (1995) report that behavior rating scale scores 
and the frequency of diagnosis of ADD+H are not different among children believed 
to have left or right hemisphere damage. As with the epidemiological data already 
described, these findings are suggestive of possible relationships between reading as 
a visual attentional task and the specialization of the right hemisphere for spatial 
attention. However, there is a need for a stronger empirical and theoretical basis for 
such hypotheses. 
18-4. CONCLUSION 
The goal of this chapter has been to summarize developments in the investigation of 
attention, and to show how these are influencing our thinking about the relationship 
between the attention and language faculties of the mind. We have seen that there is 
reason to believe that an executive attentional system that is particularly involved in 
language processes, and also in allocating attentional resources in general, is subserved 
by neural mechanisms in the anterior left hemisphere. There is also a visuospatial 
attentional system that is subserved by the posterior parietal area in the right hemi- 
sphere, which may be involved in the visual aspects of reading. In addition, the mech- 
anisms involved in attentional movement seem to be also involved in eye movement. 
In general, recent conceptualizations of attention represent it as a modulating factor 
within connectionist models of cognitive processes, and of language processes in par- 
ticular. Developments that use these types of theoretical frameworks are now begin- 
ning to yield new and interesting ways of looking at language disorders.

CHAPTER 19 
The Role of Working Memory 
in Language and 
Communication Disorders 
Martial Van der Linden and Martine Poncelet 
Neuropsychology Unit, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium 
This chapter examines the neuropsychological evidence relating working mem- 
ory, and more specifically the phonological loop and the central executive, to 
some aspects of language processing: sentence comprehension, speech production, 
and vocabulary acquisition. It is argued that some aspects of Baddeley's (1986) 
working memory model need to be elaborated in order to accommodate some 
empirical findings, in particular the effect of semantic information on short-term 
memory performance. In addition, a more precise specification of the central 
executive system is clearly required. 
Working memory refers to a limited capacity system that is responsible for the tem- 
porary storage and processing of information while cognitive tasks are performed. 
Baddeley's model represents the most extensively investigated and the best-articulated 
theoretical account of working memory (Baddeley, 1986). This model is composed 
of a modality-free controlling central executive that is aided by a number of subsidiary 
slave systems ensuring temporary maintenance of information. Two such systems have 
been more deeply explored: the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. The 
phonological loop system is specialized in storing verbal material and is composed of 
two subsystems: a phonological store and an articulatory rehearsal process. The pho- 
nological store receives directly and unvoidably any information auditorily presented

and stores it in terms of a sound-based code. Although material in this store is subject 
to decay and interference, it can be maintained and reinforced through the articulatory 
rehearsal mechanism. The phonological store is also able to receive visually presented 
items but these must first be converted into an articulatory form before gaining access 
to the store. These items are conveyed to the store by the articulatory rehearsal process. 
The visuospatial sketchpad system is assumed to be involved in setting up and main- 
taining visuospatial images. According to Logie (1995), the visuospatial system con- 
sists of a visual temporary store that is subject to decay and to interference from new 
incoming information and a spatial temporary store that can be used to plan movement 
and also to rehearse the contents of the visual store. 
The core of the working memory model is the central executive. The central ex- 
ecutive is assumed to be an attentional control system responsible for strategy selec- 
tion and for control and coordination of the various processes involved in short- 
term storage and more general processing tasks. An important characteristic of this 
system is that its resources are limited and divided into different processing and 
storage functions. Baddeley (1986) has suggested that the Supervisory Attentional 
System (SAS) component of the attentional control of action model proposed by 
Norman and Shallice (1986) might be an adequate approximation of the central ex- 
ecutive system. 
Convincing evidence for the existence of different components included in the 
working memory model comes from the study of brain-damaged patients with specific 
short-term memory impairments (for a review, see Van der Linden, 1994). Some 
patients had a deficit of auditory short-term memory that was attributed to a selective 
impairment of the phonological loop (e.g., Vallar & Baddeley, 1984). Other patients 
had a specific impairment of the visuospatial sketchpad (Hanley, Young, & Pearson, 
1991) or of the central executive (Van der Linden, Coyette, & Seron, 1992; Baddeley, 
Logie, Bressi, Della Sala, & Spinnler, 1986). 
Numerous findings from experimental, neuropsychological, and developmental 
sources suggest that working memory makes significant contributions to different do- 
mains of cognition, such as reading, auditory comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, 
counting and mental arithmetic, reasoning, problem solving, and planning (see Logie, 
1993). The aim of this chapter is to examine the neuropsychological evidence relating 
working memory, and more specifically the phonological loop and the central exec- 
utive, to some aspects of language processing, namely, sentence comprehension, 
speech production, and vocabulary acquisition. 
19-1. WORKING 
MEMORY 
AND 
SENTENCE 
COMPREHENSION 
A great number of studies have investigated whether a deficit selectively affecting the 
working memory system might be the source of language comprehension difficulties. 
In particular, there has been a great deal of interest in the consequences of a phono- 
logical loop dysfunction for sentence processing. 

19 
Working Memory and Language 
291 
19-1.1. Phonological Loop and Sentence Comprehension Deficits 
Patients with a defective phonological loop typically show very poor performance in 
immediate recall of all strings of unconnected auditory-verbal materials (digits, letters, 
words). Some patients have been reported to show short-term memory (STM) deficits 
consistent with a disruption of the phonological store (e.g., Vallar & Baddeley, 1984), 
while other patients have been identified to appear to show a deficit in rehearsal (e.g., 
Belleville, Peretz, & Arguin, 1992). In addition, several findings (e.g., Waters & Ca- 
plan, 1995) show that the rehearsal deficit observed in some patients occurs at the 
level of phonological output planning processes that operate on accessed lexical pho- 
nological forms. 
There exists a lot of evidence suggesting connections between severe phonological 
loop impairments and language comprehension deficits. The existence of relationships 
between both types of impairment is particularly supported by a follow-up study of a 
patient, T.B., who showed a parallel recovery on digit span tasks and sentence com- 
prehension tasks (Wilson & Baddeley, 1993). However, the precise role of the pho- 
nological loop in language comprehension remains controversial and a subject of de- 
bate. In fact, two main classes of interpretations have been proposed. 
19-1.1.1. The Phonological Short-Term Memory as a Support 
to First-Pass Language Processing 
One view suggests that phonological storage is necessary to support the first-pass 
language processing, in which the subject carries out the initial syntactic analysis of 
the sentence. However, a phonological representation of an incoming message should 
be consulted only when the correct syntactic interpretation of a sentence is particularly 
difficult to achieve (e.g., Saffran & Marin, 1975). For example, using a sentence 
repetition task, Saffran and Marin (1975) found that I.L., a patient with impaired 
memory spans, could frequently paraphrase (and thus understand) sentences that she 
could not correctly repeat verbatim. However, her productions were often semantically 
incorrect when the sentences to be repeated were either passive constructions such as 
"The boy was kissed by the girl" or center-embedded sentences such as "The man 
the boy hit carried the box." I.L.'s errors frequently revealed an incorrect syntactic 
interpretation that seemed to be dependent on the use of a simple pragmatic strategy 
in which syntactic relations between elements were assigned in a simple Subject-Verb- 
Object sequence. Other studies also reported that patients with severe STM deficits 
showed comprehension difficulties when the sentences are lengthy (Baddeley, Vallar, 
& Wilson, 1987), are semantically reversible (Caramazza, Berndt, Basili, & Koller, 
1981), and contain many content words (Martin & Feher, 1990). On the other hand, 
numerous findings indicated that patients whith STM problems showed normal per- 
formance for short sentences and sentences containing simple syntactic constructions 
(see Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). 
In a similar theoretical context, Vallar and Baddeley (1987) suggest that the pho- 
nological store functions as a "mnemonic window," which preserves word order by 

292 
Martial Van der Linden and Martine Poncelet 
a verbatim phonological record. Accordingly, patients with phonological STM deficit 
should experience sentence processing difficulties restricted to sentences where word 
order is critical. The authors showed that P.V., a patient with a severe phonological 
store deficit, performed well on short sentences with a wide range of syntactic con- 
structions and had no problem with semantically reversible constructions. However, 
in a sentence verification task, she failed to reject false sentences when they were 
constructed by reversing two relevant items from true sentences (e.g., "The world 
divides the equator into two hemispheres, the northern and the southern"). On the 
other hand, P.V.'s scores were better when shortened versions of the complex sentences 
containing word reversals were presented. 
19-1.1.2. The Phonological Short-Term Memory as a Support 
to Second-Pass Language Processing 
The other view concerning the role of the phonological STM in sentence comprehen- 
sion suggests that phonological storage is used in second-pass analysis after syntactic 
analysis has been conducted, but before the sentence structure has been fully inter- 
preted. For example, according to Caplan and Waters (1990), misanalyzing sentences 
such as "The boat floated down the river sank" reflects the operation of first-pass 
processing. Recovery from such a "garden path" (a sentence that produces temporary 
syntactic ambiguity in the course of parsing) is a second-pass processing that involves 
reconsideration of the structure already assigned and this requires the consultation of 
the phonological representation of the sentence. In the same vein, Waters, Caplan, and 
Hildebrandt (1991) suggest that the phonological storage is necessary for a postsyn- 
tactic check of the assignment of nouns to their thematic role. They described a patient, 
B.O., who showed a deficit of the articulatory rehearsal process and possibly of the 
phonological store. She showed excellent comprehension of a wide variety of syntactic 
structures, indicating that articulatory rehearsal is not needed for assignment of syn- 
tactic structure and thematic roles. By contrast, she had a particular difficulty in pro- 
cessing sentences containing three proper nouns such as "Patrick said that Joe hit 
Eddy," while she had no problem with sentences that used animal names in the place 
of proper nouns. It was argued that this pattern of performance indicates a role for 
phonological STM at a postsyntactic stage of sentence comprehension, in which the 
assignment of nouns to their thematic roles is checked. 
This "second-pass" interpretation is also supported by the performance of two 
patients, R.A.N. and N.H.A., reported by McCarthy and Warrington (1990a). These 
patients with poor STM performance showed difficulties in comprehension when they 
had to deal with large amounts of condensed (and relatively arbitrary) information in 
a relatively brief message (such as Token Test instructions, for example, "Before 
picking up the green circle, touch the red square"; De Renzi & Vignolo, 1962), when 
sentences broke conventional conversational rules, and when an understanding of the 
sentence required supplementary cognitive operations to be performed on the spoken 
input (for example, simple comparative judgments such as "What is green, a poppy, 
or a lettuce?"). 

19 
Working Memory and Language 
293 
On the other hand, Caplan and Waters (1990) reinterpreted the performance of RV., 
the patient reported by Vallar and Baddeley (1987), in terms of a deficit in second- 
pass language processing. According to Caplan and Waters, RV.'s difficulty in pro- 
cessing sentences such as "The world divides the equator into two hemispheres, the 
northern and the southern" may lie at the stage of processing in which the patient 
must choose between the syntactically and lexicopragmatically derived meanings of 
the sentence. 
However, some data do not support Caplan and Waters's (1990) hypothesis. For 
example, Martin (1993) observed that patients with phonological short-term memory 
deficits showed good comprehension of garden-path sentences. 
In conclusion, it appears that patients with impaired phonological STM do not 
necessarily share the same comprehension difficulties with the same types of struc- 
tures. This might suggest that the phonological loop does not actually play a role in 
sentence comprehension. Indeed, the existence of an association between poor im- 
mediate retention of verbal material and sentence comprehension deficits is not suf- 
ficient to state that phonological storage is involved in language comprehension. Such 
an association might arise simply from the anatomical proximity of the neural struc- 
tures involved in both types of activity. In that perspective, Butterworth, Campbell, 
and Howard (1986) reported the case of R.E., who showed a developmental deficit 
of the phonological STM. She was tested on a wide range of tasks requiring syntactic 
analysis, memory, and comprehension of long and complex material. Despite her 
phonological STM deficit, she showed no deficit in sentence comprehension. Butter- 
worth et al. (1986) argued that, as a phonological STM impairment did not automat- 
ically produce deficits in comprehension, it was not critically involved in sentence 
comprehension. However, some authors (Vallar & Baddeley, 1989) questioned the 
sensitivity of the comprehension tests administered to R.E. It was also suggested that 
R.E. might have developed highly atypical strategies for language comprehension as 
a consequence of a lack of STM capacity. 
It could also be argued that the heterogeneity of STM patients' performance in 
sentence comprehension is, at least partly, the result of differences in the severity or 
nature of the phonological loop disorders. In fact, most STM patients who were ex- 
plored had a deficit affecting the phonological store. However, the specific nature and 
severity of their phonological store deficit might differ. Finally, this heterogeneity 
might also indicate that factors other than phonological memory capacity intervene in 
the relationships between STM and comprehension deficits. 
19-1.1.3. Involvement of Semantic and Syntactic Short-Term Memory 
Components in Sentence Comprehension 
Most researchers who attempted to explore the performance of patients with reduced 
verbal memory span in sentence comprehension assume that memory span is depend- 
ent on the phonological loop component. However, some evidence has suggested that 
lexical and semantic storage also plays a role in span performance (e.g., Howard, 
1995). Thus, it appears that memory span is a complex phenomenon drawing on 

294 
Martial Van der Linden and Martine Poncelet 
different levels of representations. In that perspective, Martin, Shelton, and Yaffee 
(1994) explored the short-term abilities and sentence comprehension in two brain- 
damaged patients (A.B. and E.A.). Although both patients showed similar span re- 
duction, one patient (A.B.) showed better performance on span tasks for phonological 
than for semantic information, while the other patient (E.A.) showed the reverse. For 
example, Martin et al. compared both patients on immediate recall for words and 
nonwords. Typically, normal subjects perform better on words than nonwords (Hulme, 
Maugham, & Brown, 1991), presumably because word retention depends on both 
phonological and semantic information, whereas nonword retention mainly depends 
on phonological information. Moreover, the authors used a task in which word lists 
were presented auditorily and patients were asked to judge either whether a probe 
word rhymed with one of the words in the memory list or whether the probe word 
was in the same category as one of the memory list items. The probe rhyming task 
required retention of phonological information while the probe category task required 
retention of lexical-semantic information. In lists recall, E.A. showed a superiority for 
words over nonwords whereas A.B. showed little advantage for words. In addition, 
A.B. performed better than E.A. on the probe rhyming task, that is, when retention 
of phonological information was required, whereas E.A. performed better on the 
category probe task, that is, when retention of semantic information was required. 
These results suggest that E.A.'s STM deficit affected mainly the retention of pho- 
nological information whereas A.B.'s affected mainly the retention of lexical- 
semantic information. On the other hand, the performance of both patients on the 
sentence-processing tasks was consistent with these contrasting STM deficits. On sen- 
tence repetition, the patient with the phonological retention deficit (E.A.) was more 
impaired than the patient with the semantic retention deficit (A.B.), whereas on sen- 
tence comprehension, the patient with the semantic retention deficit (A.B.) was more 
impaired. In another study, Martin and Romani (1994) described a patient, M.W., who 
showed a difficulty in sentence comprehension that was attributed to a deficit affecting 
specifically the retention of syntactic structures. 
According to Martin and Romani (1994), these results suggest that memory span 
should not be seen as dependent on the operation of a specialized STM store but 
rather as drawing on the operation and storage capacities of a subset of components 
involved in language processing. In other words, the different levels of representation 
involved in memory span and language processing draw on specific resources, which 
may be conceptualized either as buffers specialized for particular types of represen- 
tations, or in terms of rates of decay that may differ for different levels of represen- 
tation. The phonological, semantic, and syntactic components interact and support 
each other and their respective contribution depends on the nature of the task. For 
example, syntactic and lexical-semantic information could be linked to phonological 
information to support verbatim recall, resulting in a larger span for words than for 
nonwords and a larger span for sentences than for word lists. 
This view clearly differs from Baddeley's (1986) working memory conception in 
that it considers that verbal STM is an integral part of the language system, whereas 
for Baddeley, the working memory components are not strictly tied to any particular 

19 
Working Memory and Language 
295 
cognitive system. Furthermore, Martin et al.'s (1994) view postulates the existence of 
specialized storage resources for semantic and syntactic information, in addition to 
the phonological component. Within the framework of Baddeley's model, the tem- 
porary storage of semantic (or even syntactic) information might be plausibly viewed 
as residing in the central executive system or as resulting from a temporary activation 
of long-term memory information (a long-term working memory; Ericsson & Kintsch, 
1995) that is coordinated by the central executive. Such a conception clearly raises 
the question of the central executive system's role in sentence comprehension deficits. 
19-1.2. Central Executive and Language Comprehension 
The work of Daneman and Carpenter (1980) strongly contributed to the view that 
comprehension of language places demands on working memory considered as a lim- 
ited pool of general-purpose resources that can be used to serve both processing and 
storage of information. This conception of working memory appears to correspond 
rather closely to the central executive component in Baddeley's (1986) working mem- 
ory model. 
According to Daneman and Carpenter (1980), limitations on cognitive resources 
can account for many types of individual differences and processing strategies in 
language comprehension (see Carpenter, Miyake, & Just, 1995). Similarly, it could be 
argued that a deficit affecting the central executive system should impair language 
comprehension. However, a major difficulty in the exploration of the relations between 
language deficits and the central executive system is that a wide range of cognitive 
abilities have been ascribed to the executive system: control, processing, and even 
storage activities. Another problem is to find a way to specifically explore the central 
executive system without confounding its function with that of the slave systems. 
Research conducted by Morris (see Morris, 1994) and Baddeley et al. (1986) pro- 
vided some criteria indicating the existence of a specific central executive deficit (see 
also Van der Linden et al., 1992). Patients with an impaired central executive should 
show a mild reduction of span, normal effects of phonological similarity and normal 
length effects on span (indicating the integrity of the phonological store and the ar- 
ticulatory rehearsal process), and impaired performance on dual tasks. 
19-1.2.1. Alzheimer's Disease and Language Comprehension 
On the basis of these criteria, several studies suggest that patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD patients) have impairments of the central executive component of working 
memory (see Morris, 1994). More specifically, it appeared that AD patients showed 
a deficit affecting one important component of the central executive, that is, the ca- 
pacity to coordinate two or more subprocesses (Baddeley et al., 1986). Waters, Caplan, 
and Rochon (1995) explored the relationships between processing capacity and sen- 
tence comprehension in AD patients. Patients were administered a sentence-picture- 
matching task. The to-be-interpreted sentences differed in syntactic complexity and 
number of propositions. Subjects were tested on this task, on the one hand, with no 

296 
Martial Van der Linden and Martine Poncelet 
concurrent task and, on the other hand, while concurrently remembering a digit load 
that was one less than their span or equivalent to their span. The AD patients met 
Morris's (1994) and Baddeley et al.'s (1986) criteria indicating the existence of a 
central executive impairment. The results show an interaction between subject group 
and size of the digit load in the digit recall measurement, which indicates that the 
performance of AD patients was more affected by dual-task conditions than that of 
the controls. This is consistent with the view that AD patients have a reduced capacity 
of the central executive system. However, the patients were not disproportionately 
impaired on the sentence types that were syntactically more complex. The authors 
interpret this absence of dual-task effect in AD patients by postulating the existence 
of different processing resource pools for different types of verbal operations. More 
specifically, they argue that AD patients showed a reduction in central processing 
resources but that this reduction did not affect the availability of resources involved 
in syntactic processing. In addition, the results show that the patients performed more 
poorly on sentences with two propositions than did the controls, and more poorly on 
sentences with two propositions than on sentences with one proposition. The authors 
interpret this disproportionate "proposition" effect by suggesting that the patients have 
a deficit affecting postinterpretative processing (as opposed to assignment of sentence 
meaning itself), and more specifically the cognitive processes involved in matching 
propositional content to a picture. Finally, although the AD patients showed a dec- 
rement in dual-task performance, they did not show a disproportionate decrease of 
performance on two-proposition sentences compared to one-proposition sentences, un- 
der digit load conditions, compared to controls. This pattern of results cannot be 
explained by a reduction of processing resources since such a reduction should have 
led to a three-way interaction between size of digit load, sentence type, and group, 
which was not observed. According to Waters et al. (1995), the results could be 
interpreted by postulating that AD patients have impairments in a control mechanism 
that shifts attention between tasks and this control deficit could lead to a decline in 
performance under dual-task conditions, without this decline being greater for more 
demanding sentences. This study clearly suggests that the investigation of the central 
executive's role in sentence comprehension requires a precise specification of the re- 
source pools and of the resource allocation. Waters et al.'s (1995) study also indicates 
that different aspects of the central executive system may be affected, for example, 
the processing capacity or the control component (flexibility), with different conse- 
quences on performance. 
19-1.2.2. Language Comprehension in Aphasic Patients 
Miyake, Carpenter, and Just (1994) argued that comprehension breakdown in aphasic 
patients may be attributed to a severe reduction of a general-purpose verbal working 
memory system. This proposition was based on results issued from two sentence 
comprehension experiments using rapid serial visual presentation in normal subjects, 
which they consider simulate important features of aphasic patients' comprehension 

19 
Working Memory and Language 
297 
of syntactic structures. However, this view has been challenged by Caplan and Wa- 
ters (1995) and Martin (1995). These authors point out that a theory hypothesizing 
damage to separable components more easily accommodates findings of double dis- 
sociations in aphasic patients' performance on different sentence types, and that Mi- 
yake et al.'s (1994) results may also be accounted for by a theory that assumes sep- 
arable processing resource systems involved in language comprehension and other 
verbal tasks. 
19-1.2.3. Aging and Language Comprehension 
Finally, a large body of research also suggests that language performance differences 
(for example, in the comprehension of and memory for discourse) between young and 
old adults are due to age-associated differences in working memory capacity (see 
Hupet & Nef, 1994). However, other studies indicate that speed of processing and 
inhibitory efficiency might be more fundamental factors than working memory (e.g., 
Kwong See & Ryan, 1995). In this perspective, Hasher, Zacks, and their colleagues 
have conducted a series of studies showing that age differences in the inhibition of 
irrelevant internal thoughts and external stimuli underlie age difference in language 
performance (see Zacks & Hasher, 1994). In fact, they argue that people with ineffi- 
cient inhibitory mechanisms will allow information that is off the goal path to enter 
into working memory. For example, older adults have been found to be less likely 
than young subjects to inhibit initial inferences subsequently made untenable by text 
context. More generally, differential ability to inhibit information has been proposed 
as an alternative to resource theories in interpretations of developmental and indi- 
vidual differences (see Dempster & Brainerd, 1995). Most of these inhibition theo- 
ries seem to consider inhibition as a passive, automatic event. However, recent find- 
ings suggest that inhibition is (at least partly) a product of controlled resources and 
that group differences in inhibition may result from differences in controlled atten- 
tional resources, and not from inefficient inhibitory processes (Engle, Conway, Tu- 
holski, & Shisler, 1995). This view is consistent with the idea of a central executive 
as being a general attentional system, whose function would be the inhibition of ir- 
relevant information as well as activation and maintenance of information relevant 
to the task. 
In summary, there exists some evidence relating central executive dysfunctioning 
to language comprehension deficits. However, the central executive is certainly not a 
unitary system and, as a consequence, it could be damaged in different ways. In that 
perspective, future research should be conducted to explore the comprehension abil- 
ities of patients with different types of central executive disorders. 
Language comprehension certainly is the domain of language activities in which 
the role of working memory has been the most extensively explored from a neuro- 
psychological point of view. In the last part of this chapter, we will examine, more 
briefly, whether neuropsychological data also suggest a contribution of working mem- 
ory to other types of language deficits.

19-2. WORKING MEMORY AND SPEECH 
PRODUCTION 
DEFICITS 
The neuropsychological findings favor the view that the phonological loop is not 
involved in the planning and production of spontaneous speech. Indeed, normal speech 
production has been reported for several patients with acquired STM deficits. For 
example, the patient J.B., described by Shallice and Butterworth (1977) had a severe 
deficit of verbal STM but her speech production abilities were normal: her utterances 
were syntactically well formed and of normal phrase length, her pause duration was 
within the normal range, and the content of her speech was reasonably informative. 
On the other hand, there exists some evidence issued from studies conducted in normal 
subjects suggesting that the central executive could be involved in constructing the 
conceptual content of speech (see Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). At this time, no 
neuropsychological data directly corroborate this hypothesis. 
However, Martin and Romani (1995) reported the case of a patient, Alan, who had 
a very specific deficit in the short-term retention of semantic representations and who 
developed problems in producing (and also in understanding) speech. The patient's 
STM deficit affected only the retention of the meanings of individual words (or 
lexical-semantic representations). In other words, he did have difficulty in keeping 
simultaneously in mind the meanings of several words, whereas he was able to hold 
verbal information in a phonological form. His comprehension abilities were normal 
as long as he was able to integrate word meanings with each other as each word 
was perceived. However, he had particular difficulty in comprehension when he was 
forced to retain individual meanings in STM. On the other hand, his speech pro- 
duction was very poor whenever he tried to produce more than single-word utter- 
ances. For example, he was unable to produce an adjective-noun phrase correctly, 
whereas he was normal at naming individual objects. It was argued that Alan's pro- 
duction deficit derived from an inability to retain several individual word meanings 
simultaneously while the phonological representations for the words are accessed. 
Whether the retention of word meanings depends on a specific storage resource or 
rather on the general-purpose central executive system, it nevertheless remains that 
these data suggest the existence of a relationship between STM and speech produc- 
tion deficits. 
19-3. WORKING MEMORY AND 
VOCABULARY 
ACQUISITION 
In contrast to speech production, neuropsychological studies have provided strong 
evidence suggesting that the phonological loop plays a critical role in vocabulary 
acquisition. Typically, patients with defective phonological STM may have preserved 
performance on standard episodic memory tasks, requiring the acquisition of verbal 
information. However, a study conducted on patient P.V., who had a selective pho- 
nological store deficit, suggests that learning and retention of new words (that is, pro- 

19 
Working Memory and Language 
299 
nounceable letter strings without any preexisting lexical-semantic representations) is 
severely defective (Baddeley, Papagno, & Vallar, 1988). Her verbal long-term learn- 
ing and retention of individual words and connected discourse were normal. Bad- 
deley et al. (1988) explored P.V.'s abilities to learn familiar words and new words 
by means of an auditory paired-associate learning procedure. P.V. was completely 
unable to learn word-nonword pairings (an Italian word and its Russian translation, 
for example, rosa-svieti), whereas her learning of pairs of Italian words was nor- 
mal. Baddeley et al. (1988) concluded that long-term memory of new phonological 
forms requires the integrity of the phonological store. Similar difficulties in acquir- 
ing new words have also been reported by Baddeley (1993a) in a 23-year-old grad- 
uate student, S.R., who showed a developmental deficit of phonological working 
memory. 
The hypothesis that phonological working memory plays a role in vocabulary ac- 
quisition was also supported by a study of Vallar and Papagno (1993) conducted in a 
25-year-old Italian woman affected by Down's syndrome. EE was able to learn three 
languages (Italian, English, and French) in spite of poor general intelligence and de- 
fective visuospatial skills and episodic memory. In addition, EE has an entirely normal 
phonological short-term memory. Finally, contrary to P.V., EE was able to learn word- 
nonword pairs at a normal rate, whereas her learning of word-word pairs was defec- 
tive. Barisnikov, Van der Linden, and Poncelet (1996) obtained similar results with a 
19-year-old woman suffering from Williams syndrome and showing relatively pre- 
served language abilities in spite of a severe visuospatial deficit. These data corrob- 
orate the existence of a link between the phonological loop and vocabulary acquisition 
and also indicate that learning of new vocabulary may occur even in the presence of 
a defective verbal episodic memory. 
Finally, numerous developmental and experimental studies have also contributed 
to verify the neuropsychological indications that the phonological loop is critically 
involved in the acquisition of new vocabulary. In particular, it appears that poor vo- 
cabulary acquisition associated with developmental language disorders may be due to 
deficits of phonological working memory (see Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). 
19-4. CONCLUSION 
A number of neuropsychological studies indicate that a deficit in working memory 
may result in some language impairments, such as sentence comprehension, acquisi- 
tion of vocabulary, or even in speech production. These relationships between working 
memory and language have mainly concerned the phonological loop system and the 
central executive. In fact, the visuospatial sketchpad might also play a role in some 
aspects of language processing, for example, in text comprehension, inasmuch as 
mental imagery might be involved. Other data issued from developmental or experi- 
mental studies have confirmed these neuropsychological indications but have also 
shown that working memory might be implicated in other domains of language pro- 
cessing, such as reading (see Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993).

Baddeley's (1986) working memory model has played an important part in neu- 
ropsychological studies of patients with language impairments. However, it appears 
that some aspects of Baddeley's model need to be elaborated in order to accommodate 
some empirical findings, for example, the effect of semantic information on STM 
performance. In addition, a more precise specification of the central executive system 
is clearly required.

The Influence of Emotions 
on Language and 
Communication Disorders

Language, cognition, and emotion have traditionally been viewed as separate 
elements of mental processing. Although language and emotion differ essentially, 
evidence from normal and disordered linguistic expression suggests that attitu- 
dinal and emotional information is naturally present in speech. Verbal commu- 
nication expresses attitudes and emotion via prosody, syntax, lexicon, and the 
pragmatics of discourse. Emotional and psychiatric disturbances resulting from 
dysfunction of the cerebral hemispheres, limbic system, and the basal ganglia are 
manifest in speech/language function. Disorders of affective communication, pro- 
sodic, syntactic, lexical, and pragmatic disturbances, are associated with brain 
damage at various sites, especially subcortical, bilateral prefrontal, and right 
hemisphere. 
In one view, language, a structural system, has only a tangential relationship to emo- 
tions. Strictly speaking, phonology, syntax, and the semantic lexicon provide tools, 
equally capable of verbalizing about the world, a mathematical theorem, or an emo- 
tion. From this perspective, language and emotions differ intrinsically. In another view, 
language has firm biological roots in emotional expression. Jespersen (1969) specu- 
lated that human language originated in love song. Bolinger (1964) believed that the 
"primitive dance" of human emotional life resides in intonation, the foundation of

speech. The recent field of "pragmatics," the orderly use of language in everyday 
situations, now investigates the role of nonliteral meanings, humor, themes, and in- 
ferences, including inference about attitudes, in language processing. 
There is much evidence to support the second viewuthat emotions, moods, affect, 
and attitudes naturally underlie and inform normal spoken expression. Further, neu- 
rolinguistic studies indicate that disorders of emotional processing result in commu- 
nicative deficits. This chapter provides an overview of the relationship between emo- 
tions and language in normal and disordered language and communication. 
20-1. 
SOME 
DEFINITIONS 
Language and cognition (or thought) require only minimal characterization for the 
purpose of this chapter, as the terms are used fairly consistently by professionals and 
laypersons. The term "language" refers to the speakers' internal knowledge of pho- 
nological, morphological, and syntactic rules with an accompanying lexicon; "speech" 
refers to the external expression of language. "Cognition" refers to mental experience 
of all kinds--processing, memory, attention, concentration, images, planning. For 
many years, cognitive psychology proceeded without mention of emotion or affect 
(see Zajonc, 1960), but recently the importance of emotional matters in thinking has 
been recognized broadly (Damasio, 1994; Goleman, 1995). 
The terms for emotional phenomena are the most resistant to satisfying systema- 
tization. In psychology and psychiatry, emotional states are characterized in terms of 
the patient's "mood" or "affect." Mood generally refers to the patient's internal sub- 
jective feeling state, either in the moment or over time; mood may not be visible to 
the examiner, as outward clues to internal feeling states are often misleading in the 
presence of neurologic or affective disorders. "Affect" may be used to refer to an 
emotional state before it is endowed with awareness; "affect" has been used by others 
to refer to manifestation of emotion, especially facial expression, gesture, and tone of 
voice (Benson, 1984). Some behaviors, such as screaming and tearfulness, may occur 
without a veridical tie to internal mood or emotional state, as seen in pseudobulbar 
emotional states (Ivan & Franco, 1994). In contrast, "unconscious" affect may account 
for speech errors, unintentional puns, choice of words, or tone of voice that does not 
match the words. The "Freudian slip" theory of speech errors (Freud, 1960) has been 
partially overruled by scientific analysis of speech error data, which indicates that 
linguistic-structural factors, rather than unconscious motivation, generally account for 
the errors (Cutler, 1982). We use the terms "emotional behavior" and "affective be- 
havior" for outward manifestations, and "emotional experience" and "affect" to refer 
to inner states, which may or may not be conscious, and may or may not have outward 
signs. In fact, frank emotions emerge from speech much less than the broad range of 
speaker attitude, such as approval, dislike, concern, impatience, and so forth. Attitude 
is more commonly manifested in ordinary talk, but is often neglected in research on 
language and expression.

303 
20-2. HUMAN 
EMOTIONAL 
EXPERIENCE 
Emotional states may be viewed in terms of their bodily manifestations (e.g., a smile) 
or the subjective experience of the emotion (e.g., feeling happy). Of course, emotions 
correspond to patterns of brain activity, and some knowledge of cerebral structures 
and circuits important in emotional experience has been derived from animal lesion 
experiments and from studies of humans with localized brain damage. Physiological 
manifestations of emotional states include changes in the autonomic nervous system 
and the release of neurotransmitters, neuroendocrine secretions, and hormones. Ges- 
turing and changes in posture, facial expression, and voice modulation represent an- 
other set of bodily changes in response to emotional states. Other verbal signs may 
occurmdistinctive word or nonverbal vocal choices, such as swearing, sighing, or 
emitting exclamations that may have begun as a reflexive vocalization but have 
evolved to onomatopoeic words: ow!, Jeez! 
Attempts to categorize various emotional states resulted in a plethora of systems, 
in part because of the difficulty in coming to agreement on definitions, and in part 
because of the number and range of human emotional experiences (Ekman, 1992). In 
1890, William James articulated a theory of emotions that later became known as the 
James-Lange theory of emotions. This theory states that the subjective experience of 
emotion is produced by the awareness of physiological changes in the face of arousing 
stimuli. Thus, when confronted by a snarling dog, we are aware of sweating palms, 
ragged breathing, and a pounding heart; this leads to a subjective feeling of the emo- 
tion of fear. The important relation of body states to feeling states has been revisited 
(Damasio, 1994; Ekman & Davidson, 1993). But since neuroscientists have noted that 
visceral responses to arousing stimuli are often similar, how does one explain the great 
variety and subtle range of human emotional experiences? 
A different theory of emotions, which emphasizes cognitive factors, was offered 
by Schacter and Singer (1962). In their theory, autonomic arousal is shaped into 
specific emotional experience via an attribution process, utilizing circumstances and 
context to a great extent. Both physiological arousal and cognitive mediation play 
important roles in the process of the subjective feeling of emotions and in the sub- 
sequent verbal and nonverbal displays. 
20-3. LANGUAGE, 
THOUGHT, 
AND 
EMOTION--- 
THE 
TRIAD 
Language, emotion, and thought may form autonomous modules in the mind of the 
philosopher, but in reality they are intertwined. Thoughts are ordinarily imbued with 
emotional tone, and language interfaces intimately with cognition and emotion. The 
actual intimacy of cognition and emotion, with emotion often preceding an apparently 
autonomous cognitive process, has been eloquently discussed by Zajonc (1960). Cur- 
rent neurobehavioral opinion has argued persuasively for the interdependence of 

304 
Diana Van Lancker and Nancy A. Pachana 
thought, emotion, and body in that all may be disrupted by damage to one cortical 
area. 
Attempts at attributing structure to any one component of the "triad" have been 
the most successful in the case of language, which is made up of phonemes, mor- 
phemes, words, sentences, discourse, and rules for organizing the smaller units (gram- 
mar or syntax). Structural models in cognition (e.g., information processing, schemata, 
models of memory and attention) have clarity and coherence. Of the triad, emotional 
phenomena have been the least amenable to codification. Linguistic structure has been 
said to access thought through an intermediate level called "mentalese" by Fodor, 
Bever, and Garrett (1974). Some cognitive scientists have avidly debated whether 
"thought" can occur without language, and others have insisted that language feeds 
back onto thought, determining its conceptual categories (Whorf, 1961). In sharp con- 
trast, the question does not arise regarding language and emotion: no one doubts that 
emotion can occur without language. It might be argued that "language" as a struc- 
tural system can occur without the influence of emotion, but actual verbal commu- 
nication seldom does. Whereas language has been recognized as a major partner of 
cognition, by contrast, language and emotion are best described as having an uneasy 
coexistence, being disparate entities as well as coworkers in the business of commu- 
nication. However disparate language and emotion may be, emotional and attitudinal 
nuances tinge all but the most neutrally constructed linguistic expression. 
20-4. DOES 
LANGUAGE 
EXPRESS 
EMOTIONS? 
Language does indeed express emotion both indirectly and directly, implicitly or ex- 
plicitly, using different "levels" of linguistic form: phonetic, lexical, syntactic, se- 
mantic, pragmatic. Sounds and words carry valences, expressing attitudes or emotions 
implicitly, even in the earliest stages of communicative development. For example, a 
range of attitudes and emotions is identifiable in the melodies of mothers' speech to 
their infants (Fernald, 1985). A prime lexical example of implicit emotional infor- 
mation lies in connotative meanings; connotations convey attitudes, adding to the 
referential meaning. The lexical items "slim," "slender, .... skinny," and "scrawny" 
all denote physical thinness, but the first two connote approval, whereas the others 
are derogatory. Osgood (1980) contributed the "semantic differential" to our under- 
standing of how word meanings are mentally stored with emotional significance. A 
salient example of specific choice of verbiage to convey attitudinal and emotional 
meaning is cursing (Jay, 1992). 
The speaker's intentions and attitude are very important components of speech, and 
may be the least studied in neurolinguistics. The term "attitude" in social psychology 
refers to a stable mental position consistently held by a person toward some idea, or 
object, or another person, involving both affect and cognition. In language, word 
choice and intonation convey the attitude of the speaker: irony, incredulity, contempt, 
disdain, approval, and sarcasm. Attitude can be directed toward the speaker himself/ 

20 
Influence of Emotions on Language 
305 
herself, toward the listener, or toward the utterance. Further, the speaker can express 
an attitude toward either the form or the content of the utterance. For example, the 
speaker can ridicule a word or phrase by using prosody and gestures that appear to 
place it in quotes, as in: "She calls herself a 'sanitary engineer'!"; or he/she may 
communicate an attitude~approval, contempt, disbelief~about the idea expressed by 
the statement, as in: "He studies the 'emotional life' of 'rats' !" Attitude can be com- 
municated and perceived unintentionally in ways discovered by sociolinguistic studies 
(e.g., Erickson, Lind, Johnson, & O'Barr, 1978). For example, facts stated in female 
voices were rated less important than the same factual statements said by males (Gei- 
selman & Crawley, 1983). Speaking voice is a rich source of impressions about at- 
titude, mood, and personality (Banse & Scherer, 1996; Hecker, 1971; Kreiman, 1997; 
Sapir, 1926-1927; Scherer, 1979). 
20-4.1. How Does Language Express Emotion Actively? 
Prosody, or the melody of speech, takes first place in the list of media for actively 
expressing emotion in language. Its authority will usually override contradictory verbal 
content. For example, if the statement "I'm not angry!" is made with raised amplitude 
and pitch, increased duration, vocal tension, and hyperarticulated phonetic elements 
(all indicating anger), the mediummthe prosodic underlaymis the message, and the 
words are unbelievable. Both face and voice join forces to contribute affective infor- 
mation (Massaro & Egan, 1996), but the presence of a smile can be heard in the 
acoustics of the speech signal with no visual cues (Tartter, 1980). The word "right" 
can imply a broad range of meanings, from casual agreement to condemning rejection: 
"right" said with rapidly rising/falling, higher pitch means agreement and reinforce- 
ment; spoken with low, falling pitch, longer vowel and creaky voice, the same word 
indicates sarcastic repudiation. Lexicon, of course, provides a rich source of terms to 
express attitudinal information about oneself, one's reaction to the world, one's judg- 
ments, one's feelings, and so forth. Word order can be used to convey attitude and 
nuance; importance is given an element by placing it at the beginning or end of the 
sentence. Nonliteral language (e.g., idioms and proverbs) and other nonpropositional 
expressions~slang, clich6s, exclamations, and expletives~also express and evoke 
varying degrees of emotion. 
Written language, being restricted to words and syntactic structures, is relatively 
impoverished in its ability to communicate emotion, with some aid from punctuation 
(exclamation marks, italics, underscoring, and hyphens) in the formal style. Informally, 
iconic distortions of letters (e.g., large and/or boldface type to indicate loudness, wavy 
to indicate fear), reduplicated question or other punctuation marks (e.g., "You' re leav- 
ing???" to indicate surprise or shock), and other creative variations may be used to 
communicate emotional and attitudinal meanings (see Figure 1). Discourse units, 
which can use words and grammar to build scenes and ideas, provide the greatest 
emotional force in the written medium. In a demonstration of physiological emotional 
correlates of written expression, Hughes, Uhlmann, and Pennebaker (1994) recorded 
skin conductance changes while subjects wrote about traumatic experiences.

20-5. ROLE OF BRAIN DAMAGE IN EMOTIONAL 
ASPECTS 
OF LANGUAGE 
AND COMMUNICATION 
Emotional experience and behavior involve many brain structures in ways yet to be 
clearly characterized. The neuroanatomical substrate for elemental emotional behav- 
iors includes both cortical and limbic structures. Connections to the prefrontal cortex, 
cingulate gyrus, and amygdala are believed to be especially important in emotional 
expression and experience (Adolphs, Tranel, Damasio, & Damasio, 1994; Clark, 1995; 
Damasio & Van Hoesen, 1983; Devinsky, Morrell, & Vogt, 1995; LeDoux, 1995). 
Hemispheric differentiation is a distinctive feature of the human brain and has been 
of major importance in the study of higher cortical functions such that the location of 
language and practic functions in the left hemisphere of right-handers is well estab- 
lished. The right hemisphere in the hemidecorticate child may well learn language, 
but subtle differences in linguistic skill remain (Dennis & Whitaker, 1976). More 
recent work has located such disparate phenomena as visuospatial skills (Bogen, 1997) 
and recognition of familiar faces (Benton & Van Allen, 1968) and voices (Van Lancker 
& Canter, 1982) in the right hemisphere. 
Hemispheric specialization for emotional experience and its outward expression 
and comprehension is less clear (Bear, 1983). Emotional experiencing is regulated to 
a great extent by bilateral subcortical structures with multiple cortical connections. 
Both the left and right hemispheres play important roles with respect to the compre- 
hension and expression of emotion (Davidson & Tomarken, 1989; Gainotti, Caltagi- 
rone, & Zoccolotti, 1993). When considering "subcomponents" of approach- and 
withdrawal-related emotion, Davidson (1994) proposes that approach- and goal-related 
behaviors, both involving positive affect, are associated with left prefrontal cortical 
function. Verbal reports after viewing positive emotional film clips were more intense

in persons with stable frontal brain electrical asymmetry (Wheeler, Davidson, & To- 
marken, 1993). Some neurobehavioral observations suggest that damage to the left 
hemisphere leaves a patient prone to syndromes involving negative affect (catastrophic 
reactions, anxiety, depressive mood), while damage to the right hemisphere is asso- 
ciated with indifference, denial, and sometimes inappropriate jocularity (Witzelsucht) 
(Kolb & Taylor, 1981; Robinson, Kubos, Starr, Rao, & Price, 1984; Sackeim et al., 
1982). 
Besides through facial expression as described earlier, emotional information is 
conveyed in prosody (Van Lancker, 1980); words (Borod, 1993); "nonpropositional" 
(Bogen, 1969; Code, 1987; Jackson, 1874; Van Lancker, 1988) and nonliteral expres- 
sions (Myers & Linebaugh, 1981; Van Lancker & Kempler, 1987; Winner & Gardner, 
1977), and in larger "discourse" units, such as conversation and stories (Brownell & 
Martin, in press). Communicative deficits involving emotional information occur pri- 
marily in spoken production or comprehension modes. Although less common, selec- 
tive deficits in processing emotional content in reading (House, Dermot, & Standen, 
1987) or writing can occur, and repetition (Speedie, Coslett, & Heilman, 1984) of 
affective-prosodic information may be impaired. 
Deficits in prosodic production (dysprosody) and comprehension following right- 
hemisphere damage have been actively studied in recent decades (Heilman, Scholes, 
& Watson, 1975; Ross, 1980; Van Lancker, 1980). Although impaired "melody of 
speech" was first associated with left-hemisphere damage (Goodglass & Kaplan, 1972; 
Luria, 1966; Monrad-Krohn, 1947), there is evidence for a role of the right hemisphere 
in processing stimuli containing affective information (Bryden, & Ley, 1983). So far, 
no overall model accounts for the many disparate reports in studies of prosodic func- 
tion: questions arise about validity of assessments, the meaning or pertinence of proso- 
dic measures chosen, categorical versus dimensional appreciation of affective into- 
nations (Peper & Irle, 1997), other task and modality variations (Blonder, Bowers, & 
Heilman, 1992; Bowers, Coslett, Bauer, Speedie, & Heilman, 1987; Tompkins, 1991a, 
1991b), the transitory nature of the prosodic change following damage (Darby, 1993), 
or the relative role of linguistic prosody (Behrens, 1989; Shapiro & Danly, 1985; see 
Ackerman, Hertrich, & Ziegler, 1993 and Baum & Pell, in press, for reviews). A 
special difficulty lies in the lack of a model of normal prosodic performance, en- 
compassing acoustic and psychological attributes, although considerable progress to- 
ward a descriptive framework has been made by Scherer and his colleagues (see Banse 
& Scherer, 1996; Pittam & Scherer, 1993). Subcortical dysfunction may account for 
many cases of observed affective dysprosody (Cancelliere & Kertesz, 1990; Cohen, 
Riccio, & Flannery, 1994; Lalande, Braun, Charlebois, & Whitaker, 1992; Starkstein, 
Federoff, Price, Leiguarda, & Robinson, 1994; Van Lancker, Pachana, Cummings, 
Sidtis, & Erickson, 1996). The speech-timing deficits resulting from ataxic distur- 
bances in cerebellar disease may also convey an impression of affective prosodic 
disturbance. 
With acknowledgment of a significant role of the basal ganglia in affective-prosodic 
behaviors, a new look at the phenomena of "flat" speech or impaired prosody be- 
comes possible. The importance of subcortical structures to intact prosodic production 

308 
Diana Van Lancker and Nancy A. Pachana 
and comprehension is seen in Parkinson's disease (Blonder, Gur, & Gur, 1989; Darkins, 
Fromkin, & Benson, 1988; Scott, Caird, & Williams, 1984), Huntington's chorea 
(Speedie, Brake, Folstein, Bowers, & Heilman, 1990), and other dysarthrias arising 
from basal ganglia deficits (Darley, Aronson, & Brown, 1975). The importance of the 
basal ganglia in regulating the facial and prosodic expression of motivation and mood 
(Ali Cherif et al., 1984; Bhatia & Marsden, 1994; Mayeux, 1986; Mendez, Adams, 
& Lewandowski, 1989; Poncet & Habib, 1994), especially in association with con- 
nections to the frontal lobes (Cummings, 1993), gives new impetus to prosodic anal- 
ysis. In describing the relationship of phylogenetically older limbic sources of vocal- 
ization, Robinson (1976) concluded that the limbic system remains "a significant 
factor in the functioning of human speech" (p. 769). 
20-5.1. Varieties of Linguistic Phenomena as Sequelae of Brain Insult 
"Flat" or monotonous speech occurs in various neurological disorders, and has been 
associated with right- and left-hemisphere damage as well as subcortical damage; as 
yet no clear picture has emerged (Kent & Rosenbek, 1982; Meerson & Tarkhan, 1988; 
Ryalls, 1988; Ryalls & Behrens, 1988). Changes from normal values in mean fun- 
damental frequency (F0) as well as F0 variation have been seen in both left (Danly 
& Shapiro, 1982) and right (Shapiro & Danly, 1985) hemisphere-damaged subjects, 
as well as those with damage to basal ganglia structures. Patients with left-sided and 
right-sided damage did not differ in reading aloud material with emotional content 
(House et al., 1987). Postmorbid dysprosody in production may be due to mood 
changes, cognitive programming failure (apraxia), motor dysfunction (dysarthria), or 
motivational defect (abulia), while deficits in affective-prosodic comprehension may 
be attributable to deficient pitch analysis or to deficits in comprehension of verbal- 
emotional content. How the known superiority of the right hemisphere in complex 
pitch (Robin, Tranel, & Damasio, 1990; Sidtis, 1980; Sidtis, & Volpe, 1988; Twist, 
Squires, Spielholz, & Silverglide, 1991; Zatorre, 1988; Zatorre, Evans, Meyer, & 
Gjedde, 1992) and musical functions (Gordon, 1970; Gordon & Bogen, 1981; Sidtis, 
1984; Tramo & Bharucha, 1991) pertains to right-hemisphere performance on prosodic 
tasks is also unclear. A better picture of prosodic functioning will emerge when more 
is known of (a) normal human affective states; (b) prosodic-affective expression types; 
and (c) acoustic differentiation of vocal affective expression (Johnson, Emde, Scherer, 
& Klinnert, 1986). Studies of dysprosody are hampered by the fact that "the manner 
in which (acoustic and phonetic parameters) combine to signal linguistic and affective 
meaning remains elusive" (Bowers, Bauer, & Heilman, 1993, p. 436). 
Deficits in processing emotional lexical content in production and comprehension 
following focal brain damage have been described in various ways (Cicone, Wapner, 
& Gardner, 1980; Cimino, Verfaellie, Bowers, & Heilman, 1991; Rapcsak, Comer, & 
Rubens, 1993). A lack of emotional content in the spoken lexicon, associated with 
difficulty identifying and describing feeling states, is referred to as alexithymia. A1- 
exithymia (Nemiah, Freyberger, & Sifneos, 1976) refers to a dearth of emotional- 
expressive words in speech production. A lower percentage of affect-laden words and 
adjectives in written and spoken language was observed in cerebral commisurotomy 

20 
Influence of Emotions on Language 
309 
patients, probably because of the lack of right-hemisphere information available to the 
speaking-disconnected left hemisphere (TenHouten, Hoppe, Bogen, & Walter, 1986). 
There is much evidence that the right hemisphere organizes its lexicon according to 
contextual, affective, and idiosyncratic or personalized principles (Chiarello, 1988; 
Drews, 1987; Rodel, Cook, Regard, & Landis, 1992; Sidtis, Volpe, Holtzman, Wilson, 
& Gazzaniga, 1981; Zaidel, 1977). Wechsler (1973) was the first to report deficient 
output of emotional words in right-hemisphere damage. More recently, Cimino et al. 
(1991) found that autobiographical reports generated by right hemisphere-damaged 
subjects were rated as less emotional than reports by control subjects. These and like 
observations (Cicone et al., 1980) have led to the proposal of an "affect lexicon" as 
resident in the right hemisphere (Bowers et al., 1993). 
Communicative functioning called "pragmatics"--the use of language in everyday 
situationsmmay have significant representation in the right hemisphere (Brownell & 
Joanette, 1993; Joanette & Brownell, 1990; Joanette, Goulet, & Hannequin, 1990; 
Perecman, 1983). Inability to perceive or to produce figurative meanings and verbal 
humor contributes to an impoverished emotional communicative function, and is often 
associated with right-hemisphere dysfunction (Bihrle, Brownell, Powelson, & Gardner, 
1986; Brownell, Michel, Powelson, & Gardner, 1983; Myers & Linebaugh, 1981; Van 
Lancker, 1990; Van Lancker & Kempler, 1987). Difficulty with appreciating polite 
and indirect requestsmstatements that ask for an action implicitly but are structured 
as a question or factual statementmhas also been identified with right-hemisphere 
damage (Weylman, Brownell, Roman, & Gardner, 1989). Persons with severe 
nonfluent aphasia frequently produce well-articulated speech formulas and exple- 
tives, which may or may not appear to express affect (Code, 1997; Van Lancker, 
1988). 
Failure to process familiar content, or personal relevance, which involves affect, 
forms another communicative deficiency, and has also been associated with damage 
to the right hemisphere; examples are in processing of proper nouns denoting familiar- 
famous and familiar-intimate persons (Ellis & Young, 1990; Van Lancker & Nicklay, 
1992; Wallace & Canter, 1985). The right hemispheres of split-brain patients were 
observed to recognize familiar-famous and familiar-intimate names and faces and to 
do so with considerable affective response (Sperry, Zaidel, & Zaidel, 1979). Brain 
damage to the right parietal lobe has been found to impair familiar voice recognition 
but not the ability to discriminate between unfamiliar voices; an autonomic correlate 
of this dissociation has been reported for face recognition (Van Lancker, Kreiman, & 
Cummings, 1989). 
Psychiatric conditions have been associated with prosodic deficits in production 
(Alpert, Rosen, Welkowitz, Sobin, & Borod, 1989) and comprehension (Murphy & 
Cutting, 1990), as well as florid content in grammar and lexicon, producing bizarre 
words; this is especially true of schizophrenia and mania (Critchley, 1964; Cummings, 
1985). Alexithymia as a "disturbance in emotional awareness" was found to be mea- 
surably present in patients with bulimia nervosa (de Groot, Rodin, & Olmstead, 1995). 
Hypophonic and slowed speech is characteristic of the depressed patient; some re- 
searchers (e.g., Greden, Albala, Smokier, Gardner, & Carroll, 1981) have noted in- 
creased speech pause time and decreases in volume at the end of sentences in 

310 
Diana Van Lancker and Nancy A. Pachana 
depressed patients. Diagnostic subtypes of depressed patients perform differently on 
acoustic-perceptual tests (Bruder et al., 1989). As depression is a prominent psychiatric 
symptom in many diseases of the extrapyramidal system (e.g., Huntington's chorea, 
Parkinson's disease), changes in speech similar to those seen in depression are ob- 
served in these patients as well. Some aphasic disturbances, having multiple etiologies 
(mutism, echolalia, perseveration), may resemble language disorders associated with 
psychiatric disease (Duffy, 1995); frustration, depression, and disordered self-aware- 
ness may also occur as sequelae of aphasia, sometimes evolving to paranoia (Benson, 
1973). 
Vocal and speech automatisms as well as affective automatisms (epileptic laughter, 
crying) are sometimes seen in those affected with temporal lobe epilepsy (Serafetin- 
ides & Falconer, 1963; Sethi & Rao, 1976). Hypergraphia with broad affective content 
and excessive verbal religiosity may form part of the profile of the temporal lobe 
epileptic patient. Lesions of the right temporal lobe were associated with excessive 
talk (Kolb & Taylor, 1981). A strong case for the role of the right hemisphere in 
psychiatric disorders, as manifested by some of the defective communicative functions 
described here, has been made by Cutting (1990). 
Dementing disorders produce a range of disturbances in cognitive and affective 
functioning that may severely limit the comprehension and production of meaningful 
linguistic and emotional communication. Language disturbances form part of the di- 
agnostic criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease, the most common of the cortical 
dementias. In the cortical dementias, speech, while well articulated, becomes relatively 
empty of affective and informational content (Cummings & Benson, 1992) while 
grammatic function is relatively preserved. Ability to interpret idioms and proverbs, 
containing complex affective and ideational material, is impaired very early in the 
course of the disease (Kempler, Van Lancker, & Read, 1988), while anecdotal evidence 
suggests that familiar speech formulas such as greetings and leave-taking are used 
fluently, if not always context-appropriately. Impaired theme and topic maintenance 
in pragmatic communication are an early symptom (Tomoeda & Bayles, 1993). In- 
terestingly, spouses adopt a specialized speech register when communicating with 
adults with probable Alzheimer's disease, reducing syntactic and semantic complexity, 
and increasing references to more obvious elements in their descriptions (Kemper, 
Anagnopoulos, Lyons, & Heberlein, 1994). In the subcortical dementias, speech ar- 
ticulation and prosodic range may be affected, and grammatical forms may become 
restricted to simple sentence types; writing is also affected (Cummings, 1986). Deficits 
in spontaneity may also affect use of speech formulas in conversational interaction. 
20-6. CONCLUSIONS 
Emotion, affect, and attitudes have an immense influence on normal speech/language 
ability and in communication disorders. These qualities consistently inform and un- 
derlie speech, provide much of the expressive and informative lexical content of lan- 
guage, and constitute much of the fabric of communicative pragmatics. 

20 
Influence of Emotions on Language 
311 
Specific communicative disorders selectively involve the affective content of 
speech, language, or pragmatics. Dysprosody refers to failed signaling or identification 
of affective and attitudinal cues in the physical speech signal. For language, alexithy- 
mia involves defective recognition or retrieval of lexical items for emotion. Impaired 
processing of personally familiar entities impacts processing of proper nouns. In com- 
munication, pragmatic deficits involve weakness in the affective glue that holds to- 
gether discourse, including nonliteral meanings, inference, interactional terms, theme, 
and humor. 
Although emotion can proceed without language, verbal communication is ordi- 
narily and normally imbued with affective and attitudinal nuances. In the communi- 
cative traditions of science, business, politics, and the like, management of affect in 
linguistic expression becomes part of every seasoned practitioner's goal. If the lin- 
guistic units that make up the structure of discoursemphonemes, words, syntactic 
phrasesmcould be considered akin to cloth, then attitudes and emotions are like the 
patterns printed on the cloth. The choice of particular words or a particular gram- 
matical construction can change sackcloth to silk. But if one is not sensitive to the 
emotional nuances of the speaker, one can miss the way those emotions color the 
words, and thereby miss some, if not all, of the full communicative meaning. Simi- 
larly, when the speaker has lost the ability to project the pattern of his/her attitudes 
and emotions onto the linguistic expression, the listener will be able to understand 
the words without being able to discern their emotional pattern. One of the greatest 
challenges in neurolinguistic research lies in understanding how brain structures in- 
tegrate to permit verbal comprehension and production of attitude and emotion in 
speech.

CHAPTER 21 
The Processing of Sign Language 
Evidence from Aphasia

Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195 
Each year in the United States roughly 80,000 persons suffer an acquired aphasia 
(Brody, 1992). Some small percentage of these cases involves deaf individuals 
whose primary means of communication is a visual-manual language; in the 
United States, this is likely to be American Sign Language (ASL). Studies of sign 
language aphasia have advanced our understanding of the contributions of sym- 
bolic, motoric, and linguistic processes in human language. Importantly, these 
studies have helped alert the medical profession to the potential effects of this 
malady in the deaf population. This chapter provides an overview of the effects 
of left- and right-hemisphere damage in users of signed languages, and explores 
the theoretical implications of these findings. One aim of this chapter is to doc- 
ument the current status of the field and to foreshadow issues that are likely to 
be of interest in future studies. 
No doubt by disease of some part of his brain the deaf-mute might lose his natural system of 
signs.

The possibility of a "sign language aphasia" has long fascinated neurolinguistic re- 
searchers. Cross-modality comparisons of human language provide some of the strong- 
est evidence to date for biological determination of human language. These studies 
provide keen insight into the determination of hemispheric specialization, neural plas- 
ticity, and the contribution of symbolic, motoric, and linguistic processes in human 
language. This chapter discusses current issues related to sign language aphasia. Pre- 
vious reviews can also be found in Kimura (1981), Poizner and Kegl (1992), and 
Poizner, Klima, and Bellugi (1987). 
21-1. ASL AND THE 
DEAF 
COMMUNITY 
American Sign Language is the language used by most of the Deaf 1 community in 
North America. ASL is a natural language, autonomous from English. ASL is only 
one of the many sign languages of the world, but it is the one that has been the most 
extensively studied. Under ideal circumstances, ASL is acquired as a native language 
by deaf children from deaf signing parents. However, the majority of deaf individuals 
have hearing parents and siblings. These deaf children are traditionally socialized into 
the signing Deaf community either when they enter residential school (often not until 
age 5 or later) or at some later point as adults (Meadows, 1980). It is often assumed 
that all deaf people can sign and that all deaf people can read lips fluently. In reality, 
deaf people's language skills vary considerably. Biological hearing loss alone does 
not ensure competence in signing, nor does education ensure competence in English. 
Some factors that contribute to language skills in the deaf include parental input, age 
of language acquisition, schooling, and affiliation with other deaf signing individuals 
(for discussion of these issues, see Grosjean, 1982; Kettrick & Hatfield, 1986; 
Markowicz & Woodward, 1978; Newport & Meier, 1985; Meier, 1991; Padden & 
Humphries, 1988; Ramsey, 1989). Clinicians assessing deaf patients should be cog- 
nizant of the factors that influence language competence in this population. 
21-2. LINGUISTIC 
STRUCTURE 
OF AMERICAN 
SIGN LANGUAGE 
Within the last decade there has been a monumental increase in our knowledge of the 
formal structure of signed languages. Advances in sign language linguistics come at 
an opportune time; there is growing awareness that profiles of neurolinguistic impair- 
ment must be characterized against a backdrop of the language-specific variation (see 
for example Bates & Wulfeck, 1989). In this section, we review characteristics of the 
linguistic structure of ASL. 
~The capitalization of the word deaf in this context serves to signify recognition of deaf indi- 
viduals as a distinct cultural group, who function within a minority community and whose primary 
language is signed (see Lane, 1984; Padden, & Humphries, 1988 for discussions). 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
315 
21-2.1. Sign Phonology 
Phonological organization refers to the patterning of the formational units of the ex- 
pression system of natural language (Coulter & Anderson, 1993). For signed lan- 
guages, these formational units refer to abstract articulatory and visual primitives. ASL 
signs are constructed from a limited set of formational elements drawn from four main 
articulatory parameters: movement, location, handshape, and orientation (Stokoe, Cas- 
terline, & Corneberg, 1965). Recognition of a syllabic unit of organization in ASL 
phonology has given rise to the identification of "consonantal" and "vocalic" com- 
ponents of sign forms (see Corina & Sandler, 1993, for an overview). 
21-2.2. Sign Morphology 
ASL has complex grammatical and lexical morphology. ASL lexical morphology per- 
mits creation of new sign forms, while grammatical morphology serves to modulate 
aspects of meaning and permutes the shape of signs in accordance with syntactic 
requirements. Morphological markings in ASL are unusual as they are expressed as 
dynamic movement patterns superimposed on a more basic sign form. The prevalence 
of nested morphological forms, in contrast to the linear suffixation common in spoken 
languages, is considered a reflection of the modality of expression on the realization 
of linguistic structure (Emmorey, Corina, & Bellugi, 1995; Klima & Bellugi, 1979). 
Two forms of ASL lexical morphology have received increased attention in the sign 
aphasia literature: the ASL classifier system and the ASL grammatical facial expres- 
sion system. 
21-2.3. ASL Classifiers 
In many languages (spoken and signed), object and action descriptions require use of 
obligatory grammatical morphemes that specify salient semantic or visual properties 
of noun and verb referents. In ASL, classifiers mark semantic categories, such as 
human, animal, and vehicle, and visual properties, like flat, thin, and round. Classifiers 
in ASL function as verbs of motion and location, specifying the path and the direction 
of movement of their noun referent (Newport & Supalla, 1980; Supalla, 1986). The 
system of classifiers is unusual in its conflation of linguistic and visual object prop- 
erties. The classifier system is one of the most difficult aspects of ASL grammar, and 
poses a particular problem for nonnative users of ASL. Recent investigations suggest 
that right-hemisphere lesions may in some cases selectively impair use of this unusual 
morphological system. 
21-2.4. ASL Facial Expression 
Another unusual aspect of ASL morphology concerns the grammatical function of 
facial expressions. Certain syntactic constructions (e.g., topics, conditionals, relative 
clauses, questions) are marked by specific and obligatory facial expressions. ASL 

316 
David Corina 
facial expressions also signal adverbial markings, co-occurring with and modifying 
verb phrases. Linguistic facial expressions are distinct markers that differ significantly 
in appearance and execution from those universal affective facial expressions identi- 
fied by Ekman and Friesen (1978). Recognition studies of facial expression by deaf 
signers indicate bilateral mediation of facial expressions, which contrasts with the 
strong right-hemisphere advantage shown by hearing persons (Corina, 1989). 
21-2.5. ASL Syntax 
ASL makes use of two strategies for distinguishing grammatical relations: word order 
(which is SVO in the majority of cases) and inflectional morphology. A prominent 
feature of ASL syntax is the use of signing space for the depiction of grammatical 
relations. At the syntactic level, nominals introduced into the discourse are assigned 
arbitrary reference points in a horizontal plane of signing space. Signs with pronominal 
function are directed toward these points and many verb signs obligatorily move be- 
tween these points in specifying grammatical relations (subject of, object of) (see 
Lillo-Martin, 1991; Lillo-Martin & Klima, 1990 for discussions). Thus grammatical 
functions served in many spoken languages by case marking or by linear ordering of 
words are fulfilled in ASL by spatial mechanisms (Klima & Bellugi, 1979). 
21-2.6. ASL Discourse 
The system of spatial reference is also used in the service of discourse relations. 
Consistency in cross-sentential spatial indexing serves as a means of discourse co- 
hesion. The status of spatial locations used in the service of syntactic and discourse 
function in ASL is not well understood. An important question is whether spatial 
locations, which serve coreferential and anaphoric functions, should be treated as part 
of the linguistic representation or whether these physical spatial locations are merely 
deictic in nature (see Emmorey et al., 1995; Liddell, 1990, 1994). As will be discussed 
later in this chapter, this seemingly esoteric distinction has implications for the inter- 
pretation of syntactic deficits observed in signers who have incurred brain damage. 
21-2.7. Fingerspelling 
In addition to American Sign Language, there exists the American manual alphabet. 
In this system, the letters of the English alphabet are represented by 26 distinct con- 
figurations of the hand, and meaningful units (English words as represented by their 
letters) are conveyed by sequences of these configurations. Fingerspelling provides 
one avenue for borrowing new English vocabulary into ASL (Klima & Bellugi, 1979). 
The execution and comprehension of fingerspelling incorporates processes involved 
in spelling and reading (Wilcox, 1992). 
In summary, ASL exhibits formal organization at the same levels found in spoken 
language. In signed languages, we find sublexical structure analogous to a phonemic 
level, and a level that specifies the precise ways that meaningful units are bound 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
317 
together to form complex words and sentences analogous to morphological and syn- 
tactic levels. Recent studies have described discourse conventions in ASL, as well as 
unusual morphological constructions including ASL classifiers and linguistic facial 
expressions. These studies provide a basis for evaluating aphasic symptoms in deaf 
signers. 
21-3. A SUMMARY OF SIGN LANGUAGE APHASIA 
Sixteen cases of deaf or signing individuals who have incurred left-hemisphere 
brain damage and five cases of right hemisphere-damaged signers are summarized in 
Table 1. These case studies vary greatly in their contribution to understanding the 
brain processes involved in signing. Many of the early case studies were hampered 
by the lack of understanding of the relationships among systems of communication 
utilized by deaf individuals. For example, several of the early studies compare dis- 
ruptions of fingerspelling and only briefly mention or assess sign language use. Studies 
often fail to establish premorbid language histories. These case studies include reports 
on the congenitally deaf, adventitiously deaf, native and nonnative signers, right- 
handed and left-handed signers, making generalizations from these cases difficult. 
Anatomical localization of lesions is often lacking or confounded by the existence of 
multiple infarcts, and rarely are audiological reports presented. Nevertheless, with 
careful reading, general patterns emerge and contribute to our understanding of sign 
language representation in the brain. More recently, well-documented studies are start- 
ing to provide a clearer picture of the neural systems involved in language processing 
in users of signed languages. Our discussions will be largely based on this later series 
of subjects. 
21-4. HEMISPHERIC SPECIALIZATION 
IN DEAF SIGNERS 
Two prominent issues concerning brain organization in signers are whether left- 
hemisphere structures mediate sign languages of the deaf, and whether deaf individuals 
show complementary hemispheric specialization for language and nonlanguage vi- 
suospatial skills. One conclusion that can be drawn from the sign aphasia literature is 
that right-handed deaf signers, like hearing persons, exhibit language disturbances 
when critical left-hemisphere areas are damaged. Of the 16 left-hemisphere cases listed 
in Table 1, 12 cases provide sufficient detail to implicate left-hemisphere structures 
in sign language disturbances (cases 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)(see 
Table 1). Five cases provide neuroradiological or autopsy reports to confirm left- 
hemisphere involvement, and provide compelling language assessment to implicate 
aphasic language disturbance (cases 2, 5, 10, 12, 16). Five cases of signers with right- 
hemisphere pathology have been reported (cases 17, 18, 19, 20, 21). All five of these 
signers showed moderate to severe degrees of nonlanguage visuospatial impairment. 
In contrast, none of the left hemisphere-damaged signers tested on nonlanguage

visuospatial tests were shown to have significant impairment. A recent group com- 
parison reaches similar conclusions (Hickok, Bellugi, & Klima, 1996). Taken together, 
these findings suggest that deaf signers show complementary specialization for lan- 
guage and nonlanguage skills. These studies demonstrate that development of hemi- 
spheric specialization is not dependent on exposure to oral/aural language.

OF SIGN 
LANGUAGE 
APHASIA 
21-5.1. Sign Language Production 
A common question concerning the assessment of aphasia in deaf signers is the ap- 
parent effect of hemiplegia or motoric weakness on signing behavior. Sign languages 
use both hands for sign formation but anatomical handedness is not contrastive in 
ASL. There is an asymmetrical relationship between the two hands in ASL signing. 
Only one hand takes the role of the "dominant" articulator, the other hand acting as 
a mirror copy of the dominant hand or in some cases as a passive place of articulation, 
with a reduced inventory of possible handshapes (i.e., the dominant moves to and 
contacts the passive, nondominant hand). In everyday activities, it is often the case 
that both hands are not available for signing. Sign languages have subsequently de- 
veloped adaptations to compensate for this natural state of affairs (see Battison, 1978; 
Vaid, Bellugi, & Poizner, 1989 for a discussion). In informal signing, there is a general 
tendency to reduce many two-handed signs to more colloquial one-handed forms. 
Thus, signers who have become hemiplegic are not overly challenged by the lack of 
an articulator. Moreover, we are confident that sign aphasia is not due to motoric 
factors when, for example, paraphasic sign formation errors appear on the nonhemi- 
plegic hand. Finally, linguistic analysis of errors is able to differentiate lack of artic- 
ulatory or motoric agility from linguistic substitutions (see Sections 5.2 and 5.3). 
21-5.2. Phonemic Paraphasias in ASL 
Spoken language phonemic paraphasias arise from substitution or omission of the 
sublexical phonological components (Blumstein, 1973). In ASL, sublexical structure 
refers to the formational elements that compose a sign form: handshape, location, 
movement, and orientation. Sign language phonological paraphasias result in substi- 
tutions within these parameters. Phonological paraphasias in sign aphasia do not ap- 
pear to affect the syllabic integrity of the sign forms (Brentari, Poizner, & Kegl, 1995). 
In principle, selectional errors could occur among any of the four sublexical par- 
ameters. For example, subject L.K. (case 10) produced paraphasic signing errors in 
which substitutions were found in all four major parameters. The sign ENJOY, for 
example, which requires a circular movement of the hand, was articulated with an 
incorrect up-and-down movement. Substitutions in the parameters of orientation, hand- 
shape, and location are also reported (see Poizner, Klima, & Bellugi, 1987). However, 
the most frequently reported errors are those affecting the handshape parameter. 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
321 
Corina, Poizner, Feinberg, Dowd, and O'Grady (1992) describe in some detail the 
phonemic errors produced by W.L. (case 16), which almost entirely affect handshape 
specifications. For example, W.L. produced the sign TOOTHBRUSH with the Y hand- 
shape rather than the required G handshape, and produced the sign SISTER with an 
F handshape rather than the required L handshape (see Figure 1). Based upon a lin- 
guistic analysis of these types of errors, Corina, Poizner, et al. (1992) argue that these 
handshape substitutions are phonemic in nature rather than simply phonetic misar- 
ticulations. 
The preponderance of handshape substitution errors is interesting in that recent 
linguistic analyses of ASL have suggested that static location and handshape specifi- 
cations may be more consonantal in nature while movemental components of ASL 
may be analogous to vowels. One of the most striking asymmetries in spoken language 
phonemic paraphasia is that errors overwhelmingly favor consonant distortions. 
Whether the vulnerability of consonants relative to vowels reflects a neural difference 
in representation or results from the statistical differences in inventory or articulatory/ 
acoustic variables (e.g., degree of freedom before misarticulating a consonant or a 
vowel is detected as an error) is not well understood. The fact that across spoken and 
signed languages phonemic errors involve "consonantal" attributes of language is 
intriguing.

21-5.3. Morphology and Syntax Errors 
A common error pattern in spoken language aphasia is the substitution and/or omission 
of bound and free morphemes. Languages differ in the degree to which they use 
morphology to mark obligatory grammatical distinctions (case and gender, subject and 
object agreement, etc.), and patterns of impairment may be more striking in some 
languages than others (Bates, Wulfeck, & MacWhinney, 1991; Menn & Obler, 1990). 
ASL is a highly inflected language; morphosyntactic agreement distinguishing gram- 
matical subject and object requires directional movement trajectories in certain classes 
of ASL verbs. In the absence of grammatical movement trajectories, a verb sign will 
be produced in an uninflected "citation" form. Poizner et al. (1987) have investigated 
their patients particularly thoroughly in this morphosyntactic realm. Poizner's patient 
G.D. (case 12), consistently omitted required inflectional morphemes in her sponta- 
neous signing, and instead produced uninflected "citation" verb forms. Poizner's pa- 
tient ED. (case 11) produced both omissions in inflectional morphology and incon- 
sistent verb agreement; that is, P.D. failed to maintain consistent verb movement 
trajectories to spatial locations as is required by syntactic and discourse conventions. 
G.D. had a large left-hemisphere lesion that involved most of the convexity of the 
left frontal lobe, including Broca's area. P.D. had a subcortical lesion in the left 
hemisphere with anterior focus deep to Broca's area, and the lesion extended pos- 
teriorly into the white matter in the left parietal lobe. The general pattern of 
omissions versus substitutions in signers G.D. and ED., respectively, is consistent 
with profiles of agrammatic and paragrammatic impairment reported for users of spo- 
ken language. 
In addition to the morphosyntactic processes, ASL makes rich use of morphological 
devices to express aspectual distinctions. Subject G.D. omitted morphologically com- 
plex forms across the board, omitting not only morphosyntactic forms but temporal 
and distributional inflections as well. Poizner et al. (1987) report in detail some un- 
usual aspectual morphological errors produced by signer P.D. These errors involved 
semantically inappropriate inflections on a variety of lexical forms that do not sub- 
categorize for these inflections. For example, they report the sign BRILLIANT as 
undergoing inflection for predispositional aspect, which only applies to adjectives with 
transitory quality (but here has been applied to an adjective with inherent quality). To 
my knowledge, constructions of morphological neologistic forms that violate subca- 
tegorization has not been reported for spoken language, even in languages such as 
Hungarian (MacWhinney & Osman-Sagi, 1991) or Turkish (Slobin, 1991) with highly 
complex morphology. Whether these ASL errors reflect differences in the patterning 
of morphological impairment in signed versus spoken languages or represent non- 
aphasic symptomology in this older subject is not well understood. 
21-5.4. Sign Language Comprehension 
In hearing individuals, severe language comprehension deficits are associated with 
left-hemisphere posterior lesions, especially posterior temporal lesions. Similar 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
323 
patterns have been observed in users of signed languages. For example, W.L. (case 
16) and L.K. (case 10), who have damage to posterior temporal structures, evidenced 
marked comprehension deficits. W.L. showed a gradation of impairment, with some 
difficulty in single sign recognition, moderate impairment in following commands, 
and severe problems with complex ideational material. Subject L.K. showed severe 
comprehension problems, especially of multipart commands. In each of these cases, 
comprehension was assessed against a backdrop of aphasic production deficits. In 
contrast, Hickok, Klima, Kritchevsky, and Bellugi, (1995) have reported a case of a 
signer with severely impaired sign comprehension, but well preserved nonaphasic 
language production. This subject had a left-hemisphere lesion involving medial tem- 
poral and occipital lobes, left occipital pole, and white matter tracks that give rise to 
the splenium of the corpus callosum. Sign comprehension at the sentence level was 
severely impaired, while single sign comprehension was reasonably intact, with oc- 
casional semantic field errors in confrontation naming. Hickcok et al., (1995) argue 
for a comprehension deficit based on a disconnection syndrome in which visual in- 
formation from the intact right visual field was unable to project to the language region 
of the left hemisphere (like alexia without agraphia). 
In summary, evidence from lesion studies of deaf signers indicates left-hemisphere 
dominance for sign language processing, and the familiar patterns of comprehension 
and production deficits following posterior and anterior damage, respectively. These 
findings provide evidence that language impairments following stroke in deaf signers 
are indeed aphasic in nature, and do not reflect general problems in symbolic con- 
ceptualization or motor behavior. In addition, the dissociation syndrome described by 
Hickok et al. (1995), illustrates the intimate relationships between neural systems 
involved in visual processing and sign language processing, not unlike those posited 
for auditory and spoken language processing (Geschwind, 1965). Finally, there is good 
evidence for hemispheric specialization for both language and nonlanguage func- 
tions in deaf signers. We now turn to a more thorough description of sign language 
aphasia and return to a detailed discussion of neuroanatomical specialization for sign 
language. 
21-6. WITHIN-HEMISPHERE 
LOCALIZATION 
Hemispheric specialization in deaf signers broadly mirrors the specialization found in 
hearing individuals. A more challenging question concerns the extent to which the 
neuroanatomical systems responsible for mediating auditory languages participate in 
visual sign languages. This question has important theoretical implications. Common 
anatomical substrates would provide support for a modality-neutral neural system of 
human language processing. The existence of such a system has been taken by some 
to lend validity to the constructs of languages as biologically determined and cogni- 
tively encapsulated (Bellugi, Bihrle, & Corina, 1991; Fromkin, 1991). On the other 
hand, differences in the anatomical substrates of spoken and signed languages sug- 
gests some degree of plasticity in the neural systems underlying human languages. 

324 
David Corina 
Significant anatomical differences in language representation may indicate that there 
are many ways to instantiate functional human language in the brain. Behavioral 
evidence to date suggests a role for both biologically determined mechanisms and 
influences of environmental constraints in the development of signed and spoken lan- 
guages (Neville, 1990). 
21-6.1. Nonfluent Aphasia 
It is generally accepted that lasting Broca's aphasia in a hearing person requires a 
lesion encompassing the cortical Broca's area (pars opercularis and pars triangularis) 
of the left frontal lobe, often extending posteriorly to include the lower portion of the 
motor strip. The lesion must extend in depth to the periventricular white matter, be- 
cause a purely cortical or shallow lesion produces only a transient disorder (Mohr et 
al., 1978; Goodglass, 1993). One question that arises in the study of Broca-like sign 
aphasia is the degree to which there is overlap in the premotor regions. Levine and 
Sweet (1982) provide evidence that for users of spoken language, pure cases of 
Broca's aphasia without associated agraphia may be limited to inferior regions of the 
precentral gyrus, while more extensive lesions extending dorsally may result in a 
Broca's aphasia with associated agraphia. Thus, agraphia may result from involvement 
of arm and hand representations of the sensorimotor cortex. It may be possible to use 
agraphia as a metric for determining degree of overlap between signed and spoken 
language aphasia; that is, is it the case that all Broca-like sign aphasics also have 
associated agraphia or are the linguistic representations underlying writing and signing 
functionally distinct and dissociable? Two cases in the literature provide sufficient 
detail to make some tentative observations concerning anatomical areas involved in 
nonfluent Broca-like aphasia in sign language. 
Tureen, Smolik, and Tritt (1951) (case 5) describe production problems follow- 
ing hemorrhage of a tumor in the frontal lobe affecting the second and third frontal 
convolution and the tip of the internal capsule. Importantly, this subject was un- 
able to use his nonaffected left hand for signing, fingerspelling, or writing. Poizner 
et al.'s (1987) subject G.D. presents with Broca-like signing and has damage to 
areas 44 and 45 of the frontal lobe. G.D. evidences agrammatic signing and writ- 
ten language output following her stroke. In addition, G.D. shows considerable 
problems with fingerspelling. Finally, and more speculatively, is Douglass and 
Richardson's (1959) subject (case 6). This patient showed impairment of sign pro- 
duction and fingerspelling, and is described as dysgraphic. Perseverative errors and 
substitutions were found in all modes of communication. Unfortunately, neuroana- 
tomical localization is only inferred from behavioral deficits in this patient. Thus, 
in three cases where there are well-described productive sign language impair- 
ments, we find associated disturbances in both writing and fingerspelling. The sim- 
ilarities of the disturbances in the nonaffected hand across modalities of manual 
expression are suggestive of a common disturbance. These few studies may imply 
that nonfluent signing aphasias require involvement of classic Broca's area and 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
325 
encroachment upon cortical and subcortical motor areas of the precentral gyrus in- 
volved in hand and arm representations. 
21-6.2. Fluent Aphasia 
Fluent aphasias are associated with lesions to posterior temporal-parietal regions. Wer- 
nicke's aphasia, for example, is typically mapped to the posterior region of the left 
superior temporal gyrus. However, it is not uncommon for lesions associated with 
Wernicke's aphasia to extend onto the lower second temporal gyrus and into the nearby 
parietal region (Damasio, 1991). Dronkers, Redern, and Ludy (1995) have reported 
that a lesion of the posterior half of the middle temporal gyrus is associated with 
chronic Wernicke's symptoms. Two prominent features of Wernicke's aphasia are im- 
paired comprehension with fluent, but often paraphasic, output (both semantic and 
phonemic). The persistent neologistic output sometimes associated with severe Wer- 
nicke's aphasia is associated with the supramarginal gyrus (Kertesz, 1993). 
Three cases of sign language aphasia resulting from posterior lesions are suffi- 
ciently detailed to permit some tentative comparisons. Leischner's (1943) case study 
(case 4) presents anatomical data based on autopsy, and reports damage to left pos- 
terior regions involving cortex and white matter associated with angular and supra- 
marginal gyri. This patient produced the closest description of jargon aphasia currently 
in the literature. The patient produced a great deal of signing, much of it wrong or 
nonsensical, with frequent perseverations, and meaningless signs. Unfortunately, com- 
prehension measures are not reported. Subjects L.K. (Chiarello, Knight, & Mandel, 
1982; Poizner et al., 1987) and W.L. (Corina, Kritchevsky, & Bellugi, 1992) each 
present with severe comprehension difficulties and relatively fluent paraphasic output. 
Interestingly, neither have lesions in the classic Wernicke's area, but rather involve 
more frontal and inferior parietal areas. In both cases, lesions extend posteriorly to 
supramarginal gyrus. Lesions associated with supramarginal gyrus alone do not typ- 
ically result in severe comprehension loss in users of spoken language. These two 
cases suggest that sign language comprehension may be more dependent on inferior 
parietal areas in the left hemisphere. This difference may reflect within-hemisphere 
reorganization for cortical areas involved in sign comprehension (Leischner, 1943; 
Poizner et al., 1987; Chiarello et al., 1982). 
In summary, these observations show that the frontal-nonfluent/posterior-fluent 
dichotomy holds for users of sign language. However, there is some suggestion that 
within-hemisphere reorganization may be present in the deaf. Broca-like sign produc- 
tion impairments may encroach upon cortical association areas involved in hand and 
arm representations. Sign comprehension deficits may be more common following 
damage to left-hemisphere inferior parietal areas not classically associated with speech 
comprehension deficits. These data suggest subtle differences in cortical organization 
of sign and speech that must be further validated. Unfortunately, the mapping of 
critical areas important in sign language mediation is hampered by the bias of positive 
cases in the literature. Equally interesting would be cases of left-hemisphere damage 
with lesions in classic language areas that do not result in sign impairment.

21-7. RIGHT HEMISPHERE 
AND LANGUAGE 
In discussing anatomical differences between users of signed and spoken language it 
is worthwhile to reconsider the evidence for right-hemisphere contributions to sign 
language processing. As stated, five right hemisphere-damaged signers show frank 
disruptions in nonlinguistic visuospatial processing. Typically, these subjects are re- 
ported to have well-preserved language. Poizner et al. (1987) stated: 
There are several lines of evidence that sign language is intact in right-lesioned signers. The 
first (and most powerful) line of evidence lies in the fact that their signing is flawless and 
without aphasic symptoms and is in contrast to the signing of deaf patients after left- 
hemisphere damage where clear and marked disruption is found. (P. 153) 
However, more recent studies suggest that this picture may be changing. We focus 
on three types of language-related problems in right hemisphere-damaged signers. 
First, as is the case with hearing persons, right-hemisphere damage in the deaf may 
disrupt the metacontrol of signed language use as evidenced by disruptions of dis- 
course abilities (Kaplan, Brownell, Jacobs, & Gardner, 1990; Rehak et al., 1992). 
Second, there is new evidence that right-hemisphere structures may be important in 
use of the ASL classifier system. Third, we examine the contribution of the right 
hemisphere in comprehension of spatialized syntax. 
21-7.1. Impaired Discourse Abilities 
There is growing evidence that the right hemisphere plays a crucial role in the dis- 
course abilities of deaf signers. Analysis of language use in right hemisphere-lesioned 
subject J.H. (case 20) (Corina et al., 1996) reveals occasional nonsequiturs and ab- 
normal attention to details, which are characteristics of the discourse of hearing 
patients with right-hemisphere lesions (Delis, Wapner, Gardner, & Moses, 1983). Sub- 
ject D.N. (case 21) reported in Poizner and Kegl (1992) shows another pattern of 
discourse disruption. Although D.N. is successful at spatial indexing within a given 
sentence, several researchers have noted that she is inconsistent across sentences (Kegl 
& Poizner, 1991; Poizner & Kegl, 1992; Emmorey et al., 1995); that is, she does not 
consistently use the same index point from sentence to sentence. In order to salvage 
intelligibility, D.N. uses a compensatory strategy in which she restates the noun phrase 
in each sentence, resulting in overly redundant content within her discourse strategy. 
The cases of J.H. and D.N. suggest that right-hemisphere lesions in signers can dif- 
ferentially disrupt discourse content (as in the case of J.H.) and discourse cohesion 
(as in the case of D.N.). 
21-7.2. Impaired Classifier Production 
Recent investigation of use of the ASL classifier system by right hemisphere-damaged 
signer D.N. reveals systematic impairment (Corina, unpublished observation). At jeop- 
ardy were D.N.'s depictions of direction and movement. For example, when asked to 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
327 
portray a small barrel hopping down a platform, D.N. signed the equivalent of a barrel 
hopping up an incorrectly inclined plank. In this example, depiction of the action 
requires coordination of the right and left hands (e.g., one to represent the barrel, the 
other, the plank). In many instances when classifier descriptions required two hands, 
D.N. showed hesitancy and repeated self-corrections. Importantly, D.N. showed no 
motor weakness that would explain these errors. Another common error is the sim- 
plification of classifier handshapes. In simple descriptions, with only one object pres- 
ent, D.N. correctly used the complex classifier handshape forms. However, in descrip- 
tions involving a precise orientation of an object, especially those including multiple 
object relations, D.N. often substituted an unmarked "generic" object classifier. This 
indicates that she is not unaware of the correct classifier handshape (as is often seen 
with nonproficient users of ASL), but instead adopts a strategy that reduces the spatial 
demands imposed by the classifier system. 
In cases of impaired discourse production and classifier use, it is reasonable to 
suppose that right-hemisphere cognitive deficits happen to manifest themselves in 
aspects of language use. Under this interpretation, right-hemisphere damage does not 
disrupt linguistic function per se, but may cause trouble in the execution and proc- 
essing of linguistic information in sign language, in which spatial information plays 
a particularly salient role. The issues become more complicated, however, when we 
consider syntactic aspects of ASL. 
21-8. ASL SYNTAX IN RIGHT- AND LEFT- 
HEMISPHERE-DAMAGED SIGNERS 
Disturbances in the syntactic processing of ASL have been attested after both left- 
and right-hemisphere damage. In the case of left-hemisphere damage, we find prob- 
lems in the production and comprehension of spatialized syntax. Left-hemisphere dam- 
aged subjects PD., W.L., and K.L. all demonstrated problems in the comprehension 
of syntactic relationships expressed via the spatial-syntactic system. Even more sur- 
prising, however, is the finding that some signers with right-hemisphere damage also 
exhibit problems. Two of the right-hemisphere damaged subjects, S.M. (case 17) and 
G.G. (case 19), tested by Poizner et al. (1987), show performance well below controls 
on two tests of spatial syntax. Indeed, as pointed out by Poizner et al. (1987), "Right 
lesioned signers do not show comprehension deficits in any linguistic test, other than 
that of spatialized syntax." A fundamental question, then, is whether these compre- 
hension deficits are similar across left and right hemisphere-damaged signers. Unfor- 
tunately, from the current literature we cannot be certain at this time. One crucial 
question, as yet unanswered, is whether the left- and right-hemisphere subjects show 
deficits in the grammatical processing of ASL syntax when it is not expressed spatially. 
Poizner et al. (1987) speculate that perceptual processing involved in the comprehen- 
sion of spatialized syntax involves both hemispheres; certain critical areas of each 
hemisphere must be relatively intact for accurate performance.

David Corina 
The deficits in syntactic comprehension in the right- and left-hemisphere subjects 
raise an interesting theoretical question, namely, should these deficits in comprehen- 
sion be considered aphasic in nature, or should they be considered secondary impair- 
ments arising from a general cognitive deficit in spatial processing? These questions 
invoke the theoretical status of linguistic structure in ASL. Are the spatial locations 
of the verb system part of the syntactic representations, or are these physical loca- 
tions merely deictic? (See Emmorey, 1996 for discussion.) If one argues that spatial 
locations are part of the linguistic representation, then one is forced to conclude that 
right-hemisphere damage in deaf adults leads to morphosyntactic impairment in lan- 
guage comprehension. Further work is required to tease apart these complicated the- 
oretical questions. 
21-9. APRAXIA 
AND SIGN LANGUAGE 
The relationship between impairments of language production and motor behavior is 
a complicated and, at times, contentious issue. When one considers impairments in 
sign language production, the issues become even more difficult to isolate, as the 
surface appearance of the disorder frequently suggests impaired motor control. There 
is great interest in studying deaf signers in reference to the distinction between aphasia 
and apraxia. One hope is that as the manual articulators are directly observable, quan- 
tification of the deficits involved may be more objective (see, for example, Brentari, 
Poizner, & Kegl, 1995). 
Convincing dissociations between sign language impairment and well-preserved 
ideomotor and ideational movements, notably conventionalized gesture and panto- 
mimed object use, are reported in Kimura, Battison, and Lubert (1976), Sarno, 
Swisher, and Sarno (1969), Chiarello et al. (1982), Poizner et al. (1987) (cases P.D. 
and K.L.), Poizner and Kegl (1992), and Corina, Poizner et al. (1992). Subject W.L., 
for example, had a marked sign language aphasia affecting both production and com- 
prehension of signs. However, W.L. produced unencumbered pantomime, often in- 
volving stretches of multisequenced pantomime to communicate ideas for which a 
single lexical sign would have otherwise sufficed. Moreover, both comprehension and 
production of pantomime were found to be better preserved than comprehension and 
production of sign language. These cases reemphasize the fact that language impair- 
ments following left-hemisphere damage are not attributable to undifferentiated sym- 
bolic impairments. More importantly, these cases demonstrate convincingly that lin- 
guistic gesture (e.g., ASL) is not simply an elaborate pantomimic system. 
A more controversial issue concerns differential impairment in meaningless manual 
movements and sign language ability. According to Kimura (1993), the left hemi- 
sphere appears to be essential for selecting most types of movement postures. Thus, 
Kimura treats language production impairments following left-hemisphere damage as 
secondary to an impairment in sequential movement programming. Two left hemi- 
sphere-damaged language-impaired signers showed impairment in copying complex 
nonlinguistic movements (Kimura et al., 1976; Chiarello et al., 1982). These findings 

21 
Sign Language Processing 
329 
are taken as support for Kimura's position that signing disorders are a manifestation 
of movement disorders. However, dissociations have been reported. Poizner et al. 
(1987) retested RD. (who was the subject of the original Kimura et al., 1976 study) 
and reported that copying nonlinguistic movements was intact at the time of testing; 
however, RD. remained severely aphasic. More recently, severely aphasic patient W.L. 
also performed within normal limits on an abbreviated version of the Kimura copying 
task (the same test used by Poizner et al., 1987), suggesting dissociation between 
linguistic impairment and sequential movement disorders (Corina, Poizner, et al., 
1992). 
In summary, there is good evidence for dissociation between ideomotor and idea- 
tional movements and signing. There is some evidence for dissociation between se- 
quential movement disorders and sign language use; however, more rigorous testing 
is required to conclusively evaluate these claims. 
21-10. CONCLUSION 
The studies to date provide ample evidence for left-hemisphere mediation of sign 
language in the deaf. Sign language disturbances following left-hemisphere damage 
show linguistically significant breakdown that is not attributable to more general prob- 
lems in motor or symbolic processing. There is also growing evidence for the role of 
the right hemisphere in sign language processing, especially in the realm of compre- 
hension. Whether these language deficits reflect general spatial-cognitive deficits or 
whether right-hemisphere neural systems function as part of a linguistic system in the 
deaf requires further investigation. Future advances in our understanding of sign lan- 
guage structure and processing will provide new answers. Recent in vivo imaging of 
blood flow in normal congenitally deaf and hearing signers also points to an increased 
role of the right hemispheremnot entirely expected, given previous lesion studies 
(Soderfeldt, Ronnberg, & Risberg, 1994; Neville et al., 1995; Hickok et al., 1995). 
Case studies of neurologically impaired signers may illuminate the necessary and 
sufficient brain areas required for sign processing, while functional imaging may pro- 
vide a picture of sign processing in the normal, nonchallenged brain. Together, these 
studies provide important insight into the biological foundation of human languages, 
and reveal degrees of neural plasticity in systems underlying functional human lan- 
guage.

Numbers can be manipulated mentally in several formats such as Arabic nota- 
tion, spelled-out numerals, and an abstract quantity representation. Neuropsy- 
chological models of number processing have attempted to specify the architec- 
ture in which mental representations of numbers are interconnected. McCloskey 
and his colleagues initially proposed a simple model with a single central abstract 
quantity representation interfaced by notation-specific input and output modules. 
Although this model sucessfully accounts for several of the peripheral deficits of 
number processing, difficulties arise with the hypothesis of an obligatory step of 
semantic interpretation of numbers. Several problematic cases suggest that there 
must be direct asemantic processing routes parallel to the semantic processing of 
numerical quantities. An alternative model, Dehaene and Cohen's triple-code 
model, describes both the functional architecture and the neural substrates of 
number processing. It successfully accounts for many types of numerical deficits, 
including the peculiar dissociations found in pure alexia, in callosotomy cases, in 
Gerstmann's syndrome, and in subcortical acalculias. 
There is a domain of language in which we are all, in some sense, bilinguals: the 
domain of numbers. Like any other category of words, numbers can be spoken 
(/four/,/forty/) or spelled out (FOUR, FORTY). However, we are all familiar with a

third symbolic notation, Arabic numerals (4, 40). Furthermore, numbers can also be 
conveyed in nonsymbolic ways such as sets of dots (::). 
The human brain must contain mental representations and processes for recogniz- 
ing, understanding, and producing these various notations of numbers and for trans- 
lating between them. Hence, the number domain provides a manageably restricted 
area within which to study the representation of symbolic information in the human 
brain and the interplay between verbal and nonverbal formats of representation. It is 
hoped that the lessons that numbers might teach us about the organization of symbol 
systems in the human brain will turn out to be generalizable to other linguistic 
domains. 
In the past decade, much progress has been made toward understanding the internal 
organization of the mental representations of numbers, their interconnections, and their 
neural substrates. In this chapter, we first describe some of the evidence for a quantity 
representation in humans, and the central role that is attributed to this quantity rep- 
resentation in McCloskey's modular model of number processing. We then discuss 
several single-case studies of patients with number-processing deficits, some that sup- 
port McCloskey's assumptions and others that seem to invalidate it. We close by 
briefly presenting the triple-code model and how it accounts for the majority of these 
cases. 
22-1. THE 
QUANTITY 
REPRESENTATION 
Moyer and Landauer's (1967) seminal study of number comparison provided the first 
strong evidence for a quantitative representation of numbers in human adults. Mea- 
suring the time that it takes to select the larger of two digits, they found a distance 
effect: number comparison becomes systematically slower as the distance between the 
two numbers decreases. It is easier to decide, say, that 9 is larger than 5 than to decide 
that 9 is larger than 8. The effect was later extended to two-digit numerals (Dehaene, 
Dupoux, & Mehler, 1990). The reaction time curve for deciding whether a two-digit 
number is larger or smaller than 65 is remarkably smooth and shows no significant 
discontinuities at decade boundaries (Figure 1). Reaction times are influenced by the 
ones digits even though the tens digit is sufficient to respond: subjects respond 
"smaller" more slowly to 59 than to 51, although the 5 in the decades position readily 
indicates that both of these numbers are smaller than 65. 
These results suggest that subjects do not compare numbers digit by digit. Rather, 
it was hypothesized that subjects mentally convert the target Arabic numeral into a 
continuous quantity, which they then compare to the reference quantity using a psy- 
chophysical procedure similar to the one used for comparing line lengths, weights, or 
other physical quantities. Several models of number comparison suppose that the hu- 
man brain incorporates an analogical representation of numerical quantities that may 
be likened to a number line. In this representation, numbers are not represented by 
discrete symbols such as digits or words, but by distributions of activation whose 
overlap indicates how similar the quantities are. Several experiments with normal

subjects confirm that the conversion from digits or number words to the corresponding 
quantities is fast and automatic and even occurs unbeknownst to the subject (review 
in Dehaene & Akhavein, 1995). 
22-2. McCLOSKEY'S MODEL 
What is the neuropsychological architecture in which Arabic, verbal, and quantity 
representations of numbers are embedded? McCloskey and his colleagues (McCloskey, 
Caramazza, & Basili, 1985; McCloskey, 1992) proposed a simple modular model that 
was to become, for a decade, the reference model for studies of number processing. 
The model places the quantity representation at a central point in processing and 
assumes that it is interfaced by specialized input and output modules. On the input 
side, a panoply of modules serves to convert Arabic digits and written or spoken 
numerals into internal quantities. On the output side, conversely, other modules are 

334 
Stanislas Dehaene and Laurent Cohen 
called for to write down Arabic digits and number words or to say numerals aloud. 
The most important assumption of the model is that each mental operation on numbers 
involves a conversion to the abstract semantic quantity representation. Arithmetic fact 
retrieval and calculation procedures, in particular, are thought to operate exclusively 
on the quantity format (Figure 2). 
McCloskey's modular stance was remarkably successful in classifying and in in- 
terpreting neuropsychological impairments of number processing as well as in dis- 
covering new dissociations. One of the first cases to be explored was patient H.Y. 
(McCloskey, Sokol, & Goodman, 1986). H.Y. made errors in reading Arabic numerals 
aloud--for instance, reading 5 as seven or 29 as forty-nine. A careful analysis indicated 
that the deficit was highly specific and modular. First, the patient still understood the 
Arabic numerals that he failed to read, as attested by his ability to compare them, to 
select a number of chips corresponding to an Arabic digit, to match an Arabic digit 
to a written word, or to verify written calculations. According to the logic of the 
model, this proved that the conversion of numerals into quantities had to be intact. 
Hence, the number reading deficit had to originate from the output side, in the process 
of converting quantities into spoken numerals. 
Second, McCloskey and his colleagues showed that writing down Arabic digits in 
response to various tasks was fairly intact (2-4% errors), while speaking aloud the 
numerical answers was significantly more impaired (8-14% errors). For instance, when 
asked the number of eggs in a dozen, the patient wrote 12 while saying sixteen. This 
suggested a rather selective deficit of the spoken production module. 
Third, a careful analysis of H.Y.'s reading errors indicated that they mostly con- 
stituted substitutions of one word for another, while the grammatical structure of hun- 
dreds, decades, and units was well preserved (e.g., stimulus 902, response nine hun- 
dred six). Furthermore, ones words were almost always replaced by other ones words,

teens words by other teens words, and tens words by other tens words. In the final 
analysis, the deficit was pinpointed to an impairment in using quantity information to 
select the phonological form of the word in lexical stacks for ones, teens, and tens 
words. When reading 15, the patient prepared to read aloud the fifth element of the 
teens category (eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen), but he mistakenly selected, 
say, the eighth element eighteen instead. Although some details of the word substi- 
tutions remained unexplained (see Campbell & Clark, 1988; Sokol, Goodman- 
Schulman, & McCloskey, 1989), the bulk of the deficit could be reduced to this highly 
restricted lesion of the modular model. 
McCloskey's model successfully predicted several other types of number processing 
deficits (reviews in McCloskey, 1992; McCloskey, & Caramazza, 1987; Caramazza 
& McCloskey, 1987). In number reading, patients similar to H.Y. were found who 
selected words in the wrong numerical category but at the correct ordinal location in 
the category (e.g., reading 2 as twelve or 15 as fifty). Others had preserved selection 
procedures for single words, but generated an incorrect syntactic sequence of words 
when producing complex numerals (e.g., reading 218 as two thousand one hundred 
and eight). 
Similar modular deficits and dissociations were found in calculation. Some patients' 
only deficit was in identifying the operation signs +, x, and so on. For others, the 
deficit was limited to arithmetic fact retrieval--they failed to retrieve single facts such 
as 2 x 3 or 5 + 5 in memory, but could otherwise execute the procedures for 
multidigit addition and multiplication to near perfection. And conversely, other pa- 
tients suffered from a selective impairment of calculation procedures, while their mem- 
ory for individual facts was intact. Hence there was a double dissociation between 
facts and procedures in calculation, compatible with McCloskey's hypothesis that these 
correspond to different number-processing modules. 
Elegant support for the model was also accrued when Macaruso, McCloskey, and 
Aliminosa (1993) showed that they could account not only for the qualitative disso- 
ciations of patients with highly selective deficits, but also for the quantitative error 
rates of a patient with multiple deficits. Patient R.H. exhibited mild to severe deficits 
in several number-transcoding tasks. For instance, he made 25% errors in reading 
Arabic numerals aloud, 21% errors in writing Arabic numerals to dictation, and 88% 
errors in converting Arabic numerals to their spelled-out form. These deficits could 
clearly not be accounted for by a single lesion site in the model. However, Macaruso 
et al. (1993) found that the patient's quantitative error rates in transcoding back and 
forth from Arabic, spelled-out, spoken, and dot notations of numbers could be ex- 
plained by assigning probabilities of errors to each component of the modular model. 
For instance, the 25% error rate in Arabic numeral reading resulted from a 3% error 
rate in the Arabic identification module and a 22% error rate in the spoken production 
module. The error types also conformed to this "multiple-deficits" analysis. For in- 
stance, the patient made word substitution errors whenever the task required spoken 
production of numbers, whether the input was in Arabic, in word, or in dot formatma 
finding compatible with the existence of a lesioned "number production module" 
shared between all these tasks. 

336 
Stanislas Dehaene and Laurent Cohen 
22-3. SOME 
PROBLEMATIC 
CASES 
In spite of these successes, McCloskey's model still generates much controversy. In 
particular, the hypothesis of a central semantic representation of numbers, accessed in 
all tasks involving numbers, is hotly debated. To take an extreme example, the model 
predicts that the mere repetition of a spoken number word necessarily involves going 
through the semantic representation--an implausible prediction, as acknowledged by 
McCloskey himself (McCloskey, 1992). The absence of a direct surface transcoding 
route, for instance, going directly from the orthographic form of a number word to 
its pronunciation, conflicts with neuropsychological evidence from language impair- 
ments outside the numerical domain. 
A first specific case that was found difficult to explain within McCloskey's frame- 
work was Cohen and Dehaene's (1991) patient Y.M. This patient showed a reading 
impairment characterized by digit substitutions (3 was read eight), an effect of visual 
similarity on errors (3 was rarely substituted with a visually dissimilar digit such as 
1), and a spatial gradient of errors (errors mostly affected the leftmost digits of mul- 
tidigit numerals). In McCloskey's framework, the fact that visual variables affected 
reading suggested a deficit within the visual Arabic identification module. Yet several 
observations conflicted with this hypothesis. Most notably, the patient was perfect in 
selecting the larger of two Arabic digits, and also surprisingly good in verifying ad- 
ditions such as 2 + 2 = 9. The data, while not fully conclusive, suggested that the 
semantic route from Arabic digits to quantities was intact, while the route from Arabic 
digits to spoken words was impaired--a pattern forbidden in McCloskey's model. 
Multiple routes also seemed necessary to explain a case reported by Cipolotti and 
Butterworth (1995). Their patient S.A.M. made frequent errors both when reading 
aloud Arabic and spelled-out numerals and when writing the same numbers down to 
dictation. Yet he was remarkably accurate in calculation tasks involving multidigit 
addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems, including tasks that required him 
to say the very same numbers that he had failed to read aloud! For instance, S.A.M. 
could say the result of 396 + 837 without error, although he made errors in reading 
these numbers aloud. This striking dissociation suggests that the ability to produce 
Arabic or verbal numerals can be specific to particular task demands. Cipolotti and 
Butterworth (1995) suggest that reading aloud and writing down numbers to dictation 
makes use of direct asemantic routes different from those used in a calculation context. 
Perhaps the clearest incompatibility with McCloskey's model came from a study 
of two patients with pure alexia (Cohen & Dehaene, 1995). Patients G.O.D. and 
S.M.A. suffered from highly similar infarcts of the left ventral occipito-temporal area, 
a region involved in high-level visual identification. Both were totally unable to read 
words. Arabic numerals were slightly better preserved: multidigit numerals were mis- 
read on 60-80% of trials and single digits on 8-18% of trials. Calculation on written 
operands was also impaired. For instance, when presented with 2 + 3, the patients 
might say seven. That these calculation errors were due to a misidentification of the 
digits was shown by (a) the patients' perfect ability to perform the same calculation 
with spoken operands, and (b) the patients' reading errors in calculation: for instance, 

22 
Number Processing 
337 
2 + 3 was read two plus five and then solved as seven, indicating that the patients 
correctly computed the sum of the operands that they had misread. 
So far, this deficit might be understood as a selective impairment of the Arabic 
number identification module. Contradicting this hypothesis, however, was the fact 
that both patients compared Arabic numerals with remarkable accuracy. When pre- 
sented with 44 pairs of two-digit numerals, for instance, neither of them made any 
errors in pointing to the larger number, whereas they made, respectively, 89% and 
91% errors in reading the very same pairs aloud. Some of the reading errors inverted 
the order of the numbers. For instance, 78 76 was read as seventy eight, seventy nine-- 
yet the patient correctly pointed to 78 as the larger number. 
This pattern of dissociation is clearly inconsistent with McCloskey's model. In this 
model, the preserved comparison of Arabic numerals should imply that the Arabic 
number identification module is intact. Similarly, the perfect performance with spoken 
inputs and outputs should mean that the verbal number comprehension, production, 
and calculation modules are intact. With all these intact components, the modular 
model should predict the reading aloud of Arabic numerals to be perfectly preserved-- 
yet it was severely impaired. Cohen and Dehaene (1995) argued that these dissocia- 
tions could only be explained by postulating two Arabic numeral identification sys- 
tems, one involved in identification for the purpose of naming (which is impaired in 
pure alexia), and the other involved in identification for the purpose of accessing the 
quantitative semantic representation (which is preserved; more on this later). 
A functionally similar case was presented by McNeil and Warrington (1994). Their 
patient H.A.R. also suffered from alexia without agraphia (although he was also apha- 
sic and suffered from naming difficulties). Just like patients G.O.D. and S.M.A., he 
experienced severe difficulties in reading Arabic numerals aloud or in calculating with 
them. Yet he could calculate with near perfection with spoken operands and he could 
also compare Arabic numerals. An additional twist was that when calculating with 
written Arabic digits, only additions and multiplications were severely impaired: the 
patient was excellent in subtracting two digits that he failed to read aloud. It seems 
that the same procedure that enabled him to convert Arabic numerals into quantities 
during number comparison could also be used for subtraction--but not for addition 
or multiplication. According to McCloskey's model, such an operation-specific and 
number-specific deficit should not exist. 
22-4. THE TRIPLE-CODE 
MODEL 
The triple-code model was introduced by Dehaene (1992; Dehaene & Cohen, 1995) 
in an effort to account for these peculiar cases. The model postulates three main 
representations of numbers (Figure 3): 
1. A visual Arabic code, localized to the left and right inferior ventral occipito- 
temporal areas, and in which numbers are represented as identified strings of 
digits. This representation, which we call the visual Arabic number form by 

338 
Stanislas Dehaene and Laurent Cohen 
analogy with Shallice's visual word form, subserves multidigit operations and 
parity judgments (e.g., knowing that 12 is even because the ones digit is a 2). 
2. An analogical quantity or magnitude code, subserved by the left and right 
inferior parietal areas, and in which numbers are represented as points on an 
oriented number line. This representation subserves semantic knowledge about 
numerical quantities, including proximity (e.g., 9 close to 10) and larger- 
smaller relations (e.g., 9 smaller than 10). 
3. A verbal code, subserved by left-hemispheric perisylvian language areas, 
in which numbers are represented as a parsed sequence of words. This 
representation is the primary code for accessing a rote verbal memory of 
arithmetic facts (e.g., "nine times nine, eighty-one"). 
Figure 3 shows the patterns of interconnections that are postulated in the model. 
In the left hemisphere, all three cardinal representations (Arabic, verbal, and quantity) 
are interconnected by bidirectional translation routes, including a direct asemantic 
route for transcoding between the Arabic and verbal representations. In the right hem- 
isphere, there are similar routes for translating back and forth between Arabic and 
quantity representations, but there is no verbal representation of numbers. Finally, it 
is assumed that the homologous Arabic and quantity representations in the two hem- 
ispheres are interconnected by direct transcallosal pathways. 
How does the model account for pure alexia patients, who were found so problem- 
atic for McCloskey's model? Their lesion affected the left ventral occipito-temporal 
area and therefore predictably impaired the left visual word and number identification 
system. Hence, left-hemispheric verbal areas could not be directly informed about the 
identity of the visual stimulus, resulting in a severe impairment of reading aloud. 
Since the memory retrieval of rote arithmetic facts is assumed to depend on the verbal 
format, this reading deficit entailed a calculation deficit--the patients could not turn 
3 • 3 into the verbal format three times three, which was necessary for them to 
retrieve the result nine. Yet the verbal circuit itself was intact, only deprived of visual 
inputs. Hence the patients could still calculate when an arithmetic problem was read

aloud to them. And finally, their right hemisphere was fully intact, including its visual 
identification and magnitude representation areas. According to the triple-code model, 
these preserved right-hemispheric circuits underlie the patients' ability to compare the 
magnitudes of Arabic numerals that they fail to read (Cohen & Dehaene, 1995). 
Very similar interpretations account for the above-described patients Y.M. (Cohen 
& Dehaene, 1991) and H.A.R. (McNeil & Warrington, 1994). Although we know 
very little about how mental subtraction is performed, clearly we do not learn sub- 
traction tables by rote as we do for addition and multiplication. Dehaene and Cohen 
(1995) speculate that subtraction is more similar to number comparison and involves 
quantitative manipulations rather than rote verbal retrieval. This may explain why 
patient H.A.R. could still subtract Arabic numerals, while his inability to read them 
aloud severely affected his ability to add or multiply them. 
A strength of the triple-code model is that it specifies cerebral localizations, how- 
ever coarse, for the various representations of numbers. As a result, the model can 
predict the effect of specific anatomical lesions on number processing. A case in point 
is the split-brain syndrome. When the corpus callosum is severed, the model predicts 
that the left hemisphere should remain able to perform all sorts of calculations, because 
it contains the three cardinal representations of numbers (Arabic, verbal, and quantity). 
The right hemisphere, however, should be able to recognize Arabic numerals, to re- 
trieve the quantity that they represent, but not to read aloud nor to perform calculations 
dependent on the verbal code. This predicted pattern of results is exactly what is 
found, both in the classical literature on split brains (Gazzaniga & Hillyard, 1971; 
Gazzaniga & Smylie, 1984; Seymour, Reuter-Lorenz, & Gazzaniga, 1994) and in a 
single-case study of number processing following an infarct of the posterior half of 
the corpus callosum (Cohen & Dehaene, 1996). When digits 5 and 6 are flashed in 
the left hemifield, the patients' right hemisphere can decide that 5 is smaller than 6, 
but it cannot read the digits aloud nor calculate 5 + 6. Similar results suggesting a 
right-hemispheric ability restricted to quantitative processing have been obtained in 
patients with extended left-hemispheric lesions (Dehaene & Cohen, 1991; Grafman, 
Kampen, Rosenberg, Salazar, & Boiler, 1989). Patient N.A.U., for instance, could not 
tell whether 2 + 2 was 3, 4, or 5rebut he knew that it had to be smaller than 9. 
The triple-code model also accounts for some of the various types of acalculias 
and their anatomical correlates. According to the model, there are two basic routes 
through which a simple single-digit arithmetic problem such as 4 + 2 can be solved. 
In the first, direct route, which works only for overlearned addition and multiplication 
problems, the operands 4 and 2 are transcoded into a verbal representation of the 
problem ("four plus two"), which is then used to trigger completion of this word 
sequence using rote verbal memory ("four plus two, six"). This process is assumed 
to involve a left cortico-subcortical loop through the basal ganglia and thalamus. In 
the second, indirect semantic route, the operands are encoded into quantity represen- 
tations held in the left and right inferior parietal areas. Semantically meaningful ma- 
nipulations are then performed on these internal quantities, and the resulting quantity 
is then transmitted from the left inferior parietal cortex to the left-hemispheric peri- 
sylvian language network for naming. The model assumes that this indirect semantic 

340 
Stanislas Dehaene and Laurent Cohen 
route is used whenever rote verbal knowledge of the operation result is lacking, most 
typically for subtraction problems. 
The two types of acalculic patients predicted by these two routes for calculation 
have now been identified (Dehaene & Cohen, in press). There are several published 
cases of acalculia following a left subcortical infarct (Whitaker, Habiger, & Ivers, 
1985; Corbett, McCusker, Davidson, 1988; Hittmair-Delazer, Semenza, & Denes, 
1994). In a recent case of a left lenticular infarct, Dehaene and Cohen (in press) 
showed that, as predicted by the model, only rote verbal arithmetic facts such as 3 • 
3 were impaired (together with rote verbal knowledge of the alphabet, nursery rhymes, 
and prayers). Quantitative knowledge of numbers was fully preserved, as shown by 
the patient's intact number comparison, proximity judgment, and simple addition and 
subtraction abilities. Hittmair-Delazer et al. (1994) likewise observed a preservation 
of conceptual, quantitative, and algebraic manipulations of numbers in their severely 
acalculic patient with a left subcortical lesion. 
Conversely, the model predicts that lesions of the left inferior parietal area, typically 
resulting in Gerstmann's syndrome, affect calculation because they destroy quantitative 
knowledge while preserving rote verbal abilities. Indeed, Dehaene and Cohen (in 
press) observed a Gerstmann-type patient who could still read aloud numbers and 
write them down to dictation, still knew rote addition and multiplication facts such as 
2 + 2 and 3 x 3, and yet failed even in the simplest of quantitative tasks. He made 
16% errors in larger-smaller comparison, 75% errors in simple subtractions (including 
gross errors such as 3 - 1 = 3 or 6 - 3 = 7), and 78% errors in number bisection 
(stating, for instance, that 3 falls in the middle of 4 and 8). The deficit was highly 
specific to the category of numbers, since the patient performed quite well in finding 
the middle of two letters, two days of the week, two months of the year, or two notes 
of the musical scale. We have now observed several such cases of severe number 
bisection deficits following a lesion of the inferior parietal area. These cases support 
the triple-code model's hypothesis that this area is critical for representing and ma- 
nipulating number as quantities. 
22-5. SOME 
OPEN 
ISSUES IN 
NUMBER 
PROCESSING 
In spite of the progress made in understanding the architecture for number processing 
in the human brain, many gaps remain to be filled. 
First, while we begin to understand the large-scale networks for number processing, 
further studies are needed to better understand the internal structure of representations, 
particularly the verbal representations used for accessing rote arithmetic facts. 
Second, the issue of hemispheric specialization is still largely unsolved. Both hem- 
ispheres are clearly able to identify Arabic numerals and to represent the associated 
quantities. Yet, are the left and right representations equivalent, or are there differences 
between the magnitude representations available to the left and right hemispheres? 
Would the left hemisphere be categorical while the right would hold a more contin- 

22 
Number Processing 
341 
uous, analogical representation of numbers? This important question remains to be 
addressed. 
Finally, an issue that has emerged is the extent to which other types of mathematical 
knowledge involve yet other cerebral circuits than the ones we have described in this 
chapter. In addition to quantitative and rote verbal knowledge about numbers, most 
people also have encyclopedic knowledge (e.g., knowing that 1789 is the date of the 
French Revolution) and algebraic knowledge (e.g., knowing that (a + b) 2 = a 2 + 
2ab + b2). There are good indications that encyclopedic numerical knowledge can 
remain partially preserved in Gestmann's syndrome (Dehaene & Cohen, in press) and 
in patients with extensive left-hemispheric lesions (Cohen, Dehaene, & Verstichel, 
1994). Hittmair-Delazer and her colleagues (1994, 1995) have even shown that con- 
ceptual algebraic knowledge was largely preserved in two severely acalculic patients. 
This observation suggests, against all intuition, that the neuronal circuits that hold 
algebraic knowledge must be largely independent from the networks involved in men- 
tal calculation. Their cerebral substrate, however, remains almost totally unknown.

Computational models have been used to foster insight into mechanisms of nor- 
mal and abnormal language processing in the brain. Although most of the clas- 
sical computational models have used symbolic, discrete structures to model lin- 
guistic representations and sequential, functional processing to model linguistic 
processing, the new style of connectionist modeling may assist in bridging the 
gap between descriptive models of linguistic behavior and mechanistic models of 
language processing in the brain. This chapter reviews some of the types of con- 
nectionist models and examines representative models accounting for language 
processing, as well as the deficits in such processing that can occur with brain 
injury. We will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the connectionist 
approach concerning its representational power and its adequacy in providing 
accounts for linguistic behavior in terms of neural functioning. 
Almost two decades ago, Arbib & Caplan (1979) argued that "neurolinguistics 
must be computational." They believed that computation could bring together

under one framework the opinions of several historically important neurolinguistic 
communities, including the localizationalists (Lichtheim, 1885; Geschwind, 1971), 
the holists (Jackson, 1878), and the functionalists (Head, 1926; Luria, 1973a). At 
that time, research in artificial intelligence was providing new insights into the for- 
mal representation of human knowledge (including linguistic knowledge), and ex- 
cept for some early low-level (synaptic) models by Arbib himself (Arbib, 1970), 
there was little interest in or information about parallel distributed modeling. 
Subsequent work on connectionist modeling (Ackley, Hinton, & Sejnowski, 1985; 
Dijkstra & de Smedt, 
1996; Feldman 
& Ballard, 
1982; Hopfield, 
1982; 
McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981) has brought together parallel processing aspects 
of the earlier frameworks with the representational knowledge gained through arti- 
ficial intelligence work. These results may make a computational neurolinguistics 
possible. 
While the majority of work in computational neurolinguistics considers disembod- 
ied, abstract models, connectionist (neural network) models take a more grounded 
approach to the problem. Many computational models regard cognition and language 
as being deep and difficult to study, with other functions of the brain (such as sen- 
sation, motion, and sensorimotor interfacing) considered more straightforward. At the 
very least, traditional models consider "higher" aspects of cognition wholly separate 
from low-level somatomotor and perceptual questions, so that questions of cognition 
are studied completely independently of lower brain functions. While most computer 
models attempt to explain linguistic capabilities in terms of cognitive structures, con- 
nectionist style modeling can hypothesize about neural structures underlying language 
functioning. Certain researchers have even explained neurolinguistic syndromes by 
explicitly modeling brain structures in which injury is thought to be causally related 
to the deficits found (Pulvermtiller & Preibl, 1991). By providing a modeling frame- 
work for cognition that also has been used profitably to model primary sensory and 
motor functions, connectionism has suggested some hope for bridging the gap between 
neurons and cognition. 
The ideal approach thus focuses on the interplay between computational modeling 
and the appropriate neurological and neuropsychological data, the whole couched in 
connectionist mechanisms that map naturally to what is known of the neurophysiol- 
ogical structure of the brain. Ideally, computational processes, behavioral mechanisms, 
and anatomical structures are all specified explicitly, enabling studies of performance, 
damage, and rehabilitation. 
In the remainder of this chapter, we will focus on the application of connec- 
tionist modeling techniques to the study of neurolinguistics. In particular, we will 
describe some representative network architectures and learning algorithms, and 
show how each example network has been used to explain both normal cognitive 
linguistic phenomena and the abnormal phenomena associated with acquired lan- 
guage deficits. The models thus provide theoretical sketches of aspects of the un- 
derlying neural substrates for various components of the language processing 
system.

23-1. NEURAL 
NETWORK 
MODELS 
Neural (connectionist) networks are increasingly applied to studies in cognitive neu- 
roscience (Sejnowski, Koch, & Churchland, 1988). A connectionist model consists of 
simple units of activation, which communicate by sharing their activation with other 
such units to which they are connected. Each such connection has an associated 
strength, called a weight. Units thus compute a new level of activation by combining 
their previous level of activation with the information shared with them through these 
weighted connections. Input and output of a network are provided by input units, with 
externally imposed activation levels, and output units, which contain the results of the 
network computation. All other units are referred to as hidden units of activation. The 
overall behavior of a model is determined by the pattern of connections, the weights 
on these connections, and the ways in which units compute their activation levels. 
Figure 1 shows the main features of an artificial neural network. 
The important computational features of the network are these computational units 
and the weighted connections between them. An example unit in Figure 2 shows most 
of the important features of the computing elements. The activation, or output value, 
of a unit is a numerical value associated with that unit. For each hidden or output 
unit, the new activation value is computed as some function of the activations of the

units feeding into it. First the net input is computed, which is the weighted sum of 
the activations of those units that feed into it. Second, this net input is passed through 
an activation function to compute the new activation value. While arbitrary functions 
may be used, the most common is the logistic function of Figure 3. 
There are two main aspects of a network that determine its behavior. The first 
concerns how new unit activation values are computed given some input. For example, 
the network architecture, or the pattern of connectivity between units, in part deter-

mines its computations. The units may be arranged in a sequence of layers, with 
previous layers feeding exclusively forward to subsequent layers (a feedforward ar- 
chitecture, see Figure 4), or units may be allowed bidirectional connections or other 
loops (a recurrent architecture; see Figure 5 for an example). The mechanisms deter- 
mining the specifics of network computations can be used to model particular aspects 
of language representation and processing. 
The second aspect of a neural network that determines its behavior is whether or 
not the connection weights adapt in response to environmental experience. If a net- 
work's weights do adapt, the mechanism determining how they do so is called the 
learning algorithm. Two broad classes of learning algorithms exist. In supervised 
learning, the network is presented with a training set of input/output pairs to be 
associated. The algorithm then compares the output computed by the network with 
the desired output (or the teaching signal) and calculates the difference, called the 
error of the network. This formal error measure is then used to adjust the weights so 
that subsequent presentation of the input will result in the network computing the 
proper output. In unsupervised learning, no external teaching signal is employed. 
Instead, the network is exposed to inputs, and the goal of the network is to build 
internal representations that are in some sense optimal given the input ensemble sta- 
tistics. Adaptive networks may be used to model aspects of language acquisition and 
development.

23-2. HARD-WIRED NETWORKS 
The first type of network we will examine is the hard-wired network in which the 
network structure and connection strengths are preset by the experimenter and no

network learning occurs. One example is the interactive activation model (IAM) 
(McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981). A second type of hard-wired approach is the struc- 
tured connectionist model (Feldman, Fanty, Goddard, & Lynne, 1988), an early ex- 
ample of which is a model of sentence disambiguation (Cottrell, 1985). 
The interactive activation model was first presented in McClelland and Rumelhart 
(1981). In this model, units are grouped into levels, and units within a level act as 
representational elements for various aspects of the cognitive phenomena. Connections 
may be within a level or between adjacent levels. Connections may be feedforward 
or bidirectional. The connections are hard-wired so that consistent elements of the 
network representation mutually reinforce each other (via positive, or excitatory, con- 
nections), while inconsistent elements mutually suppress one another (via negative, or 
inhibitory, connections). Thus the units cooperate or compete with each other in 
groups depending on their consistency as representations of the external environment. 
Individual units continually build up activation in time by adding their current net 
input to some decayed fraction of their previous activation value. Thus units with a 
very rapid decay rate essentially sum their net inputs from zero at each time step, 
while units with a slow decay build up their activation over time. 
The first neurolinguistic data modeled by the interactive activation model concerned 
the effects of context on letter perception (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981). The basic 
experimental finding was that letters are identified more accurately when embedded 
in the context of a word than when presented in the context of a nonword or a random 
sequence (Reicher, 1969). In their original formulation, units were grouped into levels 
corresponding to letter-feature detectors, letter detectors, and word detectors. Units 
that were consistent would reinforce one another via excitatory connections; those that 
were inconsistent would inhibit one another. 
The context effects of words on letter perception were then explained as follows. 
If a degraded letter was presented to the network in the context of a word, activation 
from all the nondegraded letters in the word drove the activation of a set of possible 
word units to a high value, which in turn suppressed all other word units not consistent 
with the current input. These activated word units then sent feedback to the letter 
units, so that only letter units consistent with the candidate word-units received pos- 
itive feedback, while inconsistent letter units received negative feedback. The com- 
bination of positive feedback from activated word units and positive activation from 
the nondegraded features of the letter drove the correct letter unit's activation above 
the incorrect letter unit's activation, thus suppressing the incorrect candidates' acti- 
vations further by the intralevel negative feedback. By this mechanism, contextual 
effects enhanced letter perception. 
Another style of modeling using hard-wired networks is the structured connectionist 
model (Feldman et al., 1988). One example used a constraint satisfaction network to 
model disambiguation phenomena (Cottrell, 1985) (Figure 6). Individual units were 
used to represent lexical items, case levels, and word senses. Compatible units were 
linked with a positive connection, incompatible ones by a negative connection. As 
lexical items entered the system and activated the corresponding lexical units, these 
sent positive activation to all senses and cases with which they were compatible. Due

to negative interactions, a coalition of units representing the proper senses and cases 
overwhelmed the incorrect units. Thus, by modeling compatible interpretations with 
positive links and incompatible ones with negative links, the system was able to 
perform the linguistic task of disambiguation in exactly the same manner as models 
of disambiguation of the two Necker cube interpretations (Feldman et al., 1988). 
A model of deep dysphasia was presented in Martin, Saffran, Dell, and Schwartz 
(1994), based on an interactive activation model of normal lexical retrieval (Dell, 
1986). Dell's model described lexical selection in production with a three-level model: 
At the top was a semantic level, which fed into a lexical level, which in turn had 
bidirectional connections with a phonemic level. The target lexical node was primed 
by the semantic representation, and in turn sent activation to its associated phonemic 
representation. Feedback reinforced the appropriate target lexical node, but also acti- 
vated phonologically related lexical competitors. Correct lexical retrieval usually oc- 
curred due to the feedback to the correct lexical item; normal speech errors occurred 
when inherent variability in the system raised phonologically related lexical compet- 
itors' activations. 
Subsequent work using this model (Martin et al., 1994) accounted for the symp- 
tomatology of the deep dysphasic patient N.C. Deep dysphasia is characterized by a 
production of semantic errors in repetition, combined with an inability to repeat 
non-words. N.C.'s behavior also included a high rate of formal paraphasias (phono- 
logically related lexical substitutions) (Martin & Saffran, 1992). The authors used the 
same model as above, with the only change being an increased decay rate. Initial 
priming of target lexical nodes by the semantic level led to activation of the phono- 
logical level, which fed back to target lexical items and competitors. However, due to 
the quicker decay rate, the initially primed target lexical node would decay back to 
normal. Thus the advantage of the primed lexical node was lost, making phonologi- 

23 
Computational Models 
351 
cally related errors more likely. The semantic errors in repetition were similarly ex- 
plained by having activation originate in the phonological nodes. Finally, the rapid 
decay of phonological nodes accounted for the inability to repeat nonwords. By pos- 
iting a pathologically high decay rate, the model accounted for deep dysphasic im- 
pairments. 
23-3. SUPERVISED 
LEARNING 
NETWORKS 
In contrast to hard-wired networks, several network paradigms exist in which connec- 
tion strengths adapt in response to environmental experience. Such models may be used 
to investigate developmental aspects of language acquisition. In addition, the emergent 
representations that develop due to certain network learning rules can be nontrivial, and 
add interesting insights to putative linguistic coding mechanisms in the brain. 
As described earlier, supervised learning utilizes a teaching signal to generate an 
error function with which to train the network. One example of this type of algorithm, 
the Boltzmann Machine (Ackley et al., 1985), uses stochastic units, and the network 
learns to reproduce the input data's probability distribution. The most widely used 
algorithm, however, is backpropagation of error, or backprop (Rumelhart, Hinton, & 
Williams, 1986). In the algorithm, the network starts with random initial weights, and 
compares its output from a given input with the teaching signal. Backprop uses gra- 
dient descent to alter the weights so as to traverse this error surface. It changes the 
weights so as to move in the direction of steepest descent (or "downhill"), and stops 
once the weights have settled to a local minimum of the error. At this point, the 
algorithm is said to have converged. The main problem with backprop, as with any 
hill-climbing algorithm, involves these local minima. Since the algorithm always 
moves downhill on the error surface, the weights are driven to whatever local mini- 
mum happens to be in a direct path from the random initial starting conditions. At 
this local minimum, the error may still be unacceptably high, while there might exist 
some other, lower-lying minima. The only way to reach these is to reinitialize the 
weights and run the algorithm again. Much current research involves modifying "va- 
nilla" backprop or devising completely new algorithms to overcome the problem of 
local minima. 
This section will examine examples of supervised learning. The first is a model of 
word recognition and naming implemented as a backprop model (Seidenberg & 
McClelland, 1989). In the second, a connectionist account of category-specific se- 
mantic deficits is presented (Small, Hart, Nguyen, & Gordon, 1995). The next ex- 
amples will examine recurrent networks, in which arbitrary connectivity is permitted. 
We will first look at a recurrent network that encodes temporal contingencies con- 
cerning sentence structure (Elman, 1991). Finally, a fully recurrent network is used 
to explain deep dyslexia (Hinton & Shallice, 1991). 
23-3.1. Feedforward Architecture 
To model word recognition and naming, Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) con- 
structed a parallel distributed processing model of the mechanisms by which ortho- 

352 
Anthony E. Harris and Steven L. Small 
graphic representations are mapped to phonological ones. The model provides putative 
mechanisms for the two major aspects of acquisition of word-recognition skills. The 
first aspect that must be learned is spelling/sound correspondences, or the systematic 
correspondences between the written and spoken forms of language. The second aspect 
concerns the distribution of letter patterns in the lexicon, or the distribution of per- 
missible letter combinations making up the written words in the language. One key 
feature of each of these aspects of word recognition is their inconsistency. The spell- 
ing/sound correspondences are not always followed, and the cues as to phonological, 
syllabic, and semantic information contained in the orthographic representations are 
not always reliable. Such a system is termed quasi-regular, where the relations among 
entities are statistical rather than categorical. Hence, connectionist models, which can 
encode statistical relations between representational units in its connection strengths, 
are particularly appropriate for investigating the word-recognition domain. 
Several supervised learning models have examined issues of abnormal development 
and effects of brain damage on normal adults (Brown, in press). In one example, 
Small et al. (1995) presented a model accounting for category-specific naming deficits 
without assuming explicit categorical knowledge in the brain. Category-specific losses 
of semantic memory generally arise after temporal lobe damage (Hart & Gordon, 
1992), and have involved selective loss of categories such as concrete objects, inan- 
imate objects, animate objects, animals, and fruits and vegetables (Hart, Berndt, & 
Caramazza, 1985; Hart & Gordon, 1992; Sartori & Job, 1988; Warrington, 1981a; 
Warrington & McCarthy, 1983; Warrington & Shallice, 1984a). In normals, processing 
of superordinate categorical information can be slower than for object-level infor- 
mation (Collins & Quillian, 1969). A common account of these findings is that cat- 
egorical information is explicitly encoded in the brain, with the agnosias corresponding 
to loss of this information. However, cortical imaging studies and direct cortical stim- 
ulation studies have met with difficulty in finding explicit, localized categorical in- 
formation (Gordon et al., 1990; Ojemann, Ojemann, Lettich, & Berger, 1989; Small, 
Noll, Perfetti, Xu, & Schneider, 1994). The authors presented an alternative formu- 
lation, in which distributed categorical information was coded implicitly in featural 
information. A feedforward backprop net was trained to match input feature vectors 
with objects on its outputs. After training, the input feature space and the emergent 
hidden unit representations were analyzed. They found that the input feature vectors 
implicitly contained categorical information, due to the statistical structure found in 
natural clustering of features. In addition, using principal components analysis on the 
hidden unit representations, it was found that many of the higher principal components 
encoded for intuitive categories. The result of the study was to demonstrate that cat- 
egorical information could exist in a distributed fashion without explicit encoding, in 
contrast to standard information processing accounts. 
23-3.2. Recurrent Architecture 
While the previous models were essentially feedforward, with a unidirectional flow 
of information, we now turn to models in which the direction of information is un- 

23 
Computational Models 
35 3 
constrained. We will examine two particular models: the simple recurrent network 
(SRN) (Elman, 1991) and a more fully recurrent attractor network (Hinton & Shallice, 
1991). 
The SRN consists of a three-layer, feedforward backprop network, with the hidden 
units copied back to a set of context units at each time step (see Figure 5). These 
context units are combined with the current input for the net input to the hidden units 
at each time step, and the net is trained with backprop. But due to the context units, 
which encode information at each time step about the previous time step, temporal 
contingencies may be represented, in order to address issues of sequential processing 
of stimuli. In Elman (1991), the author used this architecture to map each sentence 
in a training corpus onto a time-shifted copy of itself. Representations reflecting lexical 
categories were found in the analysis of the emergent hidden unit representation, due 
to the information implicit in the sequential ordering of the inputs. The network could 
also predict the next word in spite of a training corpus of sentences in which subjects 
and verbs could be separated by arbitrary numbers of embedded clauses, predicting 
proper subject-verb agreement and argument structure for verbs. Thus the network 
developed representations reflecting constituent structure, argument structure, gram- 
matical category, grammatical relations, and number. The same SRN architecture was 
used to perform lexical ambiguity resolution by encoding and then using contextual 
information (Small, 1990). 
A second model using a recurrent network was presented in Hinton and Shallice 
(1991). In this model, bidirectional connections are permitted, and activation is passed 
between units until the network settles into a stable state, or attractor. Each attractor 
has a basin of attraction around it, so that if the network is begun in any pattern of 
activation within that basin, the network state will move to the attractor. Thus the 
network can retrieve content-addressable memories and deal with degraded input, that 
is, if the net is begun in a noise-corrupted pattern, the network will "clean up" its 
input to reach the attractor stored in its memory. In this study, the net was used to 
model aspects of deep dyslexia, a syndrome in which patients seem to obtain the 
phonological representation of a written word via its semantics. This results in frequent 
semantic paraphasias (semantically related lexical substitutions). These patients also 
exhibit many visual errors, and in fact show more mixed errors (both semantic and 
visual) than would be expected by chance. The authors used a network in which 
grapheme units were mapped to recurrently connected sememe units (representing 
features). Thus each featural semantic encoding had a basin of attraction around it. If 
the network was begun near a semantic memory, the net converged to the stored 
attractor. Errors in deep dyslexics were explained as follows: Due to damage, input 
orthographic representations were mapped to semantic representations near the target. 
Thus damage can cause visual input to be mapped to semantically related output. To 
account for the visual and mixed errors, the idea is that connectionist networks tend 
to map similar input encodings to similar output encodings. The damaged net was 
likely to map nearby orthographic patterns to nearby semantic patterns, resulting in a 
mixed error. Thus damage that moves the basins of attraction in semantic space can 
cause visual or mixed errors.

23-4. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING NETWORKS 
In the second broad class of learning algorithms, unsupervised learning, no teacher is 
present for the network. An example of this approach was presented earlier in the 
discussion of competitive learning of a space of semantic features (Small et al., 1995). 
In unsupervised learning, the network learns to compute representations that are in 
some sense optimal based purely on the statistical structure of the inputs. Several 
unsupervised learning algorithms exist, one of which, the Kohonen network (Kohonen, 
1982), will be considered here. 
In the Kohonen net, the network learns a topological mapping such that similar 
inputs in the high-dimensional input space are mapped onto nearby units in the phys- 
ically two-dimensional layout of the output space. Inputs are presented one at a time, 
and the output unit with the largest net input, or the "winner," is computed. Then the 
weights to the winner are shifted toward the current input by a small amount, so that 
on subsequent presentation of a similar pattern, this unit will respond even more 
strongly. In addition to the winner shifting its weight, all the units in a local spatial 
neighborhood around the winner also shift their weights closer. Thus, units that are 
spatially contiguous come to represent similar inputs. The network becomes a topo- 
graphic map, where similar inputs are mapped to nearby outputs. 
A recent model of the lexical system, called DYSLEX, was presented using mod- 
ular, topographic maps (Miikulainen, in press). In this model, orthographic, phono- 
logic, and semantic input and output lexicons were modeled with separate, modular 
topographic maps. Each unit stood for a lexical entry. The maps were trained with 
distributed feature vectors that encode similarities between entries, and through the 
learning process these feature vectors were mapped onto nearby units in the appro- 
priate lexicon. Each of these modules was then associated with each other with weights 
that were learned by a Hebbian learning rule. In such a rule, units with strong cor- 
relations (i.e., that tend to co-occur) form strong connections, while units with anti- 
correlations form small or even strong inhibitory connections with each other. Through 
this means, orthographic and phonologic input lexical items were mapped to their 
appropriate semantic lexical items. Because nearby units encode for related items, 
noisy inputs or connection strengths made it likely for related items to be accessed. 
Combinations of errors are also possible. Thus an orthographic input could propagate 
to a visually related word, which could in turn propagate to a semantically related 
word. By combining modular connectionist substructures in a biologically plausible 
system, the model suggests an account for several observed linguistic deficits. 
23-5. SUMMARY 
Neurolinguistics has had a substantial history of computational modeling. Most tra- 
ditional models have used static, symbolic data structures on which functions act to 
produce linguistic output. An alternative paradigm, the connectionist approach, uses 
graded, dynamic representations that are processed by simple mechanisms. It has pro- 

23 
Computational Models 
355 
vided sufficient accounts of high-level behaviors using distributed networks of simple 
processing units. 
While providing demonstrations of higher-level cognitive capacities, connectionist 
models have also been used to model aspects of primary motor and sensory systems. 
Thus, by providing a single framework, they have given some insight into how func- 
tional cognitive capacities may arise from neural hardware. Although connectionist 
models have had much success, there are still several problems in bridging the gap 
between cognition and brain. Although connectionist units are "neuron-like" ele- 
ments, they are still abstract entities that only approximate real neurons. For example, 
although the activation levels are often taken to represent the average firing rate of a 
small group of real neurons, it may be that the temporal characteristics of neuronal 
spike trains encode information, which would make a single real activation value 
insufficient to model real neurons' representations. In addition, connectionist models 
still show some deficiency in moving "up a level" to the computational capacities of 
symbolic models. In particular, issues such as generativity, systematicity, and produc- 
tivity are all rather awkwardly handled by connectionist models (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 
1988). However, recent work in addressing the binding problem (Mozer, Zemel, Behr- 
mann, & Williams, 1992; Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993) may help connectionist mod- 
els overcome these shortcomings. 
The main features of connectionist networks are multiple, simple processing units 
computing in parallel. Different types of networks include hard-wired networks and 
adaptive networks, in which connection strengths automatically adjust in response to 
the environment. Another breakdown can be made on the direction of information 
flow, with either feedforward or recurrent architectures. Finally, adaptive networks 
can be characterized according to the type of learning they perform. One class is 
supervised networks, in which an explicit teaching signal is used to map inputs to 
outputs. Another is unsupervised learning, in which no teacher is present, and the 
network learns interesting representations based purely on the statistics of the inputs. 
In addition to providing plausible models of normal linguistic functions, these mod- 
els have provided accounts for linguistic deficits. Models of deep dysphasia, deep 
dyslexia, developmental dyslexia, and category-specific aphasias have been presented, 
as well as others. In all of these, accounts of complicated syndromes have been pre- 
sented without invoking simultaneous damage to modular subsystems. The ability of 
connectionist models to suggest parsimonious accounts provides support for these 
models. 
Although connectionist models cannot currently account for all aspects of higher- 
level cognition, they have accounted for many features of language processing. They 
have done so while maintaining a link to how real structures in the brain behave. 
Although these models are not strictly biologically plausible, they have suggested 
means by which neural structures may compute cognitive functions.

CHAPTER 24 
Brain Lateralization across 
the Life Span 
Merrill Hiscock 
Department of Psychology, University of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204 
Functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres in humans may develop 
gradually in childhood, reach a zenith sometime in adulthood, and undergo fur- 
ther change in senescence. Or brain lateralization may be established prior to 
birth and remain invariant throughout life, despite the effects of maturation, 
experience, and disease. This chapter summarizes evidence from various sources 
regarding the developmental course of lateralization in infancy and childhood as 
well as in normal and pathological aging. Major issues are identified, and guide- 
lines for interpreting findings are suggested. Although the question of life-span 
change versus invariance cannot be answered definitively without attaining a 
much better understanding of the functions and processes that are thought to be 
lateralized, and how they change over time, the existing evidence favors the hy- 
pothesis of invariant lateralization. 
The ontogeny of hemispheric specialization has been a prominent topic in neurology, 
neuropsychology, and neurolinguistics for many years. The idea of a gradually develop- 
ing lateralization of function (Lenneberg, 1967) is appealing, perhaps because it lends 
credibility to the assumption that hemispheric specialization is associated with behavioral 
complexity and behavioral refinement (Hiscock & Kinsbourne, 1994). Accordingly, full 
lateralization of brain functions, along with full realization of behavioral potential, would 
be attained only in adulthood (Luria, 1973b) and perhaps even late in adulthood (Brown

Merrill Hiscock 
& Jaffe, 1975). The same assumption may motivate attempts to show that humans are 
more completely lateralized than nonhumans (cf. Glick, 1985), and that socially or aca- 
demically advantaged humans are more completely lateralized than disadvantaged 
humans (e.g., Boliek & Obrzut, 1994; Geffner & Hochberg, 1971; McGlone, 1980). 
Another implication of the putative connection between lateralization and behav- 
ioral excellence concerns aging in humans, namely, the possibility that diminution of 
cognitive abilities in the aged is accompanied by hemisphere-specific cerebral degen- 
eration, or at least by more rapid deterioration of one hemisphere than of the other 
(Klisz, 1978). Thus, the optimal specialization of the hemispheres, which is realized 
at the beginning of adulthood or sometime thereafter, would be altered by unequal 
deterioration of the hemispheres during senescence. 
Empirical data thus far have provided little support for the hypothesis of gradually 
developing lateralization (nor for a systematic progression of lateralization across spe- 
cies or differences between advantaged and disadvantaged groups). There is even less 
evidence of a general tendency for one cerebral hemisphere to deteriorate more rapidly 
than the other in dementia or normal aging. 
24-1. EVIDENCE REGARDING 
DEVELOPMENTAL 
CHANGES 
24-1.1. Brain Morphology 
24-1.1.1. Asymmetries in the Immature Brain 
The relevance of neuroanatomical asymmetries to functional asymmetries in either the 
immature brain or the mature brain rests on the assumption that the size of a cortical 
region reflects its adaptive significance, the complexity of its information processing, 
or some other functional attribute (Galaburda, 1994; but see Ojemann, 1983 for evi- 
dence of a negative correlation between size and function). 
Early morphological asymmetries in the human brain (Witelson, 1983) negate the 
previously held belief that the two cerebral hemispheres are morphologically identical 
in infancy (see Dennis & Whitaker, 1977 for a historical review). Accordingly, without 
having to concede that size is an index of any functional characteristic, one can con- 
clude that the anatomical asymmetries that characterize the adult brain are neither 
absent nor less marked in the infant brain. The same conclusion applies to the anti- 
clockwise torque that is manifested as a wider frontal lobe on the right side and a 
greater anterior extension of the right frontal lobe, coupled with a wider posterior left 
hemisphere and a greater posterior extension of the left hemisphere. Irrespective of 
its functional significance, if any, in the adult human brain, a similar torque is observed 
in the immature human brain as well as in the ape brain (LeMay, 1984). 
24-1.1.2. Maturational Gradients 
Corballis and Morgan (1978) marshaled evidence from diverse sources to support their 
assertion that the left cerebral hemisphere develops more rapidly than the right hem- 

24 
Brain Lateralization 
359 
isphere. Although Corballis and Morgan's arguments stimulated interest in the concept 
of a lateral gradient of maturation, the left-to-right direction of the gradient was con- 
tradicted by a report that the right cerebral cortex in fact develops more rapidly than 
the left (Dooling, Chi, & Gilles, 1983). Subsequent accounts of neocortical maturation 
(e.g., Best, 1988; Geschwind & Galaburda, 1985) have accepted the premise that the 
right hemisphere matures more quickly than the left hemisphere. 
A lateral gradient, however, is but one aspect of brain development. The lateral 
axis may be less important than the other two dimensions of a three-dimensional 
Cartesian system of coordinates, that is, the neuraxis from brainstem to neocortex and 
the anterior-posterior axis (Kinsbourne & Hiscock, 1983). Found within the cerebral 
hemispheres are regional patterns in the development of myelination, in neuronal, 
dendritic, and axonal density, and in the width of the different cortical layers (Camp- 
bell & Whitaker, 1986). In an attempt to summarize all available data on the rate at 
which different brain regions mature, Best (1988) proposed a growth vector repre- 
senting the resultant of four developmental gradients: right-to-left, anterior-to- 
posterior; primary-to-secondary-to-tertiary, and basal-to-cortical. 
24-1.2. Electrophysiological Evidence 
A substantial body of evidence indicates that electrophysiological asymmetries are 
present in infancy. This evidence has been reviewed by Molfese and Betz (1988) and 
by Segalowitz and Berge (1994). 
Not all of the infant asymmetries are readily interpretable in terms of the pattern 
of hemispheric specialization thought to characterize the adult brain. For instance, the 
unilateral photic driving found in infants may reflect differential maturation of the left 
and right sides of the neonatal brain rather than functional specialization. However, 
numerous studies, particularly studies by Molfese and his colleagues (see Molfese & 
Betz, 1988), have shown consistent differences between the infant's hemispheres in 
electrophysiological responses to specific speech cues. Event-related potentials (ERPs) 
indicate bilateral, followed by right-hemispheric, responses to stimuli that differ in 
voice onset time (VOT), and left-hemispheric, followed by bilateral, responses to 
stimuli that differ in place of articulation (POA). The ERP findings for infants are 
similar to those for adults, although the bilateral response to POA occurs prior to the 
left-hemispheric response in the waveform of adults, and bilateral responses appear 
to be more localized in adults than in infants. 
24-1.3. Behavioral Evidence 
24-1.3.1. Head Turning and Postural Asymmetry 
Whether turning spontaneously or in response to stimulation, most infants turn their 
heads to the right more often than to the left. This rightward bias is one of the earliest 
behavioral asymmetries to be manifested by the neonate (Liederman, 1987), and it 
has been related statistically to parental handedness (Liederman & Kinsbourne, 1980) 
as well as to subsequent hand preferences of the infant (Coryell, 1985). 

360 
Merrill Hiscock 
When the infant is supine with the head turned to one side, the ipsilateral arm and 
foot often are extended, and the contralateral arm and foot are flexed. This asymmetric 
tonic neck reflex (ATNR) occurs in the newborn infant and persists for at least the 
first 3 months of life, but certain aspects change during that time. For instance, the 
ATNR is more evident in the legs of newborns than in their arms, whereas the opposite 
pattern is observed in infants older than 3 weeks (Liederman, 1987). In infants be- 
tween the ages of 3 and 10 weeks, head turns to the nonpreferred side are more likely 
to elicit the ATNR than are head turns to the preferred side, but this may not apply 
to neonates (Liederman, 1987). Whether the predominant direction of the ATNR pre- 
dicts subsequent handedness is a matter of dispute (Michel, 1983), although, as noted 
previously, early head turning by itself seems to bear a relationship to subsequent 
manual asymmetries. 
24-1.3.2. Motor Activity 
Studies of arm and hand preferences in infancy have yielded diverse results. The 
sizable literature on this topic is replete with unresolved conceptual and methodolog- 
ical issues and seemingly inconsistent findings (see Young, Segalowitz, Corter, & 
Trehub, 1983). Nonetheless, considerable evidence supports Liederman's (1983) con- 
tention that most infant behavior is dominated by the left hemisphere and right hand. 
For instance, it has been observed repeatedly--though not invariably--that most in- 
fants hold objects for a longer time with the right hand than with the left hand (see 
Provins, 1992 for a summary). The right hand typically is preferred over the left hand 
for a variety of target-related actions that are performed during the first 4 months of 
life (see Young, Segalowitz, Misek, Alp, & Boulet, 1983 for a review). It has been 
reported that a hand preference for unimanual manipulation of objects develops be- 
tween the ages of 5 and 7 months, and that a hand preference in tasks requiring 
bimanual manipulation develops by the age of 1 year (Ramsay, 1983). 
In a critical review of the evidence regarding motor asymmetries during infancy, 
Provins (1992) emphasized the potential importance of prenatal factors (e.g., intra- 
uterine position of the fetus) and postnatal factors (e.g., head position during feeding) 
in determining motor and postural asymmetries in the infant. Provins contended that 
the available evidence fails to establish that motor asymmetries in infancy are either 
early manifestations or precursors of later handedness. Thus, in addition to lingering 
doubts about the authenticity or generality of some of the observed asymmetries, there 
is uncertainty regarding the genesis and the implications of early motor asymmetries. 
24-1.3.3. Perception 
Studies of auditory perception provide some of the most convincing evidence of early 
functional asymmetries. This evidence has been summarized by Best (1988). An initial 
dichotic listening study with infants between the ages of 22 and 140 days (Entus, 
1977) yielded a right-ear advantage (REA) for detection of transitions between con- 
sonants (e.g.,/ma/to/da/), and a left-ear advantage (LEA) for transitions in musical 

24 
Brain Lateralization 
361 
timbre (e.g, cello to bassoon). Detection of a transition at either ear was indicated by 
an event-related dishabituation of the infant's nonnutritive sucking. Best and her col- 
leagues (see Best, 1988), using cardiac deceleration to indicate that a stimulus tran- 
sition had been detected, confirmed both the REA for speech syllables and the LEA 
for musical stimuli in infants 3 months of age and older. Although an LEA for musical 
stimuli has been found in 2-month-old infants, a corresponding REA for speech per- 
ception has not been reported in infants below the age of 3 months. 
A study based on a different behavioral method suggests that a speech-related brain 
asymmetry is present even in short-gestation infants who are not yet as mature as the 
typical newborn. Using limb movements as a measure of immaturity, Segalowitz and 
Chapman (1980) found that repeated exposure to speech, but not to music, caused a 
disproportionate reduction of right-arm tremor in infants with an average gestational 
age of 36 weeks, thus implying that speech affected the left side of the brain more 
than the right side. 
Other investigators have found that neonates turn more often to the right than to 
the left when exposed to speech sounds (Hammer, 1977; Young & Gagnon, 1990). 
MacKain, Studdert-Kennedy, Spieker, and Stern (1983) reported that 6-month-old in- 
fants detect the synchronization of visual (articulatory) and aural components of 
adults' speech, but only when the adult is positioned to the infant's right. These 
findings suggest that orientation is biased to the right side of space in the presence of 
linguistic stimuli, presumably because the left side of the infant's brain is more re- 
sponsive than the right side to speech-specific activation. This phasic asymmetry ap- 
pears to modulate the tonic left-hemisphere prepotency that biases orientation to the 
right. 
24-1.3.4. Childhood Laterality 
In a review of auditory, visual, tactual, and dual-task laterality studies involving chil- 
dren between the ages of 2 to 12 years, Hiscock (1988) found no consistent evidence 
of age-related increases in laterality. Irrespective of the modality tested or the method 
employed, cross-sectional studies typically reveal the expected asymmetries in the 
youngest children tested, and those asymmetries are comparable in magnitude to the 
asymmetries found in older children. 
Although few longitudinal studies have been published, results of those few studies 
are similar to results from the cross-sectional studies. When an age-related increase 
(or decrease) in laterality is observed, the change in laterality seems to reflect either 
the unreliability of the method or extraneous factors that covary with age. For ex- 
ample, a large-scale longitudinal study by Morris, Bakker, Satz, and Van der Vlugt 
(1984) yielded different developmental patterns of ear asymmetry for different sub- 
samples. The authors attributed this variability to a deficiency of experimental control 
that is inherent in the free-report dichotic listening method. Alternative methods, in 
which the child's attention is focused on one ear or on a single target, may reduce 
the influence of extraneous variables while introducing other sources of age-related 
change in ear asymmetry. Geffen and Wale (1979), for instance, found a larger REA 

362 
Merrill Hiscock 
in younger children than in older children on a task that required multiple rapid shifts 
of attention. Unable to reallocate attention quickly, the younger children apparently 
showed a strong REA by default. Differences in the ability to focus attention selec- 
tively also may account for age-related differences in the ability to overcome the REA 
when asked to attend to the left ear (e.g., Hugdahl & Andersson, 1986). 
Even if laterality remains invariant across the childhood years, a quantitative dif- 
ference conceivably could be found between the asymmetry of children and of adults. 
However, direct comparisons of children and adults on free-report dichotic listening 
(e.g., Schulman-Galambos, 1977) as well as selective listening tasks (e.g., Hugdahl & 
Andersson, 1986) have failed to reveal differences between groups in magnitude of 
the REA. 
24-1.4. Clinical Evidence 
The literature on childhood aphasia, hemispherectomy, and recovery of function has 
been reviewed by a number of authors (e.g., Aram & Eisele, 1992; Aram & Whitaker, 
1988; Hiscock & Kinsbourne, 1994; Kinsbourne & Hiscock, 1987; Satz & Bullard- 
Bates, 1981; Spreen, Risser, & Edgell, 1995; Woods & Teuber, 1978). Even though 
the hypothesis of progressive lateralization (Lenneberg, 1967) has drawn much of its 
support from cases of aphasia in children following right-hemispheric lesions, the 
preponderance of evidence now suggests that childhood aphasia consequent to uni- 
lateral right-hemisphere damage is as infrequent in children as in adults. 
Studies using quantitative measures of cognitive functioning following unilateral 
lesions are limited by a reliance on IQ and academic achievement tests, which con- 
stitute neither sensitive nor comprehensive measures of linguistic and visuoperceptual 
functioning. Such measures consequently are not optimal for differentiating between 
left- and right-sided lesions. Despite this handicap, several studies do show associa- 
tions between left-sided damage and verbal impairments, and between right-sided 
damage and nonverbal impairments. Some studies suggest that the selectivity of uni- 
lateral lesion effects is less marked when the damage is prenatal or perinatal than 
when it occurs later in development (cf. Woods, 1980). Nonetheless, there is ample 
evidence that unilateral brain lesions of prenatal or perinatal origin can lead to dif- 
ferential impairment of verbal and nonverbal functions, especially when those func- 
tions are assessed using methods other than IQ tests. 
The implications of hemispherectomy performed at different ages are difficult to 
specify, mainly because of extraneous factors that confound comparisons between 
hemispherectomy in children and hemispherectomy in adults (St. James-Roberts, 
1981) but also because of the inferential limitations of small-sample and single-case 
studies (Bishop, 1983). If any conclusion is justified by the available hemispherectomy 
evidence, it is that the outcome of hemispherectomy performed at different agesm 
which traditionally has been used to support the concept of left- and right-hemisphere 
equipotentialitymnow seems to suggest the opposite conclusion, namely, that 
specialization of the cerebral hemispheres is manifest early in life (Spreen et al., 
1995).

24-2. EVIDENCE REGARDING CHANGES 
ASSOCIATED 
WITH 
AGING 
24-2.1. Normal Aging 
24-2.1.1. Physiological Changes 
Autopsy studies reveal no obvious predominance of neuropathology in either the left 
or the right hemisphere of the elderly (Esiri, 1994). Studies based on positron emission 
tomography (PET scanning) report nearly identical levels of glucose metabolism in 
the left and right cerebral cortices and in the left and right basal ganglia of healthy 
elderly subjects (Duara et al., 1984). 
24-2.1.2. Behavioral Changes 
Various psychometric data, typically cross-sectional, establish that certain kinds of 
tasks are more prone than others to show age-related declines in average performance. 
For instance, it is evident from normative data that absolute scores on the Performance 
subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) decline more 
rapidly with increasing age than do scores on the Verbal subtests. The differential 
decrement of Performance and Verbal scores is confirmed by longitudinal data (Mor- 
tensen & Kleven, 1993). Similarly, tests of "fluid" intelligence--the ability to solve 
problems requiring novel information and strategiesmare more likely to show age- 
related changes than are tests of "crystallized" intelligencemthe ability to utilize 
previously acquired knowledge and strategies (Horn & Cattell, 1967). Age-related 
decline in average performance on some tests is quite marked. On Raven's Standard 
Progressive Matrices, an untimed test that contains seemingly novel problems, an 
average score for 18-year-olds falls at the 95th percentile for 65-year-olds (Lezak, 
1995). 
Psychometric data, including results from neuropsychological testing, sometimes 
have been construed as evidence that right-hemisphere functions are more vulnerable 
than left-hemisphere functions to deterioration with advancing age. This conclusion, 
however, is not supported with any consistency by findings from laterality tests. Al- 
though two dichotic listening studies (Clark & Knowles, 1973; Johnson et al., 1979) 
yielded larger right-ear advantages (REAs) in elderly people than in younger sub- 
jectsman outcome that is consistent with deterioration of the right hemisphere~the 
results are obfuscated by the use of multiple pairs of stimuli per trial. Given that 
subjects tend to report right-ear signals prior to left-ear signals, a larger REA may 
reflect nothing more than diminished overall performance. 
Two of the most salient cognitive deficits observed among the elderly are reduced 
speed of processing (Van Gorp, Satz, & Mitrushina, 1990) and reduced ability to 
perform complex or difficult tasks (Crossley & Hiscock, 1992). It is uncertain whether 
these deficits represent separate limitations~e.g., slowness of processing versus in- 
sufficiency of processing resources~or different manifestations of the same limitation 
(Salthouse, 1988). Nonetheless, since reaction time (RT) and dual-task paradigms are 

364 
Merrill Hiscoek 
known to yield consistent age effects, these two paradigms are appropriate potential 
sources of evidence regarding lateralized impairment in the elderly. Should future use 
of these paradigms yield evidence of age-related changes in laterality, care must be 
taken to ascertain that the findings reflect differential deterioration of the left and right 
hemispheres rather than changes in the functioning of the corpus callosum (Hoptman, 
Davidson, Gudmundsson, Schreiber, & Ershler, 1996). 
24-2.2. Clinical Evidence 
24-2.2.1. Dementia 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially early-onset AD, often affects object naming, 
spontaneous speech, and praxic functions (Nicholas, Obler, Albert, & Helm-Esta- 
brooks, 1985). Although one may be tempted to attribute these symptoms to predom- 
inantly left-hemispheric pathology, such symptoms simply may be more noticeable 
than deficits associated with right-hemispheric disease. Moreover, right-hemispheric 
symptoms such as spatial confusion are seen frequently in patients with AD, and 
postmortem examinations of the brain typically reveal diffuse bilateral pathology 
(Braak & Braak, 1992; Esiri, 1994; Wischik, Harrington, & Mukaetova-Ladinska, 
1994). 
Even if AD shows no general predilection for one or the other cerebral hemisphere, 
individual patients with AD sometimes exhibit a cognitive profile suggestive of left- 
or right-hemisphere dysfunction. Sometimes the cognitive profile can be related to 
regional differences in cerebral metabolism (Chawluk et al., 1990; Martin, 1990). 
Using PET to measure glucose utilization in the left and right hemispheres, Martin et 
al. (1986) found predominantly left-sided hypometabolism in four patients with rela- 
tively selective word-finding deficits and predominantly right-sided hypometabolism 
in five patients with relatively selective visuoconstructional impairment. Massman and 
Doody (1996) reported that fewer than 40% of 104 patients with AD had finger- 
tapping asymmetry scores falling within normal limits. Twenty-seven patients showed 
an exaggerated right-hand advantage, and 38 patients showed reversed asymmetry. 
The deviant subgroups differed from each other, not only in cognitive performance, 
but also in educational level. Patients with an exaggerated right-hand advantage had 
better verbal skills and more years of education than did patients with reversed asym- 
metry. Massman and Doody suggest that a relatively high level of premorbid left- 
hemisphere functioning may reduce an individual's vulnerability to the behavioral 
effects of AD. 
24-2.2.2. Aphasia 
The relative incidence of different aphasia types appears to shift as a function of age 
(Brown & Jaffe, 1975; Brown & Grober, 1983; Miceli et al., 1981; Obler, Albert, 
Goodglass, & Benson, 1978). Brown and Grober (1983) found that expressive dis- 
orders and mixed aphasias (i.e., nonfluent speech with moderately impaired compre- 
hension) predominate throughout the life span, but the preponderance of these non- 

24 
Brain Lateralization 
365 
fluent aphasias is most striking during the first 3 decades of life. The incidence of 
global aphasia begins to rise in the 4th decade, and sensory (fluent) aphasias become 
relatively common during the 7th decade. Brown and Grober attributed these age- 
related shifts to a gradually increasing degree of lateralization and focal brain organ- 
ization: an initially bilateral and diffuse language substrate becomes unilateral and 
focal over time, with expressive functions lateralizing before receptive functions. It is 
not clear, however, that the changing incidence reflects shifts in lateralization rather 
than regional changes in vulnerability to cerebral disease, changes in compensatory 
ability (i.e., in plasticity), or other variables. 
24-3. THE MAJOR ISSUES 
24-3.1. What Is Lateralized? 
As Kinsbourne (1984) has pointed out with regard to localization of function, neu- 
ropsychology has been more successful in specifying where functions are localized 
than in specifying the functions that are localized. The dichotomy between "what" 
and "where" underlies many of the most difficult questions concerning life-span de- 
velopment of hemispheric specialization. A misplaced emphasis on the question of 
"where" has led to disagreement about the lateralization of functions that are only 
vaguely defined. Porter and Berlin (1975), for instance, pointed out that some of the 
dichotic listening tasks used with children tap processes that are primarily acoustic or 
phonetic, whereas other dichotic listening tasks involve semantic and mnemonic pro- 
cessing. As a rule, however, investigators have been content to assume that a particular 
category of stimuli, such as digit names, represents a much broader and rather ill- 
defined range of linguistic material. 
Luria (1973b) addressed this problem when he emphasized that the development 
of a new perceptual or motor skill entails first consolidating isolated elements of the 
function into an integrated and automatized series of elements and then linking the 
integrated elements into a network of superordinate functions. Luria made it clear that 
lesion studies cannot reveal the localization of a mental process unless the structure 
of the process is understood. Much of the research on age-related change in functional 
lateralization violates this basic Lurian caveat: investigators have attempted to later- 
alize a function or set of functions without any independent knowledge as to how the 
functions are organized. 
24-3.2. What Do Early Electrophysiological Asymmetries Imply? 
In a longitudinal study of children from birth until the age of 3 years, Molfese and 
Molfese (1986) found that individual differences in ERP recorded in the neonate could 
predict performance on language tests 3 years later. The best predictor was a left- 
lateralized consonant-discrimination component of the neonatal ERE Yet, ironically, 
lateralized ERPs to speech cues have been recorded in dogs and rhesus monkeys, 

366 
Merrill Hiscock 
prompting Molfese and Betz (1988) to suggest that the critical difference between 
humans and nonhumans with respect to speech discrimination is reflected not by la- 
teralized ERP components but instead by bilateral components, which have been not 
been found in monkeys and dogs. 
24-3.3. Pitfalls in the Interpretation of Age-Related Change in 
Behavioral Asymmetries 
As the selective-listening method becomes more prominent in dichotic listening re- 
search, the question of age-related change in ear asymmetry during childhood is being 
resurrected in the form of a controversy concerning children's ability or inability to 
overcome the REA when asked to attend to the left ear in the presence of dichotic 
competition (see Hiscock & Beckie, 1993). The ability to attend selectively to the left 
ear may be regarded either as a skill that increases developmentally (Hugdahl & 
Andersson, 1986) or as a manifestation of deficient left-hemisphere language repre- 
sentation (Obrzut, Obrzut, Bryden, & Bartels, 1985). Unless the multiple factors that 
influence selective attention are controlled, an age-related difference in ability to over- 
come the REA does not necessarily indicate an age-related difference in hemispheric 
specialization. 
24-3.4. Does Differential Loss of Skills Imply Differential 
Deterioration of the Cerebral Hemispheres? 
The available evidence concerning cognitive changes during aging establishes only 
that certain measures--especially RT and dual-task performancemare more prone than 
others to show age-related declines in average performance. Even the widely accepted 
principle that fluid intelligence deteriorates more rapidly than crystallized intelligence 
remains open to question (Van Gorp et al., 1990). Longitudinal data reveal a marked 
variability among individuals in rate of cognitive decline (Schaie, 1993). At this time, 
inducing a general principle regarding differential decline of left- and right-hemisphere 
abilities does not appear to be feasible. 
24-4. CONCLUSIONS 
Brain functions change over the life span as a consequence of maturation, experience, 
and disease. Various sources of evidence indicate that functional changes often are 
associated with reorganization of the neural substrate. Yet, the preponderance of ev- 
idence suggests that lateralization of function generally does not change: left- 
hemispheric functions tend to remain left-hemispheric and right-hemispheric functions 
tend to remain right-hemispheric. Apparent developmental changes in lateralization 
usually can be attributed to changing plasticity, changing ability levels, or other con- 
founding variables. However, until the various functions of interest are delineated more 

24 
Brain Lateralization 
367 
clearly and measured more adequately, the developmental invariance of lateralization 
may be regarded as the most plausible hypothesis. 
24-5. FUTURE OUTLOOK 
The concept of brain lateralization is an abstraction. One may discuss the concept of 
lateralization but no one can observe lateralization per se. Only specific manifestations 
of lateralizationmhand preferences, asymmetric ERPs, aphasia symptoms following 
left- and right-sided strokes, and so forth--may be observed. Consequently, there is 
no critical experiment that will resolve the central question concerning the course of 
lateralization during the human life span. The definitive answer, if there is to be a 
definitive answer, will have to be synthesized from a multitude of studies designed to 
address more specific questions. In some instances, information about lateralization 
may be incidental to other data, for example, data describing recovery of function. 
To interpret accurately the various findings of relevance to the life-span laterali- 
zation question as they materialize, it will be necessary to respect certain distinctions. 
Among them are the following: 
1. Change in lateralization versus change in compensatory ability. It is essential to 
distinguish between decreasing bilaterality of function (evidence of which potentially 
could be found in normal children) and decreasing equipotentiality (which would be 
manifested only as differential outcomes following focal brain injury sustained at 
different ages). As pointed out by Satz, Strauss, and Whitaker (1990), failures to make 
that distinction have added confusion to the literature on childhood lateralization. The 
same problem is encountered when attempting to interpret behavioral changes at the 
other end of the life span. A developmental shift toward bilateralization of a previously 
unilateral function is different in principle from deterioration of the unilateral function. 
2. Change in laterality of activation versus rearrangement of specialized cortical 
processors. Only in the ideal case would the pattern of regional brain activation match 
precisely an individual's cortical localization scheme (Hiscock & Kinsbourne, 1987). 
If laterality of activation is distinguished from lateralized representation of various 
cortical functions (Segalowitz & Berge, 1995), it follows that age-related changes in 
one aspect of lateralization may be dissociated from changes in the other aspect. For 
example, markedly asymmetric activation in a patient with Alzheimer's disease (Mar- 
tin et al., 1986) need not imply a corresponding shift of cortical functions to the more 
activated side. 
3. Change in lateralization versus change in the microstructure of an activity. New 
components of a task may materialize as a consequence of maturation or practice, or 
existing components may become automatized. In addition, increasing proficiency 
might entail restructuring a task, as when reading is enhanced by the application of 
material-appropriate strategies. Other changes in task structuremcompensatory as well 
as deleteriousmpresumably occur in senescence. Whenever an age-related change in 
the lateralization of an activity is observed, it will be important to establish whether 

368 
Merrill Hiscoek 
that change reflects a shifting brain basis for a fixed set of task components or a 
shifting set of task components. 
4. Individual versus population-level asymmetries. If clinical evidence continues 
to support the existence of hemisphere-selective deficits in some patients with AD, it 
will be important to know whether the disease process itself is asymmetrical in those 
patients (at least, in the early stages of the disease), or whether the behavioral con- 
sequences of an invariably bilateral disease depend on certain premorbid character- 
istics of the patient. Either answer would contribute significantly to our understanding 
of Alzheimer's disease, but neither answer would support a claim that the left and 
right hemispheres~at the level of the population~are differentially vulnerable.

Language in the Right Hemisphere 
Following Callosal Disconnection

The received view is that the disconnected right hemisphere (RH) has a rich 
semantic system, limited phonology, and poor syntax. It has a large auditory 
vocabulary and a smaller reading vocabulary but little or no writing and speech. 
Further, recent studies show that when resources are taxed, word recognition in 
the disconnected RH can be sensitive to wordness, word length, word frequency, 
and word concreteness but not to regularity of grapheme-phoneme correspon- 
dence. But even though it has no assembled phonology, the disconnected RH can 
sometimes demonstrate addressed phonological access to speech. In fact some 
aphasic symptoms are attributable to RH contribution when left-hemisphere 
(LH) inhibition is removed, notably semantic paralexias in deep dyslexia, miming 
without naming in optic aphasia, and covert reading in pure alexia. Converging 
evidence suggests that language performance in the normal RH can borrow re- 
sources from the LH and can surpass the capacity of the disconnected RH, in- 
cluding some competence for grammar and for assembled phonology. Language 
performance in the disconnected RH can, in turn, borrow resources from the 
disconnected LH and can surpass the capacity of the aphasic's RH. Word rec- 
ognition in either normal hemisphere appears to progress in parallel through 
both a nonlexical and a non-lexical route and the two routes interact.

There is general consensus that the capacity for human language is innate and wired 
into the left cerebral hemisphere (LH) of most right-handed adults. Then why study 
language in the right hemisphere (RH)? Because RH language offers a unique 
perspective on the nativist position about the innateness and modularity of natural 
language by demonstrating the range of language ablilities that can be supported by 
a more general cognitive system that learns language by experience. Why then study 
language in the disconnected RH instead of studying residual language in aphasia? 
Because language in the disconnected RH following complete cerebral commissur- 
otomy permits assessment of positive language competence, presumably free of cal- 
losally mediated inhibitory effects of left aphasiogenic lesions. But isn't language in 
the disconnected RH atypical, reflecting reorganization due to early epileptogenic le- 
sions? We find no evidence, either developmental, using clinical observation prior to 
disconnection, or late, following surgery, using behavioral lateralized testing, for lan- 
guage reorganization in the RH due to early epileptogenic lesions in our key split- 
brain patients from the Los Angeles series. 
25-1. DISCONNECTION 
SYNDROME 
Right-handed patients who had a single-stage complete cerebral commissurotomy, 
including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and hippocampal commissure, 
demonstrate a loss of normal communication between the two cerebral hemispheres. 
They cannot compare stimuli across the midline, and they cannot verbally identify 
objects palpated out of view by the left hand or pictures flashed briefly in the left 
visual hemifield (LVF). At the same time, these patients demonstrate nonverbally good 
perception and awareness of the meaning of stimuli restricted to the RH, by appro- 
priate manipulation of the stimuli and reliable retrieval from a collection. Within a 
few months after the operation, patients appear normal in casual social situations. 
They perform normally in clinical language tests although they tend to exhibit some 
pragmatic deficits in conversation, including inappropriate or exaggerated politeness, 
an occasional tendency to confabulate, and alexithymia, an impoverished verbal de- 
scription of strong emotional personal experiences (Bogen, 1993). The patients fail to 
sustain reading of extended texts and do not read for enjoyment. 
25-2. SYNOPSIS 
OF EARLIER 
FINDINGS 
In order to compare linguistic performance across tests, patients, and hemispheres, 
developmental age norms on standardized tests for language acquisition can be used. 
The resulting profile does not correspond uniformly to any stage in the ontogenesis 
of first language (Zaidel, 1990). This means that the RH is not arrested uniformly at 
some stage of language development when LH specialization starts developing. 
The disconnected RHs of patients in the Los Angeles series have substantial au- 
ditory language comprehension, more limited reading, little or no spontaneous speech, 

25 
Language in the Right Hemisphere 
371 
and no writing. Comprehension of sentences is restricted to short phrases. The dis- 
connected RH has a severely limited short-term verbal memory of 3 + 1 items, as 
against 7 _+ 2 in the disconnected LH or in the normal brain. 
The RH can read words in different sizes, cases, and typefaces (Zaidel, 1982). It 
reads concrete content words better than abstract function words and it cannot translate 
graphemes into phonemes (Zaidel & Peters, 1981). Reading comprehension in the 
disconnected RH, whether for words or for phrases, is consistently worse than auditory 
comprehension, and the reading lexicon is a proper subpart of the auditory lexicon. 
Unlike LB and NG, the RHs of JW and DR from the Hanover series are said to 
possess equal auditory and visual lexicons (Tramo et al., 1995). 
The disconnected RHs of four patients with complete commissurotomy from the 
Los Angeles series (LB, NG, RY and AA) could all perform above chance lateralized 
lexical decision of concrete nouns and of orthographically regular nonwords (Zaidel, 
1983). Other studies confirm that there is receptive language competence in the dis- 
connected RHs of all six patients from the California series who were tested regularly 
at Caltech. Those studies include auditory language comprehension by AA (Nebes & 
Sperry, 1971), execution of verbal commands by RY (Gordon, 1980), phonological 
encoding in CC (Levy & Trevarthen, 1977), lexical auditory comprehension and read- 
ing in NG, LB, AA, and RY (Hamilton, Nargeot, Vermeire, & Bogen, 1986), and 
auditory comprehension in NW (Bogen, 1979). Similar abilities have been demon- 
strated by the RHs of four commissurotomy patients from the Hanover (PS, JW, DR) 
and Toledo (VP) series (Baynes, Tramo, & Gazzaniga, 1992). 
The disconnected RH has a rich lexical and pictorial semantics. It recognizes lin- 
guistic and nonlinguistic references to people and events and it has access to episodic 
(personal) and semantic knowledge (about the world). It can comprehend not only 
nouns, verbs, and adjectives but also a variety of grammatical and some simple syn- 
tactic structures, ranging from functors and tense markers to transformations such as 
the passive or the negative. There follows a summary of findings since 1990. 
25-3. WORD RECOGNITION 
IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE 
25-3.1. Dual-Route Analysis 
The dual-route model of naming printed words distinguishes (a) a Visual Analysis 
System that determines the identity and position of each letter in the input string and 
assigns the letter an abstract representation that is visually invariant; (b) a lexical 
route that (i) locates an entry for the word in a Visual Input Lexicon and from it (ii) 
accesses the appropriate part of the Semantic System; the entry in the Semantic Sys- 
tem, in turn, (iii) provides (addresses) an Output Phonological Representation for the 
word, which is next translated into (iv) an Articulatory Program and subsequently 
leads to (v) Speech; (c) a parallel nonlexical route that (i) Translates Graphemes into 
Phonemes and thereby provides (ii) an assembled Output Phonological Representation 

372 
Eran Zaidel 
for the word (e.g., Patterson, Marshall, & Coltheart, 1986). The Visual Analysis Sys- 
tem may be characterized by a length effect when resources are taxed. This effect is 
therefore common to both routes. However, the nonlexical route should be particularly 
sensitive to string length, relative to the lexical route. By definition, the lexical route 
should show a strong wordness effect, with a selective advantage for processing words, 
whereas the nonlexical route can process words and nonwords equally. The lexical 
route is characterized by a frequency effect, and the nonlexical route is characterized 
by an orthographic regularity effect. Finally, it is believed that the lexical route is 
faster than the nonlexical route so that it wins in a horse race. It is also supposed that 
dual-route variable effects (length, wordness, frequency, regularity) are mandatory 
rather than merely possible. 
The hemispheric version of the dual-route model proposes (a) that each hemisphere 
can store abstract letter identities, (b) that each hemisphere has access to "its own" 
lexical route, but (c) that only the LH has access to a nonlexical route. Assume that 
the two routes operate in parallel without interacting in the LH, and that the lexical 
route is faster than the nonlexical route. Suppose also that word recognition in the 
two (normal) hemispheres proceeds in parallel, without interactions. Then word rec- 
ognition in both VFs should show the effects of a lexical route. This predicts that a 
lateralized word-recognition or naming experiment should show length effects in both 
VFs, a frequency effect in both VFs, and no regularity effect in either VE We have 
carried out two lateralized lexical decision experiments with LB and with normal 
controls to test these predictions. Previous experiments had found that the auditory 
vocabularies of both disconnected hemispheres of LB and NG show similar frequency 
effects (Zaidel, 1978b), that both hemispheres of LB and NG as well as of normals 
show concreteness effects (Eviatar, Menn, & Zaidel, 1990), and that the disconnected 
RH cannot match words with different end spellings for rhyming, that is, that it has 
no grapheme-phoneme translation and thus no assembled phonology (Zaidel & Peters, 
1981). More recently, Eviatar and Zaidel (1994) showed that, in general, both hemi- 
spheres of NG, LB, and AA from the Los Angeles series could match letters for both 
shape and name (Posner-Mitchell paradigm). 
The results of two lexical decision experiments with LB and with normal controls 
are shown in Table 1. Also shown are the results of a similar experiment with con- 
genital phonological dyslexics and with normal children, as well as with deep dyslexia 
patient RW (see Section 25-5.3). The results do not support either the assumptions or 
the predictions of the hemispheric dual-route model. First, it is clear that all effects 
(length, wordness, frequency, and regularity) are possible but none is necessary in any 
condition. This suggests that an effect occurs in a particular condition only when 
resources are limited (cf. Eviatar & Zaidel, 1991 concerning length effects). Second, 
regularity effects do occur in both VFs, suggesting (a) that the two routes interact, 
and (b) that the RH has access to a nonlexical route! Third, the prediction that length 
effects are stronger in the LH because they reflect selectively the contribution of the 
nonlexical route, which is active predominantly in the LH, is not supported. Rather, 
length effects can occur either for words or for nonwords in either VE However, if 
they occur for words, then they also occur for nonwords, and if they occur in the

RVE then they also occur in the LVE This ordering presumably reflects the order of 
hemispheric competencies and thus resource availability for the particular function 
(lexical decision). Fourth, dyslexic children with phonological difficulties show some 
evidence for ambiguous laterality: there is a selective wordness effect, indexing the 
lexical route, in the RVE and there is a regularity effect, indexing the nonlexical route, 
in both VFs. 
25-3.2. Right-Hemisphere Speech? 
Patient LB from the Los Angeles series has consistently been able to name some 
pictures and words in the LVF without being able to do same-different matching of 
the same stimuli across the two VFs (e.g., Johnson, 1984). This could reflect (a) RH 
speech through addressed rather than assembled phonology. Alternatively, it need not 
reflect RH speech but could rather reflect (b) cross-cuing between the perceiving RH 
and the verbalizing LH, especially when the choice set is small and overlearned. LB 
often uses a verbal cross-cuing strategy where the LH seems to guess in turn each 
letter making up the name of the stimulus by going through the alphabet with the PH 
apparently signaling when the correct one is reached (D.W. Zaidel, 1988). LVF naming 
could also reflect (c) subcallosal phonological and semantic but not visual transfer 
from the RH to the LH. Finally, LVF naming can reflect (d) ipsilateral projection of 
sensory information from the LVF to the LH, say, via the extrageniculo-striate system 
(retina ~ R superior colliculus ~ intercollicular commissure --~ L superior colliculus 
--~ LH), although that system is believed to mediate perception without verbal aware- 
ness, as in blind sight, rather than verbal identification without perception (same- 
different matching), as observed here. 
25-3.2.1. Patient JW 
Baynes, Wessinger, Fendrich, and Gazzaniga (1995) observed similar partial naming 
of LVF stimuli in callosotomy patient JW from the Hanover series. He could name 
about 25% of stabilized pictures and words shown in the LVF but naming was sen- 
sitive to the perceptual quality of the stimuli. This is consistent with superior-collicular 
mediation of projecting LVF stimuli to the LH because changes in the perceptual 
quality of the stimuli (e.g., contrast, eccentricity) may be expected to affect ipsilateral 
projection more than cross-cuing or subcallosal transfer. There were similar error pat- 
terns in the LVF and RVF and this may argue against RH speech, assuming different 
lexical organizations in JW's two hemispheres. An ingenious attempt to exclude RH- 
to-LH cross-cuing, by demonstrating naming of an unexpected digit in the LVE failed, 
and the error pattern suggested cross-cuing in LVF digit naming. Another ingenious 
manipulation involved naming of "secret stimuli": "Any time you see an 'X' (where 
X appears lateralized to the LVF or to the RVF) say 'Y'." The results were ambiguous 
due to small numbers of trials and low sensitivities (signal detection d'). In sum, the 
data of Baynes et al. do not strongly support RH speech and are equally consistent 
with subcallosal transfer. 

25 
Language in the Right Hemisphere 
375 
25-3.2.2. Patient LB 
We examined LB's ability to name LVF words as a function of the presence and type 
of distractors in the RVE We reasoned that if his LH controlled LVF naming, then 
LVF naming performance should drop when the LH is simultaneously occupied by a 
distractor in the RVE Further, the drop should be greater for word than for figural 
distractors because then the distractor would engage more of the resources necessary 
for naming the LVF stimulus. Conversely, if LB's RH controlled LVF naming, then 
the presence of distractors in the RVF should have no effect or it could even improve 
LVF naming by removing LH inhibition. 
In one experiment, we presented two lists of 96 LVF words each, half with and 
half without graphic distractors, consisting of nonsense geometric shapes, in the RVE 
The first list showed significantly better prompt and correct naming of LVF words 
without distractors (33.3%) than with distractors (20.8%) (Figure 1). This pattern is 
consistent with LH naming of LVF words. The second list, however, showed no 
difference between naming of LVF words with (40%) and without (35%) distractors. 
This could mean that the LH has enough resources to name the LVF words inspite 
of the RVF distractors, but the data are more consistent with RH speech. 
In another experiment, we presented 12 lists of 96 words each. Half of each list 
consisted of target words (underlined) in the LVF and half of targets in the RVE Half 
of the targets were unilateral and half had distractors in the other VE Half of the 
distractors were words and half were nonwords. This experiment was administered 
twice, 4 months apart. In the first administration, there was no difference in prompt 
and correct naming of LVF targets with (33%) and without (32%) distractors (Figure 
1). Again, this could mean that the LH has enough resources to name LVF targets

without interference from verbal distractors in the RVE In that case, LH resources 
must fluctuate widely so that it is sometimes not affected by verbal distractors and 
other times it is affected by nonverbal distractors. This is unlikely. The observed 
pattern is more consistent with RH naming of LVF targets. In the second administra- 
tion of the experiment, there was significantly better naming of LVF targets without 
(43%) than with (27%) distractors (F (1,11) = 25.4, p = .0004). This supports the 
LH naming hypothesis. Furthermore, both administrations disclosed a frequency effect 
but only the second administration disclosed a regularity effect. This is consistent with 
the observation that LB's disconnected LH has access to a nonlexical route whereas 
his RH does not (Zaidel, 1990). 
In sum, there is a great variability in LB's LVF naming strategies both within and 
between sessions. Naming of LVF stimuli frequently fails. When it succeeds it some- 
times reflects LH naming via cross-cuing, ipsilateral sensory projection, and subcal- 
losal cognitive transfer. On other occasions it does appear to reflect RH naming. 
25-3.3. Dynamic Language Competence in the Partially Disconnected 
Right Hemisphere 
Faure and Blanc-Garin (1994) describe a provocative case of a patient with a left 
fronto-occipital white matter lesion sparing the cortex and with a posterior (half) 
callosal lesion, resulting in temporary global aphasia and a persistent disconnection 
syndrome. Hemifield tachistoscopic semantic decisions (Is this word an animal name?) 
following language recovery disclosed good performance in the RVF but chance per- 
formance in the LVE However, LVF performance improved (a) with prior RH priming 
and (b) with concurrent LH loading. RH priming was accomplished by requiring the 
patient to solve silently a maze presented centrally in free vision and point to the 
solution with the left hand before each lateralized trial in the semantic decision task. 
LH overloading was accomplished by requiring the patient to remember up to four 
words presented centrally before each lateralized trial in the semantic decision task 
and to recall it after the trial was completed. This was assumed to release LH inhibition 
of RH competence. The authors concluded that the linguistic performance of the RH 
varies with the balance of interhemispheric activation. However, the roles of prior 
aphasia and of partial callosal section in these results remain unclear. The authors 
suggest that smaller fluctuations can be expected in normal subjects because their 
balance of interhemispheric activation is more even. Thus, posterior callosal section 
is assumed to be responsible for disrupting the normal balance. 
We failed to show comparable priming or removal of inhibition of lateralized lex- 
ical decision in the LVF in either the normal or commissurotomized brains by in- 
cluding letter string distractors in the nontargeted VE Instead, normals showed a loss 
due to the presentation of distractors and the loss was greater for LVF targets (Iacoboni 
& Zaidel, 1996). By contrast, LB showed no loss or benefit due to distractors. Taken 
together, this suggests (a) that the anterior callosum mediates inhibitory channels that 
can be modulated by attention, and (b) that posterior channels permit the LH to au- 
tomatically share resources with the normal (and independent) RH.

25-4. INTERHEMISPHERIC RELATIONS 
25-4.1. Explicit Transfer: A Double Dissociation 
The two classical symptoms of the disconnection syndrome, namely, LVF anomia and 
failure of cross integration across the midline, can show double dissociation in the 
chronic condition. On the one hand, LB can name some LVF pictures, letters, or 
words without being able to make same-different judgments about the same stim- 
uli across the vertical meridian. On the other hand, NG can make accurate same- 
different judgments about visual stimuli in the two visual hemifields, without being 
able to name the same stimuli in the LVE This double dissociation between perceptual 
integration and verbal awareness can serve as an anatomical model of a double dis- 
sociation between implicit and explicit knowledge. RH speech in LB does not present 
a challenge to the disconnection account, but the alternative, semantic transfer, in the 
absence of sensory transfer, demonstrates that consciousness can be based on higher 
stimulus codes without access to lower codes. 
Thus, whereas LB could match letters for shape and name in either VE he could 
not match for either shape or name across the vertical meridian (Eviatar & Zaidel, 
1994). By contrast, NG could not only match by shape and name in either VF but 
she could also match by shape, though not by name, across the two VFs (Eviatar & 
Zaidel, 1994). (Both LB and NG showed RH superiority for shape matches and LH 
superiority for name matches.) In fact, NG could match meaningless geometric shapes 
with poor association value between the disconnected hemispheres (cf. Zaidel, 1994). 
This makes it unlikely that she matches high-level semantic subcallosal codes, and 
suggests instead that she transfers a low-level visual representation sufficient for same- 
different matching but not for conscious identification. The transfer is presumably 
mediated by the extrageniculo-striate pathway, retina ~ superior colliculus ~ pulvinar 
extrastriate cortex. Finally, in a control condition for a lateralized Stroop experi- 
ment, NG was (barely) able to match colors across the two VFs but she could not 
name LVF colors. In contrast, LB could not match colors across the two VFs but he 
could name LVF color patches (Zaidel, 1994). Thus, NG and LB may show selective 
subcallosal transfer, suggesting that the two patients differ from each other in the 
channels that are available for transfer. A verbal version of the Stroop experiment 
with spatially separate color patches and color words, in the same or opposite VE 
showed good naming of LVF patches by LB, sometimes consistent with RH naming 
and other times with LH naming (sensitivity to the color word in the RVF). 
Intriligator, Hanaff, and Michel (1995) reported a pattern similar to LB in AC, 
a patient who had a lesion of the posterior third of his corpus callosum. He could 
name or identify verbally unilateral or bilateral stimuli in both VFs, ranging in com- 
plexity from sine wave gratings to faces and objects. He could not, however, compare 
(same/different) the same stimuli across the vertical meridian, although he could com- 
pare them within either VE This implies that interhemispheric transfer for visual com- 
parisons and for naming is carried out by different callosal channels, the former more 
posterior than the latter. Both of these channels appear to have subcallosal analogues.

Visual subcallosal transfer is better developed in NG, whereas linguistic subcallosal 
transfer may be better developed in LB. 
Sergent (1987) found that LB and NG could decide whether four-letter strings 
straddling the midline were words or not. The stimulus set was small and although 
patients were tested for, and were shown incapable of, verbalizing the words, it was 
not clear whether either hemisphere "knew" the meaning of the word. Further, Cor- 
ballis and Trudel (1993) could not replicate this finding. 
25-4.2. Implicit Transfer 
Define interhemispheric transfer in the split brain as implicit if both verbalization of 
LVF stimuli and cross-matching on demand fail, but there is nonetheless some auto- 
matic influence of the unattended stimulus in one VF (the distractor) on a conscious 
decision of an attended stimulus in the other (the target). Given LB's and JW's ability 
to name some LVF pictures or words and NG's ability to compare shapes across the 
vertical meridian, the preconditions for implicit transfer may not be satisfied and need 
to be assessed for each task and patient on a case-by-case basis. Further, what if 
naming of an LVF word fails but another high level task, say, semantic classification, 
can be successfully applied to it? Does that indicate conscious explicit transfer or un- 
conscious, but high-level, implicit transfer? Needed is a taxonomy of tasks that de- 
marcates conscious, attentional processing from unconscious, unattentional processing. 
In any case, the canonical case for implicit priming in the split brain would require 
(a) evidence for failure of explicit transfer, (b) information about priming within each 
disconnected hemisphere, and (c) evidence for significant priming between the discon- 
nected hemispheres. We may even require converging evidence from the normal brain. 
The most common pattern would include significant, if unequal, priming in each VF 
with ipsilateral hand responses, found both in the split and the normal brains, as well as 
smaller priming effects between the hemispheres than within the hemispheres, more so 
in the split than in the normal brain. But a priming effect that occurs only between the 
hemispheres would be of special interest because it may require interhemispheric in- 
teraction. 
In an attempt to demonstrate implicit transfer in the split brain, Zaidel (1983b) 
used a lexical decision task with lateralized targets and lateralized associated primes 
but found no priming between the hemispheres. Similarly, Reuter-Lorenz and Baynes 
(1992) found no evidence for letter priming across the disconnected VFs. On the other 
hand, Lambert (1991, 1993) showed presumed negative priming of an RVF target by 
an LVF prime in a lexical categorization task both in normals and in LB. However, 
this result may have been artifactual because the targets that showed inhibition were 
different from those that did not. Moreover, various control conditions were not re- 
ported. 
25-4.2.1. Lexicality Priming and Lexical Resource Sharing 
between the Hemispheres 
Consider a lateralized lexical decision task with bilateral stimulus strings where uni- 
lateral targets are cued peripherally. We have observed three distinct distractor effects 

25 
Language in the Right Hemisphere 
379 
of a letter string in the unattended field on the decision of the target in the attended 
field in normal subjects. First, there is a lexicality priming effect, such that word 
distractors enhance decision of word targets relative to nonword distractors, especially 
in the LVF (Iacoboni & Zaidel, 1996). This persists in the split brain (LB), although 
it is mediated by different, subcallosal, channels (Iacoboni, Rayman, & Zaidel, in 
preparation). Second, there is a bilateral loss that is selective to words, that is, lexical 
decision of unilateral word targets is more accurate than of word targets accompanied 
by different distractors (Iacoboni & Zaidel, 1996). This effect is absent or dramatically 
reduced in the split brain (LB) (Iacoboni, Rayman, & Zaidel, in preparation). Third, 
bilateral copies of the same target speed up RVF decisions of word targets ("bilateral 
gain") in normal subjects (Mohr, Pulvermtiller, & Zaidel, 1994) but not in LB (Mohr, 
Pulvermfiller, Rayman, & Zaidel, 1994). We interpret these results to mean (a) that 
there are separate modules for processing words and nonwords in each hemisphere, 
(b) that there is normally resource sharing between the word processing modules but 
not between the nonword processing modules in the two hemispheres, and (c) that 
the resource sharing is mediated by the corpus callosum. Consequently, (a) differences 
in the lexical competence of the two hemispheres are accentuated in the split brain, 
and (b) the linguistic competence of the disconnected RH underestimates the linguistic 
competence of the normal RH. 
25-5. RELATION OF LANGUAGE 
IN THE RIGHT 
HEMISPHERE 
TO ACQUIRED ALEXIA 
25-5.1. Pure Alexia 
These patients have a selective inability to read words visually. Their auditory lan- 
guage comprehension and speech are intact and they can also write fluently if no 
visual feedback is provided. Patients can only read by laboriously sounding out the 
letters one at a time ("letter-by-letter reading"). The hallmark of letter-by-letter read- 
ing is a massive length effect in reading aloud. The standard psycholinguistic account 
of it is in terms of impaired access to an abstract orthographic code, that is, failure 
of the Visual Analysis System in the dual-route model (e.g., Shallice, 1988). The stan- 
dard anatomical account of pure alexia is in terms of a lesion to primary visual cortex 
in the LH, usually resulting in a right homonymous hemianopia, and a splenial lesion 
resulting in posterior interhemispheric disconnection. The splenial lesion prevents 
transfer of visual shape information but permits transfer of abstract letter identities. 
Some letter-by-letter readers demonstrate covert or implicit reading. Thus, they may 
be able to perform correct forced choice pointing to a related picture in a multiple 
choice array, they may be able to make lexical decision, or they may be able to make 
semantic judgments, all without being able to identify the word or even being aware 
of it (Bub & Arguin, 1995). It is natural to interpret the paradoxical dissociation 
between overt and covert reading in pure alexia or letter-by-letter alexia in terms of 
a dual-process theory. It is particularly appealing to argue that overt reading reflects 
control by the damaged LH, whereas covert reading reflects temporary RH contri- 

380 
Eran Zaidel 
bution because of the classic anatomical disconnection account of pure alexia (Landis, 
Regard, & Serrat, 1980; Coslett & Saffran, 1989). Coslett and Saffran propose that 
both overt and covert reading in pure alexia reflect input from the RH. They posit 
that each hemisphere has an Early Visual Analysis System, an Object Recognition 
System, a Visual Analysis (Letter Identification) System, a Visual Input Lexicon, and 
a Semantic System. The model also assumes that there are callosal connections be- 
tween phylogenetically early modules, including Early Visual Processing, Object Rec- 
ognition, and Semantics, but not between "recent" modules, such as the Visual Input 
Lexicons. Splenial disconnection interrupts interhemispheric transfer during early vi- 
sual processing but permits interhemispheric transfer of letters-as-objects between the 
two Object Recognition Systems. This leads to letter-by-letter reading in the LH (Cos- 
.lett & Saffran, 1994). Implicit reading is then due to semantic access without verbal- 
ization in the RH. Coslett and Monsul (1994) provided more direct evidence for RH 
involvement in covert reading in pure alexia by showing that it was disrupted by right 
but not left temporal-parietal transcortical magnetic stimulation. In this view, pure 
alexia generally reflects a maladaptive maintenance of control in the diseased LH and 
inhibition of language in the intact RH, leading to letter-by-letter reading. RH control 
can occur when LH control is relinquished and this only occurs with brief presenta- 
tions and other conditions when LH strategies cannot cope with the stimuli. 
Arguin (personal communication, Montreal, April 14, 1996) also argues for a dual- 
process theory of letter-by-letter reading but opts for an opposite hemispheric inter- 
pretation. He distinguishes two pathways for reading, (a) the normal efficient abstract 
orthographic pathway, and (b) a compensatory "token" or shape-specific pathway 
essential for overt word recognition. Letter-by-letter readers use the token pathway 
but also preserve rapid access to an abstract orthographic pathway that controls covert 
reading tasks. Further, Arguin believes that the token pathway is supported by normal 
RH reading, whereas implicit reading in pure alexics is supported by the residual LH 
system. This is based on the assumption that the RH has no abstract letter identities. The 
evidence is from (a) Reuter-Lorenz and Baynes (1992), who showed a length effect in a 
variant of the word-superiority effect in the LVF of JW, and from (b) Marsolek, Kosslyn, 
and Squire (1992), who show selective same-case stem completion priming in the LVF 
of normal subjects. However, the relevance of these tasks to reading is questionable, and 
there is ample evidence, reviewed earlier, that the normal and disconnected RHs can 
form abstract letter identities. Circumstantial support for Arguin's position comes from 
(a) a SPECT study of a patient with pure alexia showing RH activation during letter- 
by-letter reading (Iacoboni & Lenzi, personal communication, Los Angeles, CA, Sep- 
tember 20, 1996) as well as from (b) a case study of an LH stroke patient with pure 
alexia who had a subsequent RH stroke, abolishing letter-by-letter reading (Bartolo- 
meo, Bachoud-Levi, Degos, & Boller, in press). 
25-5.2. Optic Aphasia 
These patients cannot name visual objects or words but can demonstrate their use by 
miming. They can name auditory or tactile stimuli. The standard account is in terms 

25 
Language in the Right Hemisphere 
381 
of a lesion to primary visual cortex together with a disruption of the splenium and 
more anterior portions of the corpus callosum. Coslett and Saffran (1994) see optic 
aphasia as a more severe form of pure alexia, where the callosal lesion extends further 
anteriorly than the splenium and disconnects the homotopic callosal channels that 
interconnect the Object Recognition Systems in the two hemispheres. This prevents 
the patient from transmitting individual letters as familiar visual forms from the RH 
to the LH so that even letter-by-letter reading is no longer possible. Schnider, Ben- 
son, and Scharre (1994) argue further that when the callosal damage extends even 
more anteriorly to disconnect the callosal channels that interconnect the semantic 
systems of the two hemispheres, the resulting symptoms are of visual agnosia. Then 
semantic access from vision reflects control by the damaged LH rather than by the 
intact RH. 
Common to these models is the assumption that each hemisphere has a separate 
Visual Analysis System, Object Recognition System, and Semantic System. This as- 
sumption is completely consistent with data from the disconnected hemispheres. The 
assumption challenges Warrington's model of visual object perception according to 
which the first stage of object perception, initial sensory analysis, occurs separately 
and in parallel in early visual centers in both hemispheres; the second stage, perceptual 
classification, including structural descriptions, is specialized in the posterior RH, 
whereas the third stage, semantic categorization, is specialized in the posterior LH 
(Shallice, 1988). Others who, like Warrington, resist positing a separate semantic sys- 
tem in the RH explain optic aphasia by a purely visual disconnection (e.g., Hillis & 
Caramazza, 1994). 
25-5.3. Deep Dyslexia 
These patients have large LH lesions with variable aphasia but their deficit in reading 
aloud shows three prominent symptoms: (a) semantic paralexias (opposites, superor- 
dinates, subordinates, coordinates, synonyms, and associates), (b) a concreteness / 
imageability and part-of-speech effect, where concrete words are read better than ab- 
stract words and nouns are read better than function words, and (c) failure of grapheme- 
phoneme translation as required in reading nonsense words aloud or matching strings 
with different end-spellings for rhyming. This profile is consistent with the reading 
profile of the disconnected RH and led to the "right hemisphere hypothesis of deep 
dyslexia" (e.g., Coltheart, 1983). Our version of this hypothesis (Schweiger, Zaidel, 
Field, & Dobkin, 1989) posits that the nonlexical route in the LH of the deep dyslexic 
is destroyed and that the lexical route in the LH is impaired. Consequently, when LH 
reading fails, control is shifted to the lexical route in the intact RH, with its loosely 
organized lexical semantics. Thus, the semantic paralexias, part of speech effect and 
concreteness effect all reflect lexical access by the RH. However, output phonology 
and articulation can still be controlled by the LH. Furthermore, the residual reading 
system in the LH is able to read aloud many words and sentences not within the 
competence of the RH. RH takeover in deep dyslexia is therefore dynamic and adap- 
tive. 

382 
Eran Zaidel 
Saffran, Bogyo, Schwartz, and Marin (1980) tested several deep dyslexic patients, 
and reported some LVF advantage in bilateral tachistoscopic presentations of lexical 
decision, but also an LVF advantage for the control tasks. Subsequently, Schweiger 
et al. (1989) described a deep dyslexic patient, RW, with intact fields and deep dys- 
graphia and Broca's aphasia. She showed an LVF advantage for lexical decision but 
not for length decision (does the string have more than four letters?) with the same 
stimuli, and she had a prevalence of semantic errors in reading aloud with LVF com- 
pared to RVF presentations. Ten years after trauma, RW has evolved into a phono- 
logical dyslexic (13 % of words attempted were semantic paralexias, 5 % self-corrected). 
However, we assumed that RW's earlier semantic paralexias reflected the stable lexical 
semantic organization of her RH, which should remain consistent following her re- 
covery. We reasoned that if RW read a stimulus word P as the semantically related 
word T, then P should serve as a selectively potent semantic prime for lateralized 
lexical decision of the target T in her LVE And if the lexical semantic organization 
in RW's RH characterizes that of the normal RH, then P should selectively prime T 
in lateralized lexical decision in the LVF of normal subjects as well. Against expec- 
tation, RW had significant priming of the semantic paralexias only in the RVE whereas 
normals had significant priming bilaterally (Langley & Zaidel, 1990; see Table 2). 
Thus, there is no evidence that RW's semantic paralexias reflected the unique semantic 
organization in her or the normals' RH. 
Another lateralized lexical decision experiment with RW used the same list of 
words (courtesy of P. H. K. Seymour) varying in frequency and regularity of grapheme- 
phoneme correspondence used earlier with LB and with normals (see Table 1, Section 
25-3.1). RW's accuracy did reveal a word Frequency by VF interaction, with a fre- 
quency effect in the LVF but not in the RVF and no regularity effect in either VF 
(Table 1). This is what we would expect if her nonlexical route is inoperative due to 
the left brain damage. 
If our arguments are correct, then evidence from aphasia generally underestimates 
the language competence of the normal as well as the disconnected RH. The intact 
RH is generally free of the dramatic language deficits that follow LH damage, such

as word deafness, word blindness, or global aphasia. Thus, the psycholinguistic profile 
of an LH-damaged patient is determined not only by the lost functions of the LH and 
by the residual competence of the RH but also critically by the balance of activation 
in a system of control that incorporates several levels of facilitatory and inhibitory 
circuits. Analysis of these control structures and their response to brain damage is an 
important topic for further research. 
25-6. CONCLUSIONS 
Coordinated laterality experiments in split-brain patients and in normal subjects sug- 
gest that the disconnected RH underestimates the language competence of the normal 
RH. The reason is that even when the two normal hemispheres draw on separate 
lexical representations and exhibit independent strategies, there occur dynamic sharing 
of resources and variable automatic priming effects across the commissures, which 
effectively increase RH language competence and range. Even the split brain permits 
some subcallosal linguistic interhemispheric interaction, including transfer of resources 
from the disconnected LH to the RH, so that the disconnected RH may overestimate 
the linguistic competence of the RH following surgical removal or anesthesia of the 
LH in adulthood. 
Lexical variables that show independent effects on word recognition in each normal 
hemisphere include length (orthographic), concreteness, emotionality, part-of-speech, 
associative priming, and diverse semantic congruity effects (semantics), derivational 
morphology (semantic/phonological), grapheme-phoneme regularity (phonological), 
and grammatic priming (syntactic). 
The new emerging theory from converging clinical and experimental evidence is 
that RH language competence can assume any of a set of progressive degrees of 
independence from LH language. With enough resources, the normal RH can even 
perform grapheme-phoneme correspondence, perhaps also speak. This argues against 
a strictly modular view of natural language competence. The ability of the normal RH 
to perform a task then depends not only on its basic competence but also on its 
concurrent cognitive load, freedom from inhibition, and access to LH resources. In- 
deed, a similar account may also hold for the normal LH! This is not to argue that 
RH language competence is as wide as LH competence, but it does suggest greater 
potential RH competence for online natural language processing than is commonly 
assumed.

CHAPTER 26 
The Right Hemisphere and 
Recovery From Aphasia 
Marcel Kinsbourne 
New School for Social Research, New York, New York 10011 
Although language function is overwhelmingly left lateralized, significant recov- 
ery from aphasia is possible even after the left language territory is extensively 
damaged. Some of this recovery is mediated by a transfer of language represen- 
tation from the lesioned left to the intact right hemisphere. This phenomenon 
qualifies the view that language is the product of a unique left-hemisphere lan- 
guage acquisition device or module. It may also have broader significance for the 
mechanisms of cognitive recovery after focal cerebral injury. 
Although cognitive functions are distinctively localized in the cerebrum, the cognitive 
deficits that result from focal cerebral lesions often recover, in part or altogether. This 
recovery cannot be attributed to regeneration, of which the central nervous system is 
virtually incapable (Kolb, 1995). Some early recovery is due to a shrinking penumbra 
of neurons that are in suspended animation surrounding an area destroyed by an acute 
insult such as a stroke; that is, parts of the compromised area resume function (Furlan, 
Marchal, Viader, Derlon, & Baron, 1996). But even excision of a whole cerebral 
hemisphere can be followed by a degree of recovery of that hemisphere's specialized 
functions. Brain areas that do not normally control a given function must therefore 
assume control when the specialized area defaults (Finger & Stein, 1982). I address 
two questions nested in this generalization, using aphasia as the case in point (for a

broader review, see Cappa, this volume). Is the territory that assumes control some- 
times in the opposite hemisphere, rather than ipsilateral, adjacent to the damaged area? 
If so, when the right hemisphere assumes control of language, does it program lan- 
guage, in the same way as the left hemisphere did, or in a different way, for instance, 
one that reflects its distinctive specialization for simultaneous/relational rather than 
sequential/analytic processing strategies (Kinsbourne, 1982)? Answers to these ques- 
tions have implications that transcend the specific issues addressed. 
1. They bear on the view that the human left hemisphere houses a unique 
language acquisition device (LAD) in modular form (Fodor, 1983; Lenneberg, 
1967) that is structurally and functionally discontinuous with cortex dedicated 
to other cognitive functions. 
2. They bear on more general questions about recovery of function in the human 
nervous system. Does it involve the compensatory intervention of territories 
not previously used to control language function and if so, does it deploy 
novel strategies (Luria, 1963), or does it more simply involve the same 
organization of verbal skill emanating from a different cortical territory? 
I shall return to these general issues after I have discussed the existing data base 
on the right hemisphere's role in language recovery. 
26-1. LANGUAGE 
LATERALIZATION 
The questions as framed assume that language is left lateralized in the intact brain. 
This generalization is almost correct. It holds for 99% of right-handed individuals, 
who constitute some 90% of all people. The incidence of crossed aphasia, that is, 
right-sided lesions causing aphasia, is estimated at 1% (Russell & Espir, 1961). Among 
the nonright-handed minority, up to 60% have bilateral language control, according 
to Loring et al. (1990). Loring et al.'s data is particularly persuasive; they based their 
conclusions on bilateral intracarotid amytal testing, as well as direct mapping of lan- 
guage cortex in the awake individual. Their method is more definitive than the lower 
estimate offered by Rasmussen and Milner (1977). It follows that the right hemisphere 
is to some extent involved in language control in the majority of nonright-handers. 
Interestingly, right-hemisphere dominance for language is comparatively rare, even in 
nonright-handers (Loring et al., 1990). One may then ask, when nonright-handers use 
language do they in fact use distinctive strategies, or identical ones, only the anatom- 
ical localization differing? 
No evidence exists that left-handers whose right hemispheres participate in lan- 
guage functioning use language at all differently from the right-handed majority. 
Whether underlying processes differ in this subgroup has not been experimentally 
addressed. However, Hecaen, De Agostini, and Monzon-Montes (1981) emphasize that 
the frequency distribution of aphasic symptoms in left-handers after right-hemisphere 
damage does not noticeably differ from that of right-handers after left-hemisphere 
damage. According to them, left-handers differ with respect to the wider dispersion 

26 
Right Hemisphere and Recovery

and lesser focalization of language circuitry, but not with respect to what that circuitry 
can accomplish. This leaves open the possibility that the reorganization that takes 
place after injury of the language areas, may, if it includes the right hemisphere, 
approximate its role to that which it normally plays in many nonright-handed indi- 
viduals. Also, crossed aphasics, who premorbidly presumably processed language in 
their right hemispheres, are not thought to have had premorbid language processes 
that were at all deviant. I exclude left-handers from further discussion, and only con- 
sider patients who became aphasic after left-hemisphere injury. 
26-2. THE LEFT-TO-RIGHT 
TRANSFER HYPOTHESIS 
No doubt, many aphasics base their degree of recovery on residual intact cortex in 
the lesioned left hemisphere. Recovery based on the left hemisphere is not possible, 
however, after left hemispherectomy, and yet partial recovery has been repeatedly 
documented (Burklund & Smith, 1977; Gott, 1973; Ogden, 1988; Rossing, 1975; 
Smith, 1966). The patient of Cummings, Benson, Walsh, and Levine (1979) whose 
left language area was devastated, made quite impressive strides, especially in com- 
prehension (see also Willmes & Poeck, 1993). I now explore the generality of such 
contralateral compensation. 
At the dawn of aphasiology, Broca (1865b), struck by extensive recovery from 
aphasia even after very large left-hemisphere lesions, suggested a role for the right- 
hemisphere in such recovery. Since then, right-hemisphere compensation in aphasia 
(the "left-to-right transfer hypothesis") has been inferred from: 
1. Cases in which a left-sided lesion causes aphasia, the aphasia recovers, and a 
right-hemisphere lesion reinstates it. 
2. Intracarotid amytal suppression of aphasic language after right injection, rather 
than, as is usually observed, after left injection. 
3. Left rather than the normative right ear and hemifield advantage on verbal 
laterality testing of aphasics. 
4. Greater right than left event-related activation in aphasics during language 
tasks. 
The evidence from these sources will now be critically discussed in sequence. 
26-3. BILATERAL 
LESION 
EFFECTS 
1. Aphasics whose language recovery after left hemisphere lesions was subsequently 
reversed by a second, right-sided insult have been reported since Gowers (1887) 
inferred that recovery was due to supplemental action of the corresponding areas 
in the right hemisphere "in patients in whom speech has again been lost when a 
fresh lesion occurred in this part of the right hemisphere" (p. 132). In early reports 

388 
Marcel Kinsbourne 
the aphasia recovery was not thoroughly documented. But the recovery from and 
relapse of language deficit was comprehensively documented in the case study of Lee, 
Nakada, Deal, Lynn, and Kwee (1984), in two cases each reported by Cambier, E1- 
ghozi, Signoret, and Henin (1983) and Basso, Gardelli, Grasso, and Marriotti (1989), 
and most recently in a case study by Cappa, Miozzo, and Frugoni (1994). The obvious 
inference is that the right hemisphere was the site of recovered language (see review 
by Cappa & Vallar, 1992). However, Gainotti (1993) offered the following criticisms 
of this interpretation of the lesion data: 
a. The right-sided lesion may have impaired recovered language in the left hem- 
isphere through transcallosal diaschisis (Andrews, 1991). Diaschisis (Von Monakow, 
1914/1969) is a hypothesized adverse effect of a dysfunctional area of brain on a 
distant area to which it projects. 
However, it is inherent in the notion of diaschisis that this recedes over time. The 
concept is therefore not applicable to the majority of cases in question, in whom the 
relapse in aphasia proved to be permanent. 
b. If the right hemisphere were the only backup system, then after right-sided 
injury there should be no recovery. But recovery had been reported (Lee et al., 1984, 
one case of Basso et al., 1989). 
However, the concept of right-hemisphere compensation does not exclude com- 
pensation by yet other structures (such as cortical and subcortical areas adjacent to 
the right-sided lesion). 
c. The right-sided insult complicated the language deficit by inducing cortical 
deafness (bitemporal) and buccolingual dyspraxia (bifrontal), rather than by compro- 
mising language processing proper. 
But the described language deficits cannot all be shoehorned into these two cate- 
gories. 
2. Intracarotid amytal injections, which normally inactivate speech expression 
when left-sided, in aphasics have done so when right-sided. Kinsbourne (1971) re- 
ported three such cases, in two of whom left-sided anesthesia was also done and 
left the patients' speech unchanged. Similar observations were recorded by Czopf 
(1972) in the 19 more severe and long-standing cases of his series of 25 patients with 
aphasia, also studied with intracarotid amytal. These observations render it beyond 
question that the right hemisphere can assume control of expressive speech after 
left-hemisphere injury (particularly if it is extensive). It appears that the right hemi- 
sphere assumes its expressive verbal role gradually rather than all at once. This could 
either reflect a learning process or the gradual lifting of inhibition or diaschisis em- 
anating from the left-sided lesion. 
The situation for receptive speech is less clear, as this is, at least at a simple level, 
within the usual range of right-hemisphere abilities, as demonstrated in callosally 
sectioned individuals, and nonaphasic patients who undergo left-sided amytal anes- 
thesia (Hart et al., 1991). Receptive abilities after left-hemisphere compromise could 
therefore reflect a continuing right-sided capability, rather than true compensation. 
The evidence marshaled under headings (1) and (2) contrasts interestingly with 
split-brain evidence that the right hemisphere lacks the ability to use or produce either 

26

phonology or syntax (Zaidel, 1983b). Either this is not true of all right hemispheres 
(Gazzaniga & Smylie, 1984) or the right hemisphere does have syntactic and pho- 
nological potential, but which is only released when the left language area is massively 
inactivated by lesion that cause aphasia, rather than simply disconnected from the 
right hemisphere by callosal section. 
On the other hand, it cannot be that all aphasics recover by right-hemisphere com- 
pensation. As shown by the intracarotid amytal findings, some recovery is based on 
the left brain, and also, some unilaterally lesioned aphasics recover little if at all. In 
fact, the majority of children with left cortical dysplasia retain left-sided language 
lateralization (Duchovny et al., 1996). After postnatal injury, left-to-right transfer is 
thought to vary in frequency inversely with age (Varga-Khadem, O'Gorman, & Wai- 
ters, 1985). 
26-4. LATERALITY 
IN APHASIA 
3. Laterality studies of aphasics have often shown an attentuation or even a reversal 
of the expected right-sided dichotic or hemifield advantage for verbal material con- 
sistent with right-hemisphere control of language (Johnson, Summers, & Weidner, 
1977; Moore & Weidner, 1974, 1975). But insofar as laterality reflects an attentional 
bias contralateral to the active hemisphere (Kinsbourne, 1970a), this finding might be 
nonspecific. It is confounded by the left-sided lesion itself. Lateral attending is im- 
plemented by the reciprocal interaction of opponent processors that respectively direct 
attention to the right and to the left (Kinsbourne, 1974). A left-sided lesion might 
disinhibit leftward attending nonspecifically, resulting in a leftward bias of attention 
irrespective of the processing domain. A left-ear or hemifield advantage for verbal 
material might result, even if the left hemisphere remains in control of language. 
Longitudinal studies of aphasics have sometimes shown an increasing left-ear bias 
over time, consistent with the gradual assumption of a verbal role by the right hemi- 
sphere (Petit & Noll, 1979). In the data of others this has been true only for a nonfluent 
subset of patients (Castro-Caldas & Botelho, 1980) or not true at all (Niccum & 
Speaks, 1986). 
4. Event-related electrophysiological measures during verbal tasks evidence more 
right than left cerebral activation (Moore 1989; Papaniculaou et al., 1988). However, 
it may be that the lesion disrupts and obscures such changes on the left. Regional 
blood flow measurements find greater right activation (Demeurisse & Cappon, 1987; 
Knopman, Rubens, Selnes, Klassen, & Meyer, 1984; Meyer, Sakai, Yamaguchi, Ya- 
mamoto, & Shaw, 1980; Yamaguchi, Meyer, Sakai, & Yamamoto, 1980). This right- 
sided improvement appears to increase over time. It is generally most clearly demon- 
strable in Broca's aphasics. Positron emission tomography has either revealed bilateral 
increments in activation over time (Cappa et al., 1991), or highlighted the importance 
of the left temporoparietal area (Metter et al., 1981). But most recently, clear evidence 
for right-sided activation contralateral to the language area has been reported in Wer- 
nicke's aphasics engaged in nonword repetition and verb generation (Weiller et al., 

390 
Marcel Kinsbourne 
1995). Transcranial Doppler methodology has also provided evidence that recovered 
aphasics enlist their right hemisphere when they perform word-fluency tasks (Silves- 
trini, Troisi, Matteis, Cupini, & Caltagirone, 1995). 
26-5. DEGREE OF LANGUAGE COMPENSATION 
After left-to-right transfer, does the right hemisphere subserve language to the extent 
that it has been shown capable of doing so in other studies, notably split-brain, as 
well as laterality? Or does the reorganization open up a broader capability, even co- 
extensive with normal language use? Specifically, is the compensation limited to the 
lexical-semantic domain (reviewed by Joanette, Goulet, & Hannequin, 1990), or does 
it also extend to syntax and phonology, generally thought to necessitate the unique 
specialization of the language hemisphere? This fundamental issue has not been rig- 
orously studied. Clinical reports of right hemisphere-based language recovery are usu- 
ally insufficiently detailed, not least because we are not yet able to identify reliably 
the controlling hemisphere in individual aphasic patients on clinical grounds, and we 
cannot anticipate which very few cases will suffer relapse due to subsequent right- 
hemisphere infarction. The intracarotid amytal procedure offers the potential for thor- 
ough testing of individuals identified as right hemisphere-supported for language, but 
it is rarely applied to aphasics, and such a study has not been reported. We are left 
with circumstantial evidence pointing in opposite directions. On the one hand, the 
apparent nonexistence of a right hemisphere-compensated aphasic syndromemfor ex- 
ample, one in which phonology and syntax are inaccessible, but lexical-semantic 
function is preservedmsuggests that the right hemisphere can support various patterns 
of partial (or even complete?) recovery. On the other hand, conservatism is in order, 
given the strong evidence from other sources of the putatively incomplete nature of 
any recovery from focal cortical deficit, a principle first articulated by J. Hughlings 
Jackson (1879-1880), who posited hierarchical representations of cognitive function 
with lower levels, when disinhibited by selective injury of higher levels, showing a 
sparser and more rigidly constrained repertoire for the function in question. On such 
a view, the right hemispheres might be considered "lower" for language purposes 
and not capable of fully restoring the previous level. Given the importance in principle 
of this question, and the dramatically increasing repertoire of psychophysiological 
techniques adaptable to this issue, it could rightly be regarded as a research priority 
to define the limits of right language compensation in identified patients with left- 
to-right transfer. 
26-6. MECHANISM OF TRANSFER 
It would be easier to validate right hemisphere use in aphasia, and identify it in the 
individual case, if it accounted for a specific subset of aphasic syndromes. If the right 
hemisphere's productions betrayed its bent toward relational processing, then a "right- 

26 
Right Hemisphere and Recovery 
391 
hemisphere aphasia" would have long been recognized. Contrary to such expectation, 
it appears that any of the major left-hemisphere aphasia syndromes can derive from 
uneven compensation by the right hemisphere. This is mystifying, in view of the 
anatomical relationships that have been assumed to obtain between lesion locus in the 
left hemisphere and the type of the aphasic handicap (e.g., Geschwind, 1970). It is 
hard to envisage an effect of the location of a left-sided lesion on the nature of a 
processing limitation in the undamaged right hemisphere (except possibly by dias- 
chisis). The notoriously high incidence of exceptions to the classical functional anat- 
omy may even largely be due to dilution of the brain-behavior relationships by left- 
to-right transfer aphasias. In any case, the incidence of right-hemisphere compensation, 
and the functional limitations inherent in such compensation, are obviously subject to 
massive individual variation. It is intriguing that the verbal capabilities of the discon- 
nected right hemisphere are also widely variable (Gazzaniga, Smylie, Baynes, Mc- 
Cleary, & Hurst, 1984). 
By what physiological mechanism is transfer effected? If by a dissipation of left- 
to-right cross inhibition (e.g., Kinsbourne, 1970b; Moscovitch, 1973), that must be a 
gradual process. Or reorganization may be less specific, simply taking advantage of 
what intact and usable neural network is available, in either hemisphere. This may in 
turn interact with intersubject variability in premorbid, albeit latent, right-hemisphere 
verbal skills. Finally, any proposed mechanism will have to explain why many se- 
verely aphasic left stroke patients make no significant recovery at all. Why not if left 
lesions disinhibit, or if reorganization uses an intact neural network? 
The sources of variability of the language potential of the right hemisphere are 
unknown. It would not be surprising, however, if a part of the brain that is engaged 
in an activity other than that for which it is primarily specialized shows interindividual 
variability. The language potential of the right hemisphere is perhaps genetically un- 
derspecified, and therefore subject to great variability based on fortuitous factors in 
embryogenesis (and even postnatal experience). 
26-7. IMPLICATIONS 
OF RIGHT-HEMISPHERE 
COMPENSATION 
For neurolinguistic theory, left-to-right transfer might engender some skepticism about 
the uniqueness of human language circuitry and its allegedly modular organization. 
The human right hemisphere, compared unfavorably with the cerebrum of the chim- 
panzee by Gazzaniga and Smylie (1984), can acquire useful language nonetheless. 
Certainly, vast tracts of the cerebral neural network afford elements of language po- 
tential. When nonlanguage cortex assumes a language function, it may even conform 
to the same constraints as language cortex. The networks of the classical language 
area, and other networks of the brain, may differ in degree only in how amenable 
they are to the language function. Any "language acquisition device" must be co- 
extensive with much usually nonlanguage cerebral cortex. Such a "continuity" view 
of language in the brain would be congenial to those who look for continuity between 

392 
Marcel Kinsbourne 
the preverbal and the verbal infant, and who suspect the existence of language pre- 
cursors in nonhuman primates. 
Outstanding questions about the right hemispere's role might prove pertinent also to 
the practical issues of aphasia remediation (see Code, 1987). If the right hemisphere re- 
organizes so as to duplicate the left hemisphere's manner of controlling language, then 
perhaps no modification in remedial methods is called for. But if it is limited (e.g., to 
lexical-semantic processing), then perhaps patients should be taught to use their lexical- 
semantic skills to the extent possible, bypassing the phonological-syntactic routes. 
Embedding verbal material in tasks that are known to be congruent with right- 
hemisphere specialization (e.g., musical intonation therapy) might assist this hemi- 
sphere in assuming its newer, verbal role. Finally, nonspecific stimulation of the right 
hemisphere (e.g., analogous with vestibular stimulation of the right hemisphere in 
cases of left neglect of space and person) is worth a try. 
26-8. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
Although many specifics remain to be determined, the evidence is overwhelming that 
the right hemisphere sometimes participates in recovery from aphasia. Should we 
conclude that the human right hemisphere has latent language equipment, evolved as 
a backup system in case of left-sided injury? An alternative to this implausible post 
hoc assumption would be desirable. 
Cerebral anatomy constrains us into dichotomous thinking: right versus left. But 
more probably the cortical gray matter functions as a continuous integrated (as well 
as differentiated) network. In the left-to-right transfer phenomena, we may be observ- 
ing a special case of a much more general attributemthe multipotentiality of the 
cerebral network. There may be no difference in principle between the ipsilateral and 
the contralateral rearrangements of the network that enable recovery in many aphasic 
patients. Left-to-right transfer may be a test case for the broader task of identifying 
the mechanism of recovery after any focalized function is impaired.

Anatomical Asymmetries in 
Language-Related Cortex and 
Their,Relation to Callosal Function

Lateralization of linguistic and visuospatial functions has anatomical correlates 
that can be observed in gross brain anatomy, especially in the size and position 
of the planum temporale. Furthermore, the Sylvian fissure has qualitatively dis- 
tinct morphologies that are unequally distributed across the hemispheres. These 
correlates may reflect the differential development of specific architectonic areas 
in the two hemispheres, which are of direct relevance for lateralized function. 
Additionally, interhemispheric connectivity is inversely related to anatomical 
asymmetry in males more than in females, indicating that there may be sex dif- 
ferences in the interhemispheric organization for language. We discuss these find- 
ings in the context of the development of hemispheric asymmetry and its relation 
to interhemispheric interaction, both from an ontogenetic and a phylogenetic 
viewpoint. 
Anatomical asymmetry in language-related cortex has been found at the levels of gross 
anatomy, size of cytoarchitectonic areas, and neuronal dendritic patterns (for recent

reviews, see Witelson, 1995; Galaburda, 1995). To avoid confusion, in this chapter 
we will speak of lateralization to mean functional laterality, and of asymmetry when 
speaking of structural differences between the hemispheres. Across subjects, the de- 
gree and direction of anatomical asymmetry have been found to correlate with func- 
tional lateralizationmespecially handedness and linguistic skillsmand more recently 
a relation between these asymmetries and interhemispheric communication has been 
detected. The two lateralized hemispheres must interact with each other through the 
corpus callosum in order to generate coherent behavior. Therefore, callosal function 
is of direct relevance for the appropriate workings of a lateralized brain. 
The main problem to be addressed in this chapter is how callosal connectivity 
relates to hemispheric asymmetry. In a lateralized or asymmetric brain, is there an 
increase in interhemispheric relations to compensate for the differences in hemispheric 
capacity? Or does callosal connectivity decrease, thus progressively isolating the two 
hemispheres? Or is it the other way around, with changes in callosal connections 
inducing the generation of asymmetry in the brain? Partial answers and lines of re- 
search oriented to elucidate these questions will be suggested here, from anatomical 
and embryological viewpoints. In the first part of the chapter, recent developments 
on structural asymmetry in the human brain will be reviewed, followed in the sec- 
ond part with studies on callosal anatomy and the relation between these two varia- 
bles. 
27-1. ANATOMICAL ASYMMETRY 
IN PERISYLVIAN REGIONS 
Only after Geschwind and Levitsky's (1968) classic paper, did the concept that the 
human brain is structurally asymmetrical become widely accepted. In an analysis of 
100 human brains, Geschwind and Levitsky found that the planum temporale, a planar 
cortical field located in the posterior floor of the Sylvian fissure (see Figure 1), was 
larger on the left in 65% of the cases and larger on the right in 11%, while symmetric 
plana were found in 24% of the specimens. In the left hemisphere, the planum tem- 
porale is located in a region that overlaps with Wernicke's area, the posterior language 
region. This asymmetry is associated with a longer Sylvian fissure on the left side 
(Witelson, 1995; Galaburda, 1995). The planum temporale corresponds to a cytoar- 
chitectonic area denominated as Tpt by Galaburda and Sanides (1980), which is 
strongly asymmetric toward the left side (having a volume up to seven times larger 
in the left than in the right; Galaburda, Le May, Kemper, & Geschwind, 1978). Asym- 
metries in the Sylvian fissure can be observed in 31-week fetuses or even before, and 
newborns already have the distribution observed in adults (see Witelson, 1995). 
Regions related to Broca's language area have also been found to be asymmetric 
(Albanese, Merlo, Albanese, & G6mez., 1989; Foundas, Leonard, & Heilman, 1995; 
Foundas, Leonard, Gilmore, Fennell, & Heilman, 1996), but they will not be reviewed 
here since they have not been analyzed in relation to interhemispheric communication.

27-1.1. In Vivo Studies Relating Anatomical Asymmetry 
and Functional Laterality 
In vivo imaging techniques such as carotid angiography and computerized tomography 
(CT) were initially fundamental to establish a relation between behavioral lateraliza- 
tion and anatomical asymmetry (Damasio & Geschwind, 1984). More recently, mag- 
netic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of cerebral asymmetries in the language areas 
of living subjects have been performed, confirming the concept of a relation between 
anatomical asymmetry and functional laterality in both Wernicke's area (Kertesz, Polk, 
Black, & Howell, 1992; Bergvall, Habib, Jiddane, Rumeau, & Salamon, 1986; Stein- 
metz, Volkmann, J~incke, & Freund, 1991; Foundas, Leonard, Gilmore, Fennell, & 
Heilman, 1994; Foundas, Leonard, & Heilman, 1995; J~incke, Schlaug, Huang, & 
Steinmetz, 1995; Habib, Robichon, L6vrier, Khalil, & Salamon, 1995) and Broca's 
area (Foundas et al., 1995, 1996). In general, the strongest behavioral indicators of 
anatomical asymmetry in language regions are handedness and linguistic lateralization 
(as determined by dichotic listening, visual field advantage, or the sodium amytal 
test). Furthermore, there is a good correlation between right-handedness and left- 
language dominance (Witelson, 1995), and perhaps the latter evolved from an already 
lateralized brain with regard to handedness and certain visuospatial functions. An 
interesting finding is that, among left-handers, those who have inverted writing tend 
to show leftward asymmetry of the planum temporale, while those having noninverted 
writing have a rightward asymmetry (Foundas et al., 1995). Using MRI, Habib et al. 
(1995) found two leftward asymmetric parameters: the size of the planum temporale, 
and the distance between the central sulcus and the end of the Sylvian fissure. These 

396 
Francisco Aboitiz and AndrOs Ide 
two asymmetries were not correlated. Although each of the two asymmetry measures 
correlates with handedness, the two asymmetries combined showed a much stronger 
correlation to manual preference. This indicates that the overall morphological pattern 
rather than that of a specific measure may yield better estimates of lateralization of 
function. Anomalous patterns of asymmetry have been reported in the brains of dys- 
lexics (see Galaburda, 1993). Interestingly, Schlaug, Jfincke, Huang, & Steinmetz 
(1995) found that musicians gifted with perfect pitch have a highly asymmetric planum 
temporale (left larger than right). 
27-1.2. Sex Differences 
Recent reports on postmortem material (Witelson & Kigar, 1992; Aboitiz, Scheibel, 
& Zaidel, 1992; Ide, Rodrfguez, Zaidel, & Aboitiz, 1996) indicate that sex differences 
in Sylvian asymmetries are not significant, although using MRI Kulynych, Vladar, 
Jones, and Weinberger (1994) reported asymmetry of the planum temporale in males 
but not females. Using CT, Mussolino and Dellatolas (1991) suggest that functional 
laterality has a stronger structural correlate in males than in females; and in a post- 
mortem study Witelson and Kigar (1992) determined that the horizontal segment of 
the Sylvian fissure (see the next section) tended to be bilaterally larger in right-handed 
than in nonconsistent right-handed men (in females there were no differences). In 
general, many studies have determined that when an anatomical relation exists be- 
tween functional laterality and structural asymmetry, it is more significant in males 
than in females. However, this difference may be marginally significant or simply not 
robust, resulting in discrepant findings across studies when sample sizes are at the 
limit of statistical power. 
27-1.3. Morphology of the Sylvian Fissure and the Planum 
Temporale and Their Variability 
Since the macroscopic morphology of the human brain is now accessible in vivo, in 
order to determine reliable structure-function neurolinguistic correlations it is of the 
greatest interest to establish the precise arrangements of cortical areas in different sulci 
and gyri, especially for regions like the planum temporale and cytoarchitectonic area 
Tpt. This is of importance also because there is an immense individual variability in 
the morphology of the Sylvian fissure. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the 
variability of this region has been performed Ide et al., (1996). Anatomically, the 
Sylvian fissure divides into an anterior segment that ends posteriorly in the gyrus of 
Heschl (containing the primary and secondary auditory areas); behind the gyrus of 
Heschl there is usually a horizontal segment containing the lateral extension of the 
planum temporale. More posteriorly, the Sylvian fissure bifurcates into two, usually 
more superficial ascending and descending rami (see Figure 2). There are two main 
types of Sylvian fissure. In the standard type, the ascending ramus is larger and deeper 
than the descending one (Figure 2A). Two subtypes can be distinguished within the

FIGURE 2 Three common types of Sylvian fissure: A, the superior or ascending branch (S) is longer 
than the inferior. A1, the horizontal ramus (Ho) is relatively long (27.5% of the cases); Az, the horizontal 
ramus (Ho) is rather short, but the ascending branch (S) is very long and deep (33.75% of the cases). B, 
the superior ramus (S) is distorted and directed forward (21.25% of the cases). The remaining 17.5% of 
the cases belong to different types. 
standard type, according to the relative length of the horizontal segment (compare 
types A1 and A2 in Figure 2); type A2 being more common in the right hemisphere 
(Table 1). Ide et al. (1996) have also described a type of fissure (Figure 2B) in which 
a sometimes small, but other times relatively long fissure, directed upward and forward 
(instead of upward and backward) exists, that is more common in the left hemisphere 
(Table 1). This type of fissure corresponds in many cases to what other authors have 
described as the absence of an ascending ramus (Steinmetz, Ebeling, Huang, & Kahn, 
1990; Witelson, & Kigar, 1992). Ide et al's. (1996) interpretation is that the forward- 
directed ramus is a distorted and sometimes vestigial superior branch. 
The distinct fissurization patterns may result from differences in the relative growth 
of specific cortical regions, which in turn may be directly associated with divergent 
modes of cortical processing. In particular, the position of the planum temporale and 
area Tpt may differ in the three fissure types reported here, an issue of relevance for 
studies that incorporate imaging analyses. For example, Witelson and Kigar (1992) 
suggest that in some cases (in their "V-type" of fissure) the planum temporale 
runs into the ascending branch of the Sylvian fissure. Ide et al. (1996) assert that 
Witelson and Kigar's "V-type" corresponds to their type A2 (Figure 2) and agree 
with the latter regarding the position of the planum in this type. However, in the other 
cases (especially type B) it appears that the planum temporale is restricted to the 
horizontal segment of the Sylvian fissure. Since type A2 is more common on the right,

this position of the planum may reflect the development of cortical areas related to 
right-hemisphere skills or the reduction in the size of areas related to left-hemisphere 
skills, while the type B fissure that is more common on the left may be related to the 
development of cortical areas involved in linguistic skills. In this context, the issue of 
the location of the planum temporale may not be as important as the location and size 
of asymmetric areas such as Tpt. For instance, it could be that Tpt closely corresponds 
to the planum in some cases but not in others. Further studies are needed to settle the 
question of a correspondence between variability at the level of gross anatomy and 
variability at the level of cytoarchitectonics. 
27-2. THE CORPUS CALLOSUM 
27-2.1. Anatomy of Callosal Connections 
Another anatomical structure that appears implicated in lateralization is the corpus 
callosum, a massive tract containing some 200,000,000 fibers (Aboitiz, Scheibel, 
Fisher, & Zaidel, 1992a) connecting the two cerebral hemispheres. A commonly used 
and straightforward method to subdivide the corpus callosum is the partition proposed 
by Witelson (1985), in which the corpus callosum has been arbitrarily divided into 
three regions according to maximal straight length. The anterior third (genu) is a rather 
bulbous region that contains fibers connecting prefrontal cortices. The mid-third is the 
mid-body of the corpus callosum, a slender region that contains projections from 
motor, somatosensory, and auditory cortices. The posterior third is divided into the 
posterior fifth (the splenium), which contains temporal, parietal, and occipital (visual) 
fibers; and the isthmus, a region between the mid-body (mid-third) and the splenium 
(posterior fifth), which is believed to contain fibers connecting superior temporal and 
parietal regions (perisylvian areas). 

27 
Asymmetries and Corpus Callosum 
399 
27-2.2. Fiber Types and Regional Differentiation 
of the Corpus Callosum 
In the human, callosal fiber diameters may range from 0.4 to 15 mm in diameter, but 
the most common fiber diameters are found between 0.6 and 1 mm; unmyelinated 
fibers are scarce as seen in light microscopy (about 5% of the total, except in the 
genu, where they may compose about 16%; Aboitiz et al., 1992a). The fiber com- 
position of the corpus callosum reflects the topographic arrangement of cortical areas, 
as there are regional differences in terms of the proportions and densities of fibers of 
distinct diameter (Aboitiz et al., 1992a; see Figure 3). Fast-conducting, large-diameter 
fibers (larger than 3 mm in diameter) tend to be concentrated in the posterior body 
and the posterior splenium, which may correspond to the representation of primary and 
secondary sensorimotor areas, particularly auditory and somatosensory (posterior mid- 
body) and visual (posterior splenium). On the other hand, callosal regions represen- 
ting higher-order areas are mainly composed of small-diameter, slower-conducting 
fibers. This is of interest, as callosal cells connecting primary and secondary senso- 
rimotor areas are relatively few, restricted to a narrow strip in the border of the area 
that usually represents the sensory or motor midline, while in higher-order areas cal- 
losal cells can be found all along the respective regions (see Innocenti, 1986). In

primary and secondary visual and somatosensory cortices, the role of fast-conducting, 
gigantic callosal fibers may have to do with fusing the two hemirepresentations in 
both hemispheres, while in auditory areas they may represent an additional stage of 
fast bilateral interaction in the auditory pathway that serves to localize sounds in space 
(Aboitiz et al., 1992a). 
27-2.3. Individual Differences in the Corpus Callosum 
The gross morphology of the corpus callosum shows a large degree of individual 
diversity. Differences in the cross-sagital size of the corpus callosum may have 
functional significance, as a larger total or partial callosal size reflects an increased 
number of small-diameter fibers (Aboitiz et al., 1992a), although the sparse large- 
caliber fibers of more than 3 mm are so variable in density that they fail to show a 
relation with callosal size. An additional factor contributing to callosal size is myelin 
deposition, which also has functional correlates since increased myelination is asso- 
ciated with higher conduction velocity and hence shorter interhemispheric transmission 
times. 
27-2.4. Sex Differences 
Some studies indicate a more bulbous splenium in females than in males, while ad- 
ditional studies reported a sex difference in the size of the isthmus in favor of females 
(for recent reports, see Allen, Richey, Chai, & Gorski, 1991; Witelson, 1989; Clarke, 
& Zaidel, 1994). Other findings suggest no sex differences in callosal morphology or 
fiber composition (for a review, see Aboitiz et al., 1992, 1992a; see also Steinmetz, 
Staiger, Schlaug, Huang, & J~incke, 1995). 
Taking all the conflicting reports on callosal sex differences, probably the safest 
conclusion at this point is that if they exist, they are not robust. This contrasts with 
the striking difference in brain size between the sexes (Aboitiz et al., 1992a; Steinmetz 
et al., 1995; although Rauch & Jinkins, 1994 found no sex differences in callosal 
size relative to brain volume). Peters (1988) has argued that sex differences in brain 
weight relate to cortical areas connected with sensorimotor surfaces, but not to 
higher-order areas involved in cognition, which make up the bulk of callosal fibers 
(see earlier in this section), but there is no strong evidence in his support. Despite 
differences in overall size, it is still unclear whether the male brain actually has more 
cortical cells than the female. Haug (1987) and Witelson, Glezer, and Kigar (1995) 
have reported that cortical cell density is larger in females than in males, which may 
result in similar numbers of cortical cells in the two sexes (Haug, 1987). If this is the 
case, and if the proportion of cells projecting to the corpus callosum does not differ, 
it would not be surprising that callosal size and fiber numbers are no different in 
females and males.

LATERALIZATION 
There is evidence that callosal area (as seen in MRI) is inversely related to behavioral 
laterality measures (Hines, Chiu, McAdams, Bentler, & Lipcamon, 1992; Yazgan, 
Wexler, Kinsbourne, Peterson, & Leckman, 1995), supporting the concept that hemi- 
spheric specialization is associated with a decreased communication between the hemi- 
spheres. Clarke and Zaidel (1994) reported that an inverse relation between isthmus 
size and laterality holds only for males. Regarding handedness, Witelson (1985, 1989) 
found that callosal measures are larger in non-consistent right-handers than in consis- 
tent right-handers. Subsequently, Witelson and Goldsmith (1991) reported that, in 
males, the callosal isthmus was larger in nonconsistent right-handers than in consistent 
right-handers, although among females there were no differences. 
In an apparently discrepant finding, Steinmetz et al., (1992) found no differences 
in the callosal isthmus among left- and right-handers, but they classified their subjects 
as self-described dextrals and sinistrals instead of consistent or nonconsistent right- 
handers. Habib et al. (1991) found that the total size, and the size of the anterior half 
of the corpus callosum, was larger in nonconsistent than in consistent right-handed 
males; and the posterior mid-body was larger in consistent than in nonconsistent right- 
handed females. These results partially support our findings, although the possibility 
of a larger posterior mid-body in consistent right-handed females needs to be inves- 
tigated further. 
Aboitiz et al. (1992, 1992b) investigated the relations between callosal connectivity 
and hemispheric specialization, as indexed by the degree of perisylvian asymmetry. 
The Sylvian fissure was measured from Heschl's gyrus to the end of the ascending 
branch, and asymmetries in length were calculated. An inverse relation was found 
between the magnitude (i.e., regardless of direction) of these asymmetries and the size 
and fiber numbers of a specific callosal segmentmthe isthmus. As mentioned, fibers 
from perisylvian regions are believed to cross through the callosal isthmus (Witelson, 
1989). 
When separating sexes, some differences emerged. First, the inverse correlation 
between isthmus size and asymmetry was concentrated in males, a result reminiscent 
of Witelson and Goldsmith (1991) and Clarke and Zaidel (1994) in that the relation 
between asymmetry/lateralization and callosal morphology is stronger in males than 
in females, and more robust in the callosal isthmus. Second, at the level of fiber 
composition, only the isthmus of males had a significant correlation with the numbers 
of small, medium-sized, and moderately large (but not very large) callosal fibers, 
confirming the gross-morphology findings. However, in a small segment immediately 
posterior to the isthmus (the anterior third of the splenium), small and medium-sized 
fibers (and only them) had a significant negative relation to asymmetry levels only in 
females. This may indicate either a differential mapping of asymmetric regions in the 
corpus callosum of males and females, or that distinct cortical regions are asymmetric 

402 
Francisco Aboitiz and AndrOs Ide 
in the two sexes. A third alternative is that both the isthmus and anterior splenium 
include fibers connecting perisylvian areas in the two sexes, the observed difference 
resulting from sampling error due to a limited number of subjects (10 of each sex) 
and to the fact that fibers connecting perisylvian areas are only a fraction of all the 
fibers crossing through these two regions. Another intriguing result is that only in 
males, moderately large fibers (between 1 and 3 mm) correlated with asymmetry, 
perhaps indicating that in males, but not females, relatively fast interhemispheric trans- 
fer is affected by the asymmetry of language-related areas. When testing the corre- 
lation between the asymmetry levels of the different components of the Sylvian fissure 
and callosal connectivity, no significant relation was found, presumably because the 
components involve smaller cortical regions whose contribution to isthmus connectiv- 
ity is too small to be detected. 
These findings indicate that increasing asymmetry (and hence increasing hemi- 
spheric specialization for language) is associated with a decreased interhemispheric 
communication, and that perhaps there are sex differences in these relationships. If 
this hypothesis is correct, the interplay between callosal connectivity and hemispheric 
asymmetry may be of great importance during the development of language laterali- 
zation (recall that anomalous cerebral dominance may be associated with learning 
deficits such as developmental dyslexia; Galaburda, 1995). In the remainder of this 
chapter, some recent studies on developmental correlations between interhemispheric 
connectivity and hemispheric asymmetry will be reviewed. 
27-4. 
DEVELOPMENTAL 
AND 
EVOLUTIONARY 
ASPECTS 
It has been postulated that since adult callosal projections tend to be homotopical-- 
that is, connecting equivalent regions in both hemispheres (Innocenti, 1986, 1995)-- 
in asymmetric areas there will be fewer points of homotopy, which will produce a 
higher than normal process of callosal fiber retraction during development. This would 
result in a smaller amount of callosal fibers than would be the case for the same 
regions in symmetric brains (Aboitiz et al., 1992a, 1992b). Alternatively, an increased 
retraction of callosal terminals may induce the generation of hemispheric asymmetry 
and lateralization (Witelson, & Nowakowski, 1991; Witelson, 1995), presumably due 
to the emphasis on intrahemispheric processing and progressive isolation of the two 
hemispheres (Galaburda, Rosen, & Sherman, 1990; Ringo, Doty, Demeter, & Simard, 
1994). Witelson and Nowakowski (1991) found that very premature infants show a 
high proportion of left-handedness, which is interpreted as that the normal course of 
callosal axon loss has been interfered with, resulting in loss of laterality and of asym- 
metry. Supporting this view, Lassonde, Bryden, and Demers (1990) reported that 
subjects with callosal agenesis tend to be more lateralized than callosotomized and 
control subjects. However, in this proposed mechanism there is no explanation of why 
language should become lateralized to the left instead of the right; and furthermore, 

27 
Asymmetries and Corpus Callosum 
403 
anatomical asymmetries may appear earlier in development (see section 27.1.) than 
the period of callosal axon retraction, which apparently takes place between the 35th 
gestational week and the first postnatal month (Clarke, Kraftsik, van der Loos, & 
Innocenti, 1989). A likely possibility is that the two factors may reinforce each other; 
that is, after early generated anatomical asymmetries have induced an increased re- 
traction of axons in the corpus callosum, the reduced corpus callosum itself plays a 
role enhancing the incipient functional lateralization by constraining the communi- 
cation between the two hemispheres. In this way, the development of language dom- 
inance would depend on the interplay between anatomically asymmetric structures 
and their respective degree of interhemispheric communication. 
One interesting and recurrent finding is that the relations between callosal connec- 
tivity and hemispheric asymmetry tend to be stronger in males. This might imply that, 
in females, the process of perinatal reaccommodation of connectivity may not be as 
intense as in males. For example, if asymmetry determines an increased retraction of 
terminals in males, for some reason in females there might be less competition be- 
tween axons, resulting in a lack of negative correlation between asymmetry and cal- 
losal connectivity, which in turn would imply that at least for some processes, females 
might be able to tolerate a higher level of interhemispheric interaction with increasing 
hemispheric specialization than males. Perhaps sex hormones have an effect on the 
process of terminal retraction in late neural development, thus causing the proposed 
developmental differences between sexes. 
Ringo et al. (1994) proposed that in phylogeny, a longer interhemispheric delay 
due to increased brain size might produce an emphasis on local processing within 
each hemisphere, resulting in hemispheric isolation, which in turn would facilitate 
hemispheric asymmetry and lateralization. Thus, hemispheric lateralization for lan- 
guage might have partially become a by-product of having a larger brain. Jerison 
(1991) reported no differences in average callosal fiber diameter between the mouse 
and the macaque, suggesting that conduction velocity remains constant despite an 
increased interhemispheric distance, thereby effectively increasing interhemispheric 
delay in larger brains. On the other hand, preliminary findings by one of us (EA.) 
and collaborators suggest that callosal fibers tend to be thicker (and hence faster- 
conducting) in large-brained species like the cow compared to a small-brained species 
like the rat, thus compensating at least to some extent for the longer interhemispheric 
distance. Nonetheless, in Jerison's (1991) study there was a small population of large- 
diameter fibers that also increased in size and numbers from the mouse to the macaque. 
Perhaps this population of large, fast-conducting fibers tends to be concentrated in 
sensory regions that, as said, have the most stringent timing requirements (Aboitiz et 
al., 1992a). Comparing the sizes of axons connecting visual areas 17/18 in the mouse 
and the cat, Innocenti (1995) reports an increase in fiber diameter with brain size. 
Furthermore, across species no relation was found between interhemispheric conduc- 
tion delay in the 17/18 border and brain size when comparing studies performed by 
different authors (four species were compared: mouse, rabbit, cat, and monkey; In- 
nocenti, 1995). Interestingly, the shortest interhemispheric delay (antidromic stimu- 
lation) is found in the cat (between 2 and 3 msec), and the monkey has a delay 

404 
Francisco Aboitiz and AndrOs Ide 
comparable to the mouse (7 to 8 msec) despite the approximately tenfold difference 
in interhemispheric distance. The rabbit has an unusually long interhemispheric delay 
(about 17 msec). The relatively short interhemispheric delays in cat and monkey may 
relate to the fact that both are frontally eyed species with a high degree of binocularity 
and depth perception, for which fast interhemispheric conduction may be especially 
useful. This suggests that besides brain size, callosal fiber composition may also de- 
pend on behavioral and perceptual specializations such as the degree of stereopsis. 
27-5. SUMMARY 
AND CONCLUSION 
There is consensus that there are anatomical asymmetries in the human brain, and that 
these correlate with functional lateralization (especially handedness and language- 
related functions). Although sex differences in anatomical asymmetry and callosal 
structure seem to be small if they exist, in males there are apparently better structural 
correlates of lateralization as seen in anatomical asymmetry or callosal connectivity. 
Furthermore, there are indications of an inverse relation between interhemispheric 
connections and cerebral asymmetry/laterality that is more robust in males. More 
details about the asymmetric regions in the Sylvian fissure need to be worked out in 
order to determine if there is a relation between gross brain morphology and the 
arrangement of cytoarchitectonic areas, which will be of unquestionable utility for 
neurolinguistic studies that incorporate brain-imaging techniques. In order to analyze 
the interplay between the development of language lateralization and interhemispheric 
communication, studies on the development of ipsilateral/contralateral connectivity in 
animal models need to be performed, and in the human precise developmental chro- 
nologies of asymmetry and callosal structure must be established. The issue of sex 
differences in these relationships and the role of steroid and other hormones is also 
worth tackling. Furthermore, studies on individual and interspecific variation in cal- 
losal fiber composition are necessary in order to establish functional and phylogenetic 
correlates of callosal structure and its relation to brain asymmetry. In short, this is a 
newly developing field that will bring important information for neurolinguistics and 
more generally for the anatomical and neurobiological bases of hemispheric special- 
ization and interaction.

The left and right cerebral hemispheres are functionally asymmetric for certain 
aspects of language and communication. Despite the fact that the two hemi- 
spheres take the lead for different aspects of language and communication, there 
is unity in language processing. This chapter provides a brief overview of hemi- 
spheric superiority for selected aspects of language, consideration of why so many 
of these hemispheric superiorities seem to complement each other, consider- 
ation of how complementary hemispheric superiorities might emerge over the 
course of time, and discussion of various mechanisms of interhemispheric collab- 
oration that serve to unify the processing of the two hemispheres. 
There is a great deal of evidence that the left and right cerebral hemispheres are 
functionally asymmetric for certain aspects of language and communication. In this 
chapter, I note ways in which left-hemisphere and right-hemisphere dominance for 
different aspects of language and communication complement each other. For example, 
left-hemisphere dominance for speech production, phonology, and syntax is comple- 
mented by right-hemisphere dominance for intonation, emotional tone, and pragmatics.

Despite the fact that the two hemispheres take the lead for different aspects of language 
and communication, there is unity in language processing. Consequently, I also con- 
sider how it is that the two hemispheres, with their different abilities and propensities, 
collaborate with each other to permit efficient, unified processing related to language 
and communication. With these goals in mind, I begin with a brief overview of hemi- 
spheric superiority for selected aspects of language. I then consider why it is that these 
different hemispheric superiorities seem to complement each other and how comple- 
mentary hemispheric superiorities might emerge over the course of time. This is fol- 
lowed by a consideration of various mechanisms of interhemispheric collaboration. 
28-1. EXAMPLES OF HEMISPHERIC SUPERIORITY 
It is commonly stated that the left hemisphere of humans is dominant or specialized 
for linguistic, language-related processing. Although there is some truth to this asser- 
tion, it has become clear that the extent of left-hemisphere superiority is not uniform 
for all language-related functions. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the right 
hemisphere makes important contributions to the processing of language and may even 
be superior to the left for some language-related functions. In this section, I review 
some of the hemispheric asymmetries for which there is the greatest amount of con- 
verging evidence. 
Perhaps the most dramatic example of language-related laterality is left-hemisphere 
dominance for the production of overt speech, a dominance that characterizes upwards 
of 95% of right-handed individuals and 65-70% of left-handed individuals (for re- 
views, see Hellige, 1993a). In fact, this left-hemisphere dominance is so striking that 
in most cases the right hemisphere is incapable of generating overt speech (though it 
may sometimes learn to do so after left-hemisphere injury; see Kinsbourne, this vol- 
ume; Zaidel, this volume). Overt speech is such a striking aspect of language that it 
is little wonder that the left hemisphere is seen as dominant for language more gen- 
erally. 
Evidence from individuals with unilateral brain injury, from split-brain patients, 
and from neurologically intact individuals has also identified additional aspects of left- 
hemisphere dominance for language, though in most of these other cases the right 
hemisphere is not completely without ability. The left hemisphere is typically better 
than the right for the perception of speech and for other tasks that require phonetic 
processing. For example, the left hemisphere outperforms the right in tasks that require 
the ability to rhyme and in such things as naming printed words and pronounceable 
nonwords (e.g., Banich, 1995a, 1995b; Hellige, 1993a; Hellige & Cowin, 1996; Hel- 
lige, Cowin, & Eng, 1995; Rayman & Zaidel, 1991; Zaidel, this volume). Left- 
hemisphere dominance has also been demonstrated for determining whether a string 
of letters spells a word (that is, responding to words in a lexical decision task), though, 
as we shall see, certain kinds of lexical priming are greater when stimuli are presented 
to the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere is also superior to the right for dealing 

28 
Unity of Language and Communication 
407 
with syntactic information, both in the production and in the perception/understanding 
of language (see Hellige, 1993a). 
When linguistic processing is viewed in the larger context of communication, the 
right hemisphere makes significant contributions. In fact, the right hemisphere appears 
to be superior to the left for a variety of communication-related factors. Studies with 
brain-injured and intact individuals have demonstrated right-hemisphere superiority 
for the production and perception of prosody in speech (e.g., Buhlman-Flemming & 
Bryden, 1994; Van Lancker & Sidtis, 1992). Thus, the speech of patients with 
right-hemisphere injury is often said to be characterized by a monotone, lack of in- 
flection, or flat affect. In addition, dichotic listening studies show a left-ear (right- 
hemisphere) advantage for identifying such things as the emotion conveyed by a 
speaker's tone of voice (e.g., Buhlman-Flemming & Bryden, 1994). The right hemi- 
sphere also plays a role in processing what might be called the pragmatic aspects of 
language. For example, right-hemisphere damage interferes with the ability to under- 
stand certain kinds of jokes that depend on the ability to build a context across sen- 
tences that serves to make the punch line funny (e.g., Brownell, Michel, Powelson, 
& Gardner, 1983) and to process the metaphoric meanings of words such as warm 
and cold (which can refer to feelings as well as to temperature) (Brownell, Simpson, 
Bihrle, Potter, & Gardner, 1990). 
For certain aspects of language, the hemispheric asymmetries can be thought of as 
complementary. For example, it has been suggested that the left-hemisphere domi- 
nance for recognizing stop consonants (e.g., b, d, g, p, t, k) comes about because 
the left hemisphere is well adapted for processing the rapid acoustic changes over 
time that differentiate one such consonant from another (e.g., for high temporal fre- 
quency). By way of contrast, right-hemisphere dominance for recognizing emotional 
tone may come about because the right hemisphere is well-adapted for processing 
acoustic changes over a longer temporal interval (i.e., low temporal frequency). 
For review of these and other frequency-based asymmetries in audition, see Ivry 
and Robertson (1997). A second example comes from recent lexical priming stud- 
ies, which show that priming has different characteristics in the two hemispheres. A 
particularly interesting suggestion is that, when a word is presented, the left hemi- 
sphere very quickly restricts access to one possible meaning (either the dominant 
meaning or the one most consistent with the preceding words), whereas the right 
hemisphere maintains activation of many possible meanings for a longer period 
of time (e.g., Chiarello, 1995). Note that the left-hemisphere propensity would 
permit a rapid focus on the relevant meaning most of the time, whereas the right- 
hemisphere propensity would be useful for getting processing back on track if the 
meaning settled on by the left hemisphere turned out to be inappropriate in view of 
succeeding context. 
This brief review is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. Among other 
things, it illustrates that both hemispheres contribute to the use of language and com- 
munication. Furthermore, there is a sense in which at least some of these asymmetries 
complement each other. I now consider why it might make sense for the two hemi- 
spheres to develop complementary abilities.

28-2. WHY IS HEMISPHERIC 
SUPERIORITY COMPLEMENTARY? 
In recent years, examples of hemispheric asymmetry in a number of domains suggest 
that left- and right-hemisphere superiorities complement one another. For example, in 
terms of visual pattern recognition, the right hemisphere appears to be dominant for 
the processing of global characteristics of a visual pattern that are carried by visual 
channels tuned to relatively low visual spatial frequencies. By way of contrast, the 
left hemisphere appears to be dominant for the processing of local details carried by 
visual channels tuned to relatively high visual spatial frequencies (for review, see 
Hellige, 1993a, 1995, 1996; Ivry & Robertson, 1997; Kitterle, Christman, & Conesa, 
1995; Robertson, 1995). In terms of localizing visual stimuli in space, the right hemi- 
sphere appears to be dominant for processing information about metric distance or 
what has been termed coordinate spatial relations (e.g., determining whether two stim- 
uli are within 3 cm of each other), whereas the left hemisphere may be dominant for 
processing information about categorical spatial relations (e.g., whether a dot is above 
or below a line) (for review, see Hellige, 1995, 1996). In terms of motor control, the 
right hemisphere is hypothesized to be dominant for postural control, the performance 
of closed-loop movements, and for performing movements of low temporal and spatial 
frequencies. By way of contrast, the left hemisphere is hypothesized to be dominant 
for the performance of skilled activities, the performance of open-loop movements, 
and for performing movements of high temporal and spatial frequency (for review, 
see Hellige 1993a). In these cases as well as others, the neural computations that are 
well suited for one hemisphere's preferred activity may be poorly suited for the other 
hemisphere's preferred activity. 
In view of so many examples of complementary aspects of hemispheric asymmetry, 
it is important to consider what advantages might result from the assignment of com- 
plementary processing to the two cerebral hemispheres. From this perspective, it is 
interesting to consider the results from dual-task studies, which indicate that two un- 
related tasks performed simultaneously interfere with each other more when they 
require the specialized abilities of the same hemisphere than when the processing load 
can be spread moreevenly across both hemispheres (e.g., Friedman, Polson, & Dafoe, 
1988; Hellige & Longstreth, 1981; Kinsbourne & Hiscock, 1983). Such results have 
led to a variety of hypotheses about each hemisphere containing processing resources 
that are at least somewhat independent of the resources of the other hemisphere. 
According to one such view, two tasks interact with each other to the extent that the 
"functional cerebral distance" between the two is small (e.g., Kinsbourne & Hiscock, 
1983). When coupled with the view that the functional cerebral distance is typically 
greater across the two hemispheres than within a single hemisphere (perhaps because 
there are many more intrahemispheric cortical connections than there are interhemi- 
spheric connections), this accounts for the observation that two tasks interfere with 
each other more when they both require processing from within the same hemisphere. 
If this is the case, then there would seem to be some benefit from having the two 

28 
Unity of Language and Communication 
409 
hemispheres take the lead for different aspects of a complex activity (e.g., global 
versus local aspects of visual processing or pragmatic cues to understanding language 
versus syntactic and phonological cues); that is, the assignment of complementary 
processing to the two hemispheres would seem to have the advantage of allowing 
each type of processing to proceed with little interference from the other. 
The seeds of functional hemispheric asymmetry seem to be sown long before an 
individual's birth and may even date back to the ontogenetic formation of the first 
neural structures, to asymmetries of the ovum, or even to various molecular asym- 
metries. From these early origins, functional hemispheric asymmetries are shaped by 
the interaction of many biological and environmental factors. Asymmetries that are 
very small and subtle when they first emerge can eventually have profound conse- 
quences for functional hemispheric asymmetry via a kind of snowball effect. Although 
a detailed review of various developmental scenarios of this sort is beyond the scope 
of the present chapter, it is instructive to consider a few examples that have impli- 
cations for why it is that the two hemispheres become specialized for complementary 
aspects of language and communication. 
During the course of fetal development, certain areas of the right hemisphere de- 
velop somewhat earlier than homologous areas of the left hemisphere (see Geschwind 
& Galaburda, 1987; Hellige, 1993a, 1994; Hiscock, this volume). Scenarios have been 
suggested as to how certain functional asymmetries might arise from the interaction 
of these maturational gradients and the changing nature of environmental stimulation 
that reaches the brain. With respect to hemispheric asymmetry for speech, it has been 
suggested that, because of its greater maturity, the right hemisphere is more influenced 
than the left hemisphere by the impoverished auditory information that is presented 
to the brain as early as the second trimester of pregnancy (digestive sounds, the sounds 
of the mother's heartbeat, and so forth). As a result of this early influence, the right 
hemisphere is predisposed to become dominant for a variety of nonlinguistic 
soundsmincluding, perhaps, intonation and prosody. By way of contrast, the later 
developing left hemisphere is in some sense saved to become dominant for the more 
detailed information that is presented only later, as a result of the acoustic transmission 
properties of the uterus as it expands (e.g., linguistic sounds from the mother's voice 
during the last few weeks of pregnancy). As a result, the left hemisphere may be 
predisposed to become dominant for the perception as well as for the production of 
speech (for more discussion, see Hellige, 1993a, 1994; Turkewitz, 1988). 
Additional prenatal asymmetries have also been proposed to influence later func- 
tional hemispheric asymmetry for linguistic and nonlinguistic processes. For example, 
certain cranio-facial asymmetries that begin to appear during the first trimester of 
pregnancy may constitute important prenatal origins of left-hemisphere dominance for 
perceiving speech by increasing the sensitivity of the right ear to sounds in the fre- 
quency range that is typical of human speech (e.g., Previc, 1991, 1994). 
Although there is debate about the merit of these various scenarios, there is suffi- 
cient circumstantial evidence to make them worthy of additional study. In addition, 
these scenarios are consistent with the fact that neither hemisphere is completely 
dominant for all aspects of language and communication and that, instead, the two 

410 
Joseph B. Hellige 
hemispheres play complementary roles across so many domains. Such scenarios are 
also consistent with the fact that, to the extent it can be measured, hemispheric asym- 
metry is present in newborns and seems to change little over the course of childhood 
development--except as a by-product of more general cognitive development (see 
Hiscock, this volume). 
28-3. MECHANISMS OF 
INTERHEMISPHERIC COLLABORATION 
In view of the fact that there is no such thing as complete dominance of one hemi- 
sphere for all aspects of language and communication, the two hemispheres must 
collaborate to produce the full range of language processing. This being the case, it 
is important to consider how it is that the two hemispheres, with their different pro- 
cessing biases and propensities, collaborate with each other in an efficient manner. 
.With this in mind, this section provides a brief review of the mechanisms of interhemi- 
spheric collaboration. 
Investigations of the biological mechanisms that underlie interhemispheric collab- 
oration have focused on the roles of the corpus callosum and various subcortical 
structures. The corpus callosum is the largest fiber tract that connects the two hemi- 
spheres. Although there are no anatomical landmarks that divide the corpus callosum 
into discrete regions, anterior portions of the corpus callosum connect premotor and 
frontal regions of the two hemispheres, middle portions of the corpus callosum connect 
motor and somatosensory regions of the two hemispheres, and posterior regions of 
the corpus callosum connect temporal, postparietal and peristriate regions of the two 
hemispheres (e.g., Aboitiz & Ide, this volume; Witelson, 1995). Given this topographic 
structure, it is not surprising that the corpus callosum plays a significant role in the 
transfer of information from one hemisphere to the other (see Aboitiz & Ide, this 
volume; Zaidel, this volume). The integrity of the corpus callosum is particularly 
important for the transfer of explicit, conscious information about the identity of stim- 
uli presented to one hemisphere, perhaps because the corpus callosum permits inter- 
hemispheric synchronization that is critical for binding the dimensions of objects and 
experiences into a single, coherent event memory (for discussion, see Liederman, 
1995). The corpus callosum has also been hypothesized to regulate the state of asym- 
metric activation or arousal between the two hemispheres or to serve as a kind of 
barrier between the hemispheres, minimizing potentially maladaptive cross talk be- 
tween the processes for which each hemisphere is dominant (for discussion, see Hel- 
lige, 1993a; Kinsbourne & Hiscock, 1983). Recent studies that examine the relation- 
ship between functional hemispheric asymmetry and the size of regions of the corpus 
callosum are consistent with the view that the corpus callosum plays an important role 
in both the transfer of information from one hemisphere to the other and in maintaining 
some degree of isolation between the two hemispheres (e.g., Aboitiz & Ide, this vol- 
ume; Clarke, Lufkin, & Zaidel, 1993; Zaidel, Aboitiz, Clarke, Kaiser, & Matteson, 
1995). However, the mechanisms by which the corpus callosum accomplishes these 

28 
Unity of Language and Communication 
411 
two very different things are not understood and it may be difficult to do so without 
explicit computational models of hemispheric asymmetry and callosal activity (e.g., 
Chiarello & Maxfield, 1996). 
Studies with split-brain patients, whose hemispheres can no longer communicate 
via the surgically severed corpus callosum, indicate that a good deal of interhemis- 
pheric interaction can take place subcortically. Although explicit information about 
the identity of a stimulus cannot be transmitted subcortically, other types of infor- 
mation can: implicit (unconscious) information about stimulus identity, information 
about the location of objects in space, information about the categories to which a 
stimulus belongs and contextual information about an object (e.g., Liederman, 1995; 
Sergent, 1990, 1991; see also Zaidel, this volume). Subcortical structures also play a 
role in permitting each hemisphere to receive information about decisions made by 
the other hemisphere. In this way, subcortical structures may play an essential role in 
coordinating the activity of the two specialized hemispheres. 
With respect to language and communication, this system of callosal and subcor- 
tical connections permits the two hemispheres to collaborate in a variety of ways. As 
noted earlier in this chapter, the two hemispheres are dominant for different and often 
complementary aspects of language and communication. Under such conditions, each 
hemisphere is likely to take the lead for those components of processing that it handles 
best. So, for example, when listening to a fanciful tale of a neurolinguist who dreams 
about being abducted by space aliens, it is likely that the left hemisphere takes the 
lead for phonetic, syntactic, and certain semantic aspects of processing, whereas the 
right hemisphere takes the lead for processing intonation, prosodic cues to emotion, 
and pragmatic clues to meaning. Coordination of these activities requires that the 
various dimensions of the event be bound into a coherent experience and, at a func- 
tional level, involves the transfer of relevant information and decisions from one 
hemisphere to the other as well as the insulation of certain hemisphere-specific pro- 
cesses from each other so that those processes can proceed in parallel. 
The two cerebral hemispheres are capable of sharing many types of information, 
ranging from sensory input to complex decisions. However, cooperation at all levels 
does not necessarily take place all of the time. For example, when a stimulus is 
projected to only one hemisphere, it is sometimes the case that the hemisphere that 
receives the information directly carries out all of the processing. One language-related 
example of this "direct access" possibility comes from experiments that require ob- 
servers to indicate whether a string of visually presented letters spells a word (e.g., 
Zaidel et al., 1995). In fact, a variety of lexical decision experiments suggest that the 
only thing the two hemispheres may share at a functional level is the final decision 
about whether the stimulus was a word or a nonword (e.g., Hardyck, 1991). In view 
of results such as this, it is important to consider when the benefits of distributing 
processing across both hemispheres might be outweighed by the costs of interhemi- 
spheric transfer. 
With this in mind, recent studies have examined the benefits and costs of interhemi- 
spheric collaboration. In such studies, it has been useful to compare performance 
of the same task under conditions that demand interhemispheric collaboration by 

412 
Joseph B. Hellige 
presenting each hemisphere with only a portion of the total information needed to 
perform the task (the between-hemisphere condition) and conditions that present all 
of the relevant information to a single hemisphere (the within-hemisphere condition). 
For example, the task might require observers to indicate whether two simultaneously 
presented letters are identical to each other, with the two letters sometimes presented 
to the same hemisphere (the within-hemisphere condition) and sometimes presented 
to different hemispheres (the between-hemisphere condition). One important conclu- 
sion to arise from such studies is that distributing information across both hemispheres 
becomes more beneficial as the task becomes more demanding (for discussion, see 
Banich, 1995a, 1995b; Hellige, 1993a, 1993b; Liederman, 1995); that is, when pro- 
cessing demands are very simple (e.g., indicating whether two letters are physically 
identical), there is often a within-hemisphere advantage, suggesting that the costs 
associated with interhemispheric transfer are sufficiently detrimental to offset the po- 
tential benefits of interhemispheric collaboration. However, when processing demands 
are sufficiently great (e.g., indicating whether two letters of different case have the 
same name), there is typically a between-hemisphere advantage. Dividing the relevant 
input between the two hemispheres is also advantageous if it permits the hemispheres 
to engage in mutually exclusive perceptual processes (e.g., one hemisphere restricts 
processing to upright letters while the other hemisphere restricts processing to inverted 
letters). Such results suggest why it may be advantageous to have the two hemispheres 
take the lead for aspects of language and communication that are at least comple- 
mentary, if not actually mutually exclusive. 
Thus far, I have considered interhemispheric collaboration in which each hemi- 
sphere takes the lead for different components of language processing and commu- 
nication. Recent research suggests that the two hemispheres can collaborate in other 
ways as well, differing from each other with respect to how much of the interhemi- 
spheric interaction can be predicted from the processing performed by each hemi- 
sphere alone. 
An experimental paradigm that has proven useful in the study of interhemispheric 
interaction compares performance on unilateral visual half-field trials with perform- 
ance on redundant bilateral trials, on which exactly the same information is presented 
to both hemispheres. In a number of experiments, the pattern of performance on 
redundant bilateral trials has been very similar to the pattern obtained for one of the 
two unilateral visual fields (see Hellige, 1993a, 1993b). For example, when observers 
attempt to identify consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) nonword stimuli, there is a 
consistent right visual field (left-hemisphere) advantage, as would be expected for a 
task that requires phonetic processing. In addition, the pattern of errors is different 
for the two visual fields (and hemispheres). Specifically, on left visual field (right- 
hemisphere) trials, there are many more third-letter errors than first-letter errors. On 
right visual field (left-hemisphere) trials, the difference between first-letter and third- 
letter errors is reduced (even when the error types are normalized for each visual field 
to compensate for the right visual field advantage). In view of the fact that there is a 
left-hemisphere advantage for CVC identification, one might expect the error pattern 
on redundant bilateral trials to be identical to the pattern obtained on right visual field 

28 
Unity of Language and Communication 
413 
(left hemisphere) trials. Despite the intuitive nature of this expectation, the error pat- 
tern on redundant bilateral trials is actually more similar to the pattern obtained on 
left visual field (right-hemisphere) trials (e.g., Cherry, Hellige, & McDowd, 1995; 
Hellige & Cowin, 1996; Hellige, Taylor, & Eng, 1989; Hellige et al., 1995; Luh & 
Levy, 1995). In fact, in several studies, the error pattern on redundant bilateral trials 
is not significantly different from the pattern obtained on left visual field (right- 
hemisphere) trials. 
It is not clear why the error pattern obtained on redundant bilateral trials in CVC 
identification is different from that obtained on right visual field (left-hemisphere) 
trials. It has been suggested that the error pattern obtained on right visual field (left- 
hemisphere) trials reflects the operation of a phonetic mechanism that cannot be used 
by the right hemisphere. Accordingly, the processing strategy used on redundant bi- 
lateral trials may be restricted to a nonphonetic strategy that can be used by both 
hemispheres and that is ordinarily used by the right hemisphere (see Hellige & Cowin, 
1996). It has also been suggested that transmission time is faster from the right hemi- 
sphere to the left hemisphere than vice versa and for visual information carried by 
low spatial frequency channels than for visual information carried by high spatial 
frequency channels (e.g., Brown, Larson, & Jeeves, 1994; Kitterle et al., 1995). Both 
of these properties of interhemispheric transmission might contribute to increased in- 
volvement of the right hemisphere on redundant bilateral trials. At the same time, 
however, it must be noted that there are two (albeit, redundant) stimuli on bilateral 
trials and only one stimulus on each unilateral trial, and it remains to be determined 
how the number of stimuli per se might influence such things as the qualitative error 
patterns. 
Despite the fact that, in the CVC identification experiments, the results on redun- 
dant bilateral trials are somewhat counterintuitive, they can be derived from knowl- 
edge of the unilateral results. This is not always the case. For example, in a series of 
experiments that involved rhyming judgments, Banich and Karol (1992) found certain 
effects of letter font and letter case on bilateral trials that could not be predicted at 
all from the absence of such effects on unilateral trials. As Banich (1995a, 1995b) 
argues, such results indicate that interhemispheric processing can also be emergent, 
in the sense that it cannot be deduced from the sum of the parts provided by the 
single hemispheres. It will be important in future studies to examine how these emer- 
gent aspects of interhemispheric processing contribute to the unity of language and 
communication. 
28-4. FUTURE OUTLOOK 
A complete understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie language and com- 
munication must take into account the fact that the left and right cerebral hemispheres 
make different contributions. Clearly, more research is needed to refine our under- 
standing of the nature of these hemispheric asymmetries and to consider how it is that 
complementary specializations unfold over the course of ontogenetic development. It 

414 
Joseph B. Hellige 
will be particularly important to investigate the manner in which functional hemi- 
spheric asymmetries are shaped by the interaction of biological and environmental 
factors, beginning even before an individual's birth. At the same time, it will prove 
necessary to learn more about the various ways in which the two hemispheres, with 
their different processing biases and propensities, collaborate with each other to pro- 
vide a fundamental unity of language and communication. This will involve further 
studies of both the biological and the functional mechanisms of interhemispheric in- 
teraction, as well as studies of the relationship between structure and function.

The various recovery patterns of bilingual aphasic patients may be accounted for 
in terms of interference with the normal distribution of inhibitory resources. The 
differences between unilinguals and bilinguals may be only quantitative, reflect- 
ing the extended reliance on metalinguistic knowledge and/or pragmatic com- 
petence in the use of their weaker language. Also, one language (or certain items 
within a language) may be more readily available, depending on the frequency 
of their use. 
Distinctions between the linguistic and neurolinguistic levels of description, 
lexical and conceptual representations, language and verbal communication, im- 
plicit linguistic competence, and explicit metalinguistic knowledge will help our 
investigation of the complex problems posed by bilingual aphasia and the rep- 
resentation of two languages in the same brain. 
The first systematic scientific study of aphasia in bilinguals and polyglots appeared 
just over one hundred years ago (Pitres, 1895). In this monograph, Pitres reported 
that, contrary to expectation, some polyglot patients did not recover all of their lan- 
guages to the same extent. Sometimes one was recovered much sooner and/or better 
than the other, and sometimes one remained totally unavailable. Over the half century 
that followed, discussions centered on the characteristics of the languages that might

be responsible for the various types of nonparallel recovery, such as primacy (the 
native language should recover firstmRibot, 1891), familiarity (the language most 
familiar at the time of insult is recovered firstmPitres, 1895), or affect (the language 
with the greatest affective load is recovered first~Minkowski, 1928). None of these 
proposals was very successful (Paradis, 1977). 
One of Pitres' proposals that had unanimously been taken for granted (and often 
vigorously reaffirmed) for more than 80 years (that is, that the languages of a bilingual 
speaker are not each represented in a different cortical area) has more recently been 
challenged by the differential lateralization hypothesis (Vaid & Hall, 1991). As we 
shall see, the available clinical evidence is incompatible with such a hypothesis. 
Other proposals, which had gone essentially unnoticed, are being revived (for ex- 
ample, the notion of inhibition~Green, 1986; modified in terms of activation thresh- 
olds~Paradis, 1993; and neurofunctional modularity~Paradis, 1987a). Moreover, a 
number of investigations have explored the neurobiological bases of multiple language 
acquisition, storage, or processing (Jacobs, 1988; Jacobs & Schumann, 1992; Danesi, 
1994; Pulvermfiller & Schumann, 1994; Paradis, 1994; Schumann, 1994). 
29-1. RECOVERY 
PATTERNS 
Pitres (1895) had identified three types of recovery: parallel, as it came to be known, 
when both languages are recovered simultaneously and to the same extent; selective, 
when one language is never recovered; and successive, when one is recovered long 
before the other(s). He also mentioned selective aphasia, though without giving ex- 
amples, and none in fact are found in the literature until Paradis and Goldblum (1989); 
in such cases, aphasia affects only some of the languages of a polyglot. Since then, 
cases of antagonistic recovery have been described, in which the language that is 
recovered first is eventually replaced by the language subsequently recovered, so that, 
as one language improves, the other proportionately regresses and ceases to be avail- 
able. There have also been cases of blending, where the patient mixes the two lan- 
guages (sometimes at the monomorphemic word level) and is unable to speak only 
one language at a time, and cases of differential recovery, in which one language is 
recovered to a much better extent than the other, regardless of their relative premorbid 
fluency. 
In the 1970s, cases of differential aphasia, for example, Broca's aphasia in one 
language and Wernicke's aphasia in the other were reported (Albert & Obler, 1978; 
Silverberg & Gordon, 1979). However, after careful examination of the data, it seems 
that both languages exhibited agrammatism, except that in one language (Hebrew) it 
was instantiated by substitution errors, rather than omissions as the theory would have 
predicted at the time. It is now known that the symptoms of agrammatism will vary 
in accordance with the structure of each language, and that inflectional morphemes 
cannot be omitted in Hebrew. In addition, the patients in question probably had not 
mastered Hebrew quite as fully as their respective native languages before their apha- 

29 
Communication in Multilinguals 
419 
sia, which would result in lower scores on comprehension after insult. This would 
account for two of the three patients described. As to the third, reported as having 
global aphasia in Hebrew and conduction aphasia in Russian, it turns out that the 
patient had very little Hebrew at his command to begin with, and exhibited a not- 
too-counterintuitive selective recovery of Russian (with symptoms of conduction 
aphasia). 
Cases of alternating antagonistic recovery have also been reported (Paradis, Gold- 
blum, & Abidi, 1982; Nilipour & Ashayeri, 1989), where patients have access to only 
one language for alternating periods of time ranging from 1 day to 3 weeks. As well, 
cases of paradoxical translation behavior, where patients are able to translate into a 
language that, at the time, they are unable to speak spontaneously or use to name the 
simplest objects, but cannot do the reverse (that is, they are unable to translate from 
a language they understand into a language they are nevertheless able to speak spon- 
taneously and use to name objects), have been documented (Paradis et al., 1982; De 
Vreese, Motta, & Toschi, 1988). This paradoxical directional translation ability has 
also been reported in patients who were able to translate from their native to their 
second or third language, but not vice versa (Fabbro & Paradis, 1995). 
Three distinct questions can be raised with respect to patterns of recovery: (1) 
What makes these various patterns possible in the first place? That is, how are lan- 
guages represented and processed in the brain in such a manner that these various 
phenomena may occur? Then, assuming that the reason why the brain is capable of 
giving rise to all these different patterns has been identified, (2) what mechanism 
determines which of the many possible patterns will actually materialize in any given 
patient? And finally, assuming that we know what mechanism implements selective 
rather than differential or successive recovery, (3) what is responsible for English 
being recovered rather than Japanese, or French rather than Gujarati? 
In answer to the first question, Pitres argued at length against the notion of different 
cerebral locations for each of the different languages spoken by the patient. Instead, 
he proposed that, when a language is not available, it is not because its cerebral 
substrate has been physically destroyed, but because it has been weakened. In some 
form, this solution has continued to be widely accepted to this day. The weakening 
of the system can be conceived of in terms of increased inhibition, that is, of a raised 
activation threshold for the affected system. In the normal speaker, one might expect 
that the activation threshold of the unselected language is raised so as to avoid inter- 
ference. This mechanism, however, can be hindered by pathology. Thus, various lan- 
guages can be differentially inhibited, giving rise to differential recovery, temporarily 
inhibited, as in successive recovery, or permanently inhibited, as in selective recovery. 
When both languages are inhibited to the same degree, the patient exhibits parallel 
recovery. When inhibition affects one language for a period of time, and then the 
other, the patient exhibits antagonistic recovery. When one of the languages cannot 
be selectively inhibited, blending occurs. Selective aphasia (one language unimpaired, 
the other impaired) and selective recovery (one language impaired, the other un- 
available) are thus seen as two poles of a differential inhibition continuum. 

420 
Michel Paradis 
The second question has never really been addressed as such. However, an answer 
might be conceived of in terms of impairment to the control mechanism that distributes 
resources among the various language subsystems (that is, individual languages), of 
the type proposed by Green (1986). Depending on the nature of the disruption of the 
control system, resources are evenly distributed among the various languages (parallel 
recovery), or skewed toward one of the languages (differential recovery), or supplied 
to only one of the languages (selective recovery). It may also be the case that the 
supply of resources is normal for one language but reduced for the other (selective 
aphasia), or the control mechanism is unable to deactivate one of the systems (blending 
recovery), or the control mechanism that partially supplied one language system even- 
tually supplies the other one as well (successive recovery), and if over time this 
operation is reversed, it gives rise to antagonistic recovery. The nature of the control 
mechanism and hence of its possible breakdown will likely be the next focus of 
inquiry. 
The third question is the one that has been debated by far the most over the past 
century and it continues to be a matter of active investigation. Several factors have 
been proposed, although none has been able to account for most of the facts. Neither 
the native language, nor the most familiar to the patient at the time of insult, nor the 
most useful, the most affectively loaded, the language of the environment, or the last 
one used before insult, is necessarily recovered first or best (Paradis, 1977). Nor does 
it seem to be a matter of whether the two languages were acquired and used in the 
same context as opposed to acquired and/or used in different contexts, at different 
times of development. Junqu6, Vendrell, and Vendrell (1995) report on Catalan- 
Spanish bilingual aphasic patients who exhibit differential recovery even though they 
had acquired both languages from the crib and were using both equally every day 
before insult, compared to other patients who exhibited parallel recovery even though 
they had acquired one language long after the other. Sasanuma and Park (1995) also 
describe patients who underwent parallel recovery even though their languages were 
learned in quite different environments. Moreover, two languages that are structurally 
closely related (for example, Catalan and Spanish, or Korean and Japanese) can be 
recovered differentially (Junqu6 et al., 1995; Sasanuma & Park, 1995), whereas lan- 
guages structurally distant (Azari and Farsi, or English and Farsi) can be recovered 
in a parallel fashion (Nilipour, 1988). 
Given the lack of correlation between any single factor and the recovery pattern, 
researchers tended to favor a "multiple factor" view, whereby several factors might 
contribute to the recovery of one particular language over another. However, one 
reason why the answer to this question has been so elusive may be that researchers 
were looking in the wrong direction. It might be that these various factors have little 
to do with the preferential recovery of a particular language, but could be a direct 
result of the nature of the disruption of the control system (that is, the system that 
controls the distribution of resources). The activation threshold of a particular system 
(or subsystem) may be raised simply because the distributive system, for reasons 
independent of the actual language that happens to be subserved, no longer has access 
to that system (or has only reduced access).

421 
29-2. 
LATERALIZATION 
The hypothesis that language is less asymmetrically represented in the cerebral hemi- 
spheres of bilingual speakers can be interpreted as a form of differential localization 
of the two languages. If one of the languages is more extensively represented in the 
right hemisphere (RH), then it is at least partially represented in a different locus. 
This has been suggested as a possible explanation for certain nonparallel recovery 
patterns. In cases of selective or successive recovery, the recovering language might 
be more bilaterally represented than the nonrecovering language and thus be less 
severely impaired and recovered sooner (Albert & Obler, 1978). However, all the 
clinical data collected since this hypothesis was formulated contradict this possibility. 
There is no greater incidence of crossed aphasia in bilingual than in unilingual pop- 
ulations (Chary, 1986; Karanth & Rangamani, 1988; Rangamani, 1989) and the evi- 
dence from Wada testing, electrical stimulation of the brain, and PET scans confirms 
that both languages are represented in the left hemisphere (LH) in bilingual individuals 
(Rapport, Tan, & Whitaker, 1983; Klein, Zatorre, Milner, Meyer, & Evans, 1995). 
Yet this has been one of the most controversial and most discussed issues of the 
past 2 decades. At first it was proposed that the languages of bilinguals (in general) 
were less lateralized than the language of unilinguals. Since studies kept failing to 
show any difference between the lateralization pattern of bilinguals and unilinguals, 
the hypothesis was gradually restricted to smaller and smaller subpopulations of bi- 
linguals: only bilinguals who have not acquired their languages concurrently; only in 
the initial stages of second language acquisition; only in the initial stages, provided 
that the second language is acquired informally. Not only were none of these findings 
replicated, but some experimenters found differential lateralization in the direction 
opposite to the predictions of these age, stage, and manner hypotheses, for example, 
at the later stages of the formal learning of a second language. Meanwhile, about half 
the studies continued to find language to be represented no less asymmetrically in 
bilinguals than in unilingual controls. 
These discrepancies have mostly been attributed to subtle differences in method, 
task, or stimulus characteristics (Vaid & Hall, 1991). This line of argument implies 
that some specific procedures will yield results indicative of greater RH participation 
whereas others will not. One is then left with the problem of deciding which of these 
subtle methodological differences are actually tapping into what they purport to be 
tapping into, and which are not, since different but equally valid procedures would 
not be expected to yield incompatible results. In the absence of a consensus on the 
matter, and given that the same technique (for example, dichotic listening or tachis- 
toscopic visual half-field presentation) can produce contradictory resultsmwhich, in- 
cidentally, as we have seen, run counter to all the available clinical evidencemit is 
more likely that the experimental paradigms employed to measure language laterali- 
zation in individuals and subpopulations are not measuring what they purport to mea- 
sure. And, in point of fact, this had already been demonstrated at the time these studies 
began to be popular (Satz, 1977). The acknowledgment that their experiments are 
"based on impoverished measures," that their stimuli are "hardly representative" of 

422 
Michel Paradis 
what they attempt to measure (that is, language), that their technique is "subject to 
many criticisms," and that "no suitable monolingual control group" can be found for 
their bilingual experimental sample does not, however, prevent some experimenters 
from continuing to conduct and publish such experiments (Richardson & Wuillemin, 
1995). 
The contradictions among experimental studies may be intensified by the fact that 
experimenters fail to specify what they mean by "language," that is, what it is that 
they suspect of being less lateralized in bilinguals. If they mean implicit linguistic 
competence, they are demonstrably wrong. All the evidence gathered to date points 
to both languages being represented in the language areas of the LH, in the same 
proportion as in unilinguals. If they mean communicative competence, including prag- 
matics, they are probably right, but the experimental procedures they use, by their 
very rationale, could not possibly speak to the issue. Indeed, it is difficult to see how 
a subject's response to the tachistoscopic presentation of single four-letter words or 
the dichotic presentation of digits could possibly be indicative of the use of pragmatic 
strategies in the processing of utterances in situational contexts. 
On the basis of studies of communication deficits subsequent to RH lesions (Brow- 
nell, Gardner, Prather, & Martino, 1995), one can safely assume that the RH is cru- 
cially involved in the processing of pragmatic aspects of language use. Given that 
second language speakers, like children, are likely to compensate for the gaps in their 
implicit linguistic competence in their weaker language by increasing their reliance 
on pragmatic inferences, it is to be expected that they will involve their right hemi- 
spheres to a correspondingly greater extent. Increased RH involvement in these cases, 
however, does not reflect the representation or processing of the language system 
(implicit linguistic competence) but, on the contrary, of whatever nonlinguistic com- 
petence is substituted for it. 
29-3. BILINGUAL 
VERSUS 
UNILINGUAL 
REPRESENTATION 
AND 
PROCESSING 
When one language has not been fully mastered, the speaker may resort to compen- 
satory mechanisms in order to interpret and formulate sentences. These may be of at 
least two sorts: metalinguistic knowledge and pragmatic competence. The differences 
between unilinguals and bilinguals, or between the stronger and the weaker language 
of a bilingual, may be quantitative, simply reflecting the extended reliance on either 
metalinguistic knowledge or pragmatic competence, or both, in the use of the weaker 
language. Also, one language (or certain items within a language) may be more readily 
available, depending on the frequency of use, just as some items are more or less 
readily available to unilinguals, for the same reason. 
There is no verbal function available to the bilingual speaker that does not have 
its homologue in the unilingual speaker. B ilinguals switch languages, unilinguals 
switch registers (which implies a change of vocabulary, morphosyntax, and in some 
cases even phonology). Bilinguals mix their languages intrasententially and borrow 

29 
Communication in Multilinguals 
423 
words from the other language, unilinguals mix their registers and borrow words from 
other registers (either in jest or as a result of interference, just as bilinguals do). 
B ilinguals are able to translate from one of their languages into the other, unilinguals 
may paraphrase an utterance from one register into another, or even within the same 
register (that is, say more or less the same thing with different words and different 
syntactic structures). There is therefore no need to postulate neural mechanisms spe- 
cific to bilinguals. 
In our comparisons between bilingual and unilingual speakers, we must carefully 
distinguish between the contents of representations (that is, what is represented, the 
language system with its phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical-semantic com- 
ponents, as well as pragmatic aspects, including sociolinguistic registers and the ap- 
propriateness of using specific items in particular circumstances, also proverbs, con- 
ventional metaphors, and indirect speech acts) on the one hand, and the cerebral 
organization of representations on the other. The contents necessarily differ from one 
language to the next (obviously, implicit linguistic competence in Korean is not the 
same as implicit competence in English). The contents even differ among bilinguals 
speaking the "same" pair of languages. (Of course, to the extent that their grammar 
deviates from the native pattern, one might argue that they do not really speak the 
language [Paradis, 1993b], but that is not important here.) Given that the grammar 
(including the lexicon) of few, if any, bilingual speakers is identical in all respects 
with that of unilingual speakers of the respective languages, and that the deviances 
from the unilingual norm are different in different individuals as a result of the context 
of acquisition/learning and/or use, the actual contents of the representations of the 
languages will differ among bilinguals, according to their degree of mastery of each 
aspect of grammar and pragmatic competence for each language. 
The way the two grammars (and all other aspects of verbal communication) are 
organized in the brain, however, need not depend on the internal structure of each 
grammar. In other words, whether or not (and to what extent) one or both languages 
are affected by what is linguistically described as interference in their contents is 
independent of whether the two language systems are represented in the brain as one 
extended system for language; as two distinct systems; as one common system for 
whatever the two languages have in common (whether legitimately or not), and sep- 
arate systems for what is unique to each language (different phonemes, stress patterns, 
morphosyntax, lexical-semantic constraints, etc.); as two language-specific subsystems 
within the language system (Paradis, 1987b); or any other manner in which two lan- 
guages may happen to be represented in the human brain. 
Although no qualitative differences need exist between unilinguals and bilinguals 
and between various types of bilinguals with regard to how languages are processed, 
extensive quantitative differences in the use of the various cerebral mechanisms in- 
volved in verbal communication may nevertheless result from (1) differences in the 
degree of mastery of the two languages, (2) the age at which the second language has 
been acquired, and (3) the degree of motivation in acquiring the second language. 
To the extent that linguistic competence in one language is incomplete, speakers, 
like unilingual children during their first years of language acquisition, have to rely 

424 
Michel Paradis 
on (presumably right hemisphere-based) pragmatic processing in order to derive an 
interpretation for utterances in that language whose automatic linguistic processing 
has not yet been fully internalized. (Note that this increased RH participation could 
not, by definition, be revealed by procedures explicitly devised to measure laterali- 
zation of the language system [that is, implicit linguistic competence, the grammar]. 
If these procedures [dichotic listening, tachistoscopic visual half-field presentations, 
dihaptic tasks] were sensitive to pragmatic processing, it would be a demonstration 
that they were measuring something other than what they purport to measure--in 
other words, that they were not valid.) 
Independently, second language learners may also obtain extensive metalinguistic 
knowledge about their second language in the form of explicit pedagogical grammar 
rules. Like any native speaker who has obtained such knowledge at school, they may 
consciously process sentences, though to a much greater extent than in their native 
language and than unilinguals, in order to compensate for their lack of automatic 
implicit competence in their weaker language. To the extent that they control their 
production, they engage their declarative memory system (when their procedural mem- 
ory for language fails them), and thereby engage a particular neural substrate to a 
greater extent (Paradis, 1994). 
There are also indications that speakers who have acquired their second languages 
after a certain age (that is, about 7) process functional categories (closed-class words) 
in the same way as lexical categories, whereas unilinguals and early bilinguals process 
them differently (Weber-Fox & Neville, 1996). This might be due to a decrease in the 
capacity of procedural memory to acquire implicit linguistic competence with age, 
and learners may consequently have to rely to a greater extent on declarative aspects 
(vocabulary being one of them--Paradis, 1994). Function words may then be learned 
as lexical items, with a sound and a particular meaning, rather than as a structural 
form within the implicit grammar. This process is probably not very different from 
the way genetic dysphasics learn inflectional morphology in their native language 
(Paradis & Gopnik, 1994). We may thus eventually have to distinguish between (early) 
bilinguals and fluent second language speakers. The ERP evidence (Weber-Fox & 
Neville, 1996) points to a neurofunctional processing difference. If our speculation 
that it may reflect a difference in the type of memory system involved turns out to 
be correct, then we may also have a difference at the level of the neural substrates 
involved in unilinguals and early bilinguals, on the one hand, and fluent second lan- 
guage speakers (or late bilinguals), on the other. 
29-4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN THE 
NEUROPSYCHOLOGY 
OF BILINGUALISM: 
THE NEED FOR DISTINCTIONS 
Too often, investigators of the organization of two or more languages in one brain in 
general, and of aphasia in bilinguals and polyglots in particular, have suffered the 
consequences of a failure to make a number of distinctions, namely, between (a) the 

29 
Communication in Multilinguals 
425 
linguistic and neurolinguistic levels of description (or domains of discourse); (b) lex- 
ical and conceptual representations; (c) language qua grammar (or system or code) 
and language qua verbal communication (the grammar plus pragmatics); (d) implicit 
linguistic competence and explicit metalinguistic knowledge; and (e) quantitative ver- 
sus qualitative differences. Once these distinctions are taken into consideration, one 
realizes that the many controversies can be resolved. This goes a long way toward 
ending the state of confusion that has led to numerous contradictory claims concerning 
language laterality in bilinguals, the number of lexical stores, and cerebral represen- 
tation and processing in various types of bilingual speakers, to mention only a few of 
the issues that have mobilized the energies of psychologists and neurologists inves- 
tigating bilingualism over the last two decades. 
29-4.1. Linguistic and Neurolinguistic Levels of Description 
The organization of the neural substrate has often been mistakenly supposed to be 
modified in some way as a consequence of the differential organization of language 
structure. Compound organization of an individual's linguistic system, whereby ele- 
ments of the two languages are blended or fused (a linguistic construct), has thus been 
assumed to necessarily entail a cerebral organization (a neurolinguistic construct) that 
would differ from that of individuals with a system in which elements of the two 
languages retain their respective unilingual integrity. Although the contents of the 
grammar may differ from one language to the next and from one bilingual speaker to 
another (according fo the degree and kind of deviation from the unilingual norm in 
each language), there is nevertheless no necessary effect on the neural underpinnings 
of the grammar, and so far none has been documented. Although the internal struc- 
ture of the blended grammar may differ, there is no reason why it should not be sub- 
served by the brain as a grammar, irrespective of its specific contents and hence 
irrespective of the number of illicit borrowings or blends incorporated into it. 
As we have seen, there is no evidence from aphasia to support the hypothesis that 
bilinguals who have acquired both their languages concurrently, in the same environ- 
ment, store their languages in ways that are more neurofunctionally similar, whereas 
those who have learned their second language in a different context from the first 
store their two languages in more neurofunctionally separate ways. 
One linguistic consequence of early bilingualism in some individuals may be a 
systematic deviation from the unilingual norm at some or all levels of language rep- 
resentation (for example, some degree of compoundness in voice onset time or vowel 
quality, or the idiosyncratic use of a particular preposition in some contexts) without 
any consequence for the manner in which the grammar is subserved by its neural 
substratum. There is no reason to believe that the brain should process legitimate 
elements in one way and illegitimate ones in another. Blends are processed as if they 
were legitimate elements, as long as they are treated as such by the speakers and have 
been incorporated into their implicit linguistic competence. The legitimacy of an el- 
ement is often a mere historical accident. For example, the actual number of elements 
shared between English and French is a result of such historical accidentsmit is not 

426 
Michel Paradis 
necessary and could easily have been different. In fact, it continues to change in our 
own lifetime. 
Linguistic and neurolinguistic domains of discourse bear on objects that are of a 
different nature, and hence the particular form of the linguistic elements has no bearing 
on the neural principles that govern the related substrate and vice versa. Future re- 
search in language sciences will have to explicitly state whether the hypothetical 
constructs that are proposed and the claims that are made concern the language system 
(the linguistic level of description), the use of mental representations in real time (the 
psycholinguistic level), or the underlying neural mechanisms and structures (the neu- 
rolinguistic level). Any claim that the content/form of elements at one level of rep- 
resentation has a direct influence on the structure and operations of another level will 
have to be logically or empirically demonstrated. 
29-4.2. Lexical and Conceptual Representations 
Another source of confusion has been a neglect to distinguish between lexical semantic 
constraints and nonlinguistic mental representations, or concepts. For the last four 
decades, experimental psychologists have investigated whether bilingual speakers pos- 
sess two linguistic memory stores or one. 
The various experimental studies attempting to ascertain the number of linguistic 
memory stores were all based on the following general rationale. If subjects responded 
to translation equivalents in the same way as they responded to the repetition of the 
stimulus word, results were interpreted as supportive of the one-store hypothesis. If 
they responded to translation equivalents in the same way as they responded to alto- 
gether different words in the same language as the stimuli, results were interpreted as 
supporting the two-store hypothesis. Some experiments claimed to support the two- 
store hypothesis, others were construed as supporting the one-store hypothesis, while 
some supported neither, as the subjects' responses were too different for a one-store 
explanation but not different enough for a two-store account. However, these contra- 
dictory results are uninterpretable because these studies suffered from a triple lack of 
distinctions: (1) between different types of semantic organization in their bilingual 
subjects' lexicon; (2) between stimuli that inherently have considerable overlap in 
meaning between languages and those that only have minimal degree of overlap; and 
(3) between semantic and conceptual levels of representation (lexical-semantic rep- 
resentations versus nonlinguistic mental representations). 
The results were thus partly a function of linguistic rather than psycholinguistic 
criteria: they varied according to the degree of overlap in meaning between the stim- 
ulus words and their translation equivalent. The more extensive the overlap in mean- 
ing, the greater the chances that the translation equivalent would trigger the same 
response as a repetition of the initial stimulus; the less extensive the overlap, the 
greater the chances that it would trigger a different response. These differences can 
be exacerbated by an increased overlap in meaning in the lexicon of subjects with a 
compound and subordinate set of lexical meanings. This is also true in the case of 
priming in current lexical decision studies. Results tend to vary based on subjects' 

29 
Communication in Multilinguals 
427 
degree of fluency (generally correlated to a great extent with subordinate organization 
of the lexicon) and structural distance between languages (that is, the degree of in- 
herent overlap). 
One of the major problems, with many ramifications, has been the failure to dis- 
tinguish between the meaning of words and nonlinguistic mental representations. The 
semantic field of each word is determined by language-specific constraints on its 
possible uses. Words share some but not all of the semantic features of their translation 
equivalents and will therefore not denote all of the same referents. The mental rep- 
resentation that corresponds to a word will thus differ to some extent from the mental 
representation corresponding to its translation equivalent. But clinical evidence has 
shown that the speaker has a third, language-independent system that contains con- 
ceptual representations. During language comprehension or production, the mental 
representations are organized (that is, conceptual features are grouped together) in 
accordance with the lexical semantic constraints peculiar to the selected language 
system. This third cognitive system, phylogenetically and ontogenetically anterior to 
the language system(s), is independent of language and hence of the bilingual's two 
languages, and remains available to the aphasic patient (Lecours & Joanette, 1980). 
Even though an aphasic patient may have lost access to the words cupcake, brioche, 
and muffin, that person may nevertheless go to the store and buy a muffin, not a 
cupcake (that is, the person has the concept, whether or not he or she is able to 
verbalize it). 
We should thus distinguish between the lexical meanings of words, a part of the 
speaker's linguistic competence (a component of the lexical item, like its syntactic 
features and phonological form) and hence vulnerable to aphasia, and conceptual rep- 
resentations that are outside of implicit linguistic competence and thus are not vul- 
nerable to aphasia (though they are vulnerable to other forms of mental disruption). 
The conceptual system, where messages are elaborated before they are verbalized in 
the course of the encoding process, and where a mental representation is attained at 
the end of the decoding process, remains independent and isolable from the language 
systems. 
The form of any aspect of the grammar (phonology, morphosyntax, lexical-semantic 
features--a linguistic construct) may be the result of language contact, but once it 
has been internalized as implicit linguistic competence, there is no indication that it 
is not represented in the mind (a psycholinguistic construct) or in the brain (a neu- 
rolinguistic construct) in the same manner as any other linguistic system. The con- 
text of acquisition may influence the content of a grammar and the context of use 
may influence the availability of some of its elements, but they have no influence 
on the principles by which brain mechanisms store and process these elements. Fu- 
ture research will likely concentrate on identifying, in bilingual speakers, the cere- 
bral areas and mechanisms involved in the processing of lexical items versus their 
conceptual representation, teasing apart what is language-specific and hence part of 
the linguistic system, as opposed to what is conceptual and hence independent of 
the linguistic system, possibly along the lines of research developed by Damasio 
(1989).

29-4.3. Grammar and Pragmatics 
Before the claim can be made that the RH is involved to a greater extent in the 
language functions of bilinguals than of unilinguals, it is necessary to distinguish 
between implicit linguistic competence (that is, phonology, morphology, syntax, and 
the lexicon) on the one hand, and pragmatic aspects of language use (for example, 
reliance on inferences from situational context, general knowledge, emotional prosody, 
facial expressions, and so forth) on the other. All clinical studies to date unambigu- 
ously point to the fact that implicit linguistic competence is subserved by areas of the 
LH of right-handed bilinguals in the same proportion as in unilinguals. As we have 
seen, there is also increasing evidence from RH lesion studies to the effect that prag- 
matic and paralinguistic aspects of language use are subserved by areas of the RH. 
The failure to differentiate between grammar and pragmatics has resulted in a series 
of controversies as to whether there is greater participation by the RH in processing 
language in bilinguals than in unilinguals. The answer seems to be an unqualified 
"yes" or "no," depending on what one means by "language." Some bilinguals, like 
some unilinguals, may process some of their grammar in their RH and show subtle 
morphosyntactic and/or phonological deficits subsequent to a RH lesion (Joanette, 
Lecours, Lepage, & Lamoureux, 1983). But there is no clinical evidence (such as a 
greater incidence of crossed aphasia) or neuropsychological evidence (for example, 
from Wada testing or electrical stimulation of the brain) that would indicate greater 
participation. If, however, "language" refers to the normal use of language, including 
pragmatics, then the answer is a qualified "yes"monly in the case of the use of a 
weaker language. 
As far as the experimental evidence is concerned, a meta-analysis (Vaid & Hall, 
1991) has failed to come up with a difference between unilinguals and bilinguals and 
most researchers have finally abandoned this fruitless search for a differential cerebral 
asymmetry. This does not mean that bilinguals cannot rely to a greater extent on RH- 
based pragmatic features when using their weaker language. Future research is likely 
to examine the extent of pragmatic compensation in the use of any weaker language 
by bilingual speakers with methods inspired by studies of RH involvement in language 
use in unilinguals. 
29-4.4. Linguistic Competence and Metalinguistic Knowledge 
It is equally important to distinguish between implicit linguistic competence and me- 
talinguistic knowledge. The former is acquired incidentally, is stored in the form of 
procedural know-how without conscious knowledge of its contents, and is used au- 
tomatically. The latter is learned consciously, is available for conscious recall, and is 
applied to the production (and comprehension) of language in a controlled manner. 
Implicit linguistic competence is acquired through interaction with speakers of the 
language in situational contexts. Metalinguistic knowledge is usually learned through 
formal instruction. The extent of metalinguistic knowledge about one's native language 

29 
Communication in Multilinguals 
429 
is by and large proportional to one's degree of education. Very often, a foreign lan- 
guage is learned almost exclusively through metalinguistic knowledge and whatever 
linguistic competence develops subsequently does so through practice of the language 
in communicative situations. If implicit linguistic competence is what is affected by 
aphasia, given that explicit knowledge is ordinarily not impaired in aphasic patients, 
it is not unreasonable to expect that metalinguistic knowledge, together with all other 
items of episodic and encyclopedic declarative memory, should remain available to 
aphasic patients. Some patients may have been exposed to much more explicit me- 
talinguistic knowledge during the learning of a foreign language than during the ac- 
quisition of their native language. Some may, in fact, have been schooled entirely in 
a second language, while continuing to use the first language only in the home, thus 
remaining illiterate in, and having little metalinguistic knowledge about, that language. 
As a result, in such individuals, metalinguistic knowledge about their second and 
possibly weaker language may be more extensive than about their native language. 
Subsequent to aphasia, they may lose access to their implicit linguistic competence 
equally in both languages but nevertheless retain full access to their metalinguistic 
knowledge which, being more extensive in their nonnative language, may give the 
impression of a preferential recovery of the language that was the least fluent before 
insult. In reality, however, even though implicit linguistic competence is equally im- 
paired in both languages, these patients simply have more metalinguistic knowledge 
to fall back on in their weaker language. The fact that they speak slowly, control their 
production consciously, and keep asking their interlocutor to slow down and/or repeat 
may go unnoticed, since the patients, being aphasic, are expected to speak more ef- 
fortfully anyhow. Future research is likely to investigate this compensatory mechanism 
and its impact on language recovery and rehabilitation. 
29-5. CONCLUSIONS 
The neuropsychology of bilingualism over the past two decades has concentrated on 
various attempts to explain the diversity of recovery patterns in terms of models of 
language representation and processing. Two issues in particular have monopolized 
much of the literature: differential hemispheric asymmetry and differential localization 
within the dominant hemisphere. The ontological status of the claims investigators 
make must be clarified, namely, whether they are intended as descriptive metaphors 
(like the various characterizations of implicit linguistic competence) or as descriptions 
of the actual state of affairs in the real world in real time; or, in other words, whether 
these claims are about the linguistic or neurolinguistic level of description. We must 
also distinguish between the language-specific meaning of words and nonlinguistic 
mental representations. Finally, we need to distinguish between implicit linguistic 
competence and pragmatic aspects of language use, and between explicit metalin- 
guistic knowledge and implicit linguistic competence. Once that has been accom- 
plished, we will be in a better position to examine the complex problems posed by 

430 
Michel Paradis 
aphasia in bilinguals and polyglots and by the representation and processing of two 
languages in the same brain. The systematic collection of data from bilingual aphasic 
patients with instruments that are equivalent in each of their languages will greatly 
facilitate the process. New imaging techniques, in particular fMRI and ERP studies 
of bilingual populations, should also help us identify the cerebral mechanisms involved 
in the various language functions of bilingual speakers.

The Role of Subcortical Structures 
in Linguistic Processes 
Recent Developments

Florida, 32610 
With infarction or hemorrhage of the dominant basal ganglia, cortical dysfunc- 
tion due to hemodynamic factors accounts for the more prominent language 
symptoms. At best, cortical symptoms obscure a minor role for the basal ganglia 
in language. If this role exists, it is a supportive, as opposed to a primarily lin- 
guistic, one. On the other hand, dominant thalamic nuclei appear to play a role 
at the lexical-semantic interface, explaining semantic paraphasias commonly seen 
in thalamic aphasia. The frontal lobes, inferior thalamic peduncle, nucleus re- 
ticularis, and perhaps centromedian nucleus may be involved in selective en- 
gagement of cortical mechanisms that subserve this interface. Other phenomena 
after dominant thalamic lesion include category-specific naming deficits and ne- 
glect dyslexia. Such findings raise the possibility that the thalamus has multiple 
functions that support language. 
Interest in the role of subcortical structures in language has been evident for more 
than a century. Wallesch and Papagno (1988) traced the concept of subcortical aphasia 
as far back as Broadbent (1872), who believed that the basal ganglia were the struc- 
tures in which words were generated as motor acts. As in more recent times, this 
position was not held by all. Kussmaul (1877) assigned a strictly motor function to 
the basal ganglia. Even Carl Wernicke (1874), who, along with Broca and Lichtheim,

Bruce Crosson and Stephen E. Nadeau 
can be considered a founder of modern aphasiology, discussed the function of the 
basal ganglia in language. Marie and his students (Marie, 1906, cited by D6monet, 
1987; Moutier, 1908, cited by Wallesch & Papagno, 1988) believed the basal ganglia 
were involved in language. Regarding the thalamus, Penfield and Roberts (1959) sug- 
gested that it played an integrative role in language. Schuell, Jenkins, and Jimenez- 
Pabon (1965) speculated that the thalamus was involved in preverbal feedback about 
the adequacy of formulated responses. Thus, some of the more notable names in the 
history of aphasiology have endeavored to discern the role of subcortical structures 
in language. 
However, it was not until the advent of the X-ray computerized tomography (CT) 
scan, and later magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), that serious consideration of sub- 
cortical structures in language emerged. These imaging techniques have allowed us 
to visualize and localize subcortical lesions. It was discovered that when located in 
the dominant hemisphere, subcortical lesions were frequently accompanied by aphasia. 
Stereotactic surgery studies, mostly on Parkinson's disease patients, have yielded stim- 
ulation and lesion data that have played a lesser, but important, role in fueling theories 
of subcortical functions in language. In the last decade, significant advances have been 
made that are contributing to our understanding of the role of subcortical functions 
in language. In this chapter, we will endeavor to address these advances, first for the 
basal ganglia and then for the thalamus. For each of these anatomic regions, we will 
provide a brief theoretical history, then discuss recent advances, and finally raise issues 
for future consideration. Our focus will be primarily theoretical, and because of space 
limitations, our review will be somewhat selective. For those readers wishing further 
detail, we cite reviews that can be perused. 
30-1. ROLE 
OF THE BASAL 
GANGLIA 
IN LANGUAGE 
30-1.1. Historical Perspective on Theory 
Numerous studies in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s implicated the basal ganglia in 
language (see Crosson, 1992). Although studies of large hemorrhages into the basal 
ganglia were flawed because they failed to take into account the potential pressure 
effects on surrounding structures, numerous studies of infarction in the basal ganglia 
of the dominant hemisphere also described aphasia. This phenomenon encouraged 
speculation about the role of the basal ganglia in language. Nonetheless, studies of 
infarction were not flawless, in part because they typically involved surrounding white 
matter structures. 
Divergent theoretical positions have appeared regarding the role of the basal ganglia 
in language. Alexander, Naeser, and Palumbo (1987) suggested that the basal ganglia 
were not involved in langauge. They explained the aphasia accompanying basal gan- 
glia infarction as due to damage to white matter pathways surrounding the basal 
ganglia that interconnect important language-related structures. Crosson (1985, 1992) 

30 
Subcortical Structures in Language 
433 
proposed a different explanation for aphasia after dominant basal ganglia lesions. He 
thought that language segments were formulated anteriorly and held in a buffer until 
they could be semantically verified by posterior mechanisms used in language decod- 
ing. The role of the basal ganglia was to provide a signal initiating the release of the 
formulated language segment for motor programming once it had been semantically 
verified. Notice that this proposal does not posit that the basal ganglia process lin- 
guistic features in order to accomplish this role. Their role is simply to trigger the 
release of language segments from the buffer for the purpose of motor programming. 
Finally, Wallesch and Papagno (1988) suggested that the basal ganglia were involved 
in monitoring multiple cortically generated lexical alternatives in order to select the 
one best meeting semantic and motivational constraints. Recent evidence, however, 
suggests a different origin of language problems accompanying dominant basal ganglia 
lesions. 
30-1.2. Recent Developments 
30-1.2.1. Relationship of Aphasia after Dominant Basal Ganglia 
Infarction to Hemodynamic Factors 
The problem with all these hypotheses relates to the variability in aphasia syndromes 
observed after infarction of dominant basal ganglia structures. Crosson (1992) re- 
viewed numerous studies of infarction of various portions of the dominant basal gan- 
glia. No matter which specific parts of the basal ganglia were involved in the lesion, 
no definable aphasia syndrome emerged. To some degree, this analysis was flawed 
because, in most of the studies, lesions involved multiple basal ganglia structures, as 
well as surrounding white matter pathways. Nadeau and Crosson (1997), therefore, 
took a slightly different approach to analyzing this problem. Their review of cases 
from the literature addressed only dominant striatocapsular infarctions, which have a 
characteristic comma-shaped appearance and invariably involve the head of the cau- 
date nucleus, the putamen, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and perhaps some 
of the globus pallidus. Because the anatomic structures involved are relatively con- 
sistent, some consistency of aphasic symptoms would be expected if any of these 
structures are involved in specific language processes. No such consistent pattern of 
language symptoms could be found. Aphasias after this type of lesion could be fluent 
or nonfluent, could involve significant comprehension deficits or no comprehension 
deficits, might or might not involve impairment of repetition, and so on. Further, there 
were a significant number of cases in which dominant striatocapsular infarction was 
accompanied by no language symptoms. This evidence mitigates against a specific 
role in language for these structures, and an alternative explanation for aphasia after 
dominant basal ganglia lesions must be sought. 
A series of studies by investigators in cerebrovascular disease, most notably that 
of Weiller et al. (1993), have shed light on this issue. These authors found that stria- 
tocapsular lesions were caused by occlusion of the initial segment of the dominant 
middle cerebral artery (MCA), or occasionally by occlusion of the internal carotid 

434 
Bruce Crosson and Stephen E. Nadeau 
artery (ICA). The presence of significant aphasia after dominant basal ganglia infarc- 
tion was determined by two factors: (1) how early the MCA recanalized and (2) 
adequacy of anastomotic circulation. Significant aphasia was found primarily in cases 
of late recanalization and inadequate anastomotic circulation. Thus, these findings 
suggest that circulatory dynamics play a crucial role in language symptoms after 
dominant basal ganglia infarction. 
Nadeau and Crosson (1997) have explained these circulatory dynamics in some 
detail (Figure 1). The reader is referred to this review for the specifics, but the essen- 
tials are as follows: Because striatocapsular infarction is caused primarily by occlusion 
of the initial segment of the MCA or occasionally by occlusion of the ICA, the entire 
circulation of the MCA is at risk. This circulation includes the perisylvian cortex 
essential for language functions. The adequacy of anastomotic circulation to various 
areas of cortex determines the impact of MCA or ICA occlusion on cortex in the

MCA circulation; however, the position of the occlusion frequently prevents anasto- 
motic circulation from supplying the infarcted subcortical territory. When anastomotic 
circulation for a particular cortical region is grossly inadequate, cystic infarction of 
the cortex as well as the basal ganglia occurs. In this case, the cortical damage is 
clearly visualized on CT or MRI scans. However, inadequate anastomotic circulation 
can cause two other states that will impair function but will not be visualized on 
structural brain imaging. First, blood flow may not be so compromised that cystic 
infarction occurs, but it may be compromised enough that ischemic neuronal dropout 
takes place. Second, circulation may not be so compromised as to cause ischemic 
neuronal dropout, but it may be compromised enough that normal tissue function is 
impossible. These conditions will have the effect of permanently or temporarily caus- 
ing dysfunction Of the affected cortical regions. The nature of the language symptoms 
is dependent on which areas of language cortex are compromised in this way. Which 
cortical regions are compromised is dependent on the adequacy of their anastomotic 
circulation. In basal ganglia hemorrhage, Nadeau and Crosson (1997) have also noted 
circulatory dynamics that affect the cortex and thereby play a role in the presenting 
symptoms. In such instances, the authors noted that pressure-induced ischemia causes 
cortical dysfunction, which results in aphasic symptoms. 
Thus, Nadeau and Crosson (1997) concluded that any role of the dominant basal 
ganglia in language is at best obscured by cortical dysfunction in cases of basal ganglia 
infarction or hemorrhage, and probably is minimal or nonexistent. Other reviewers 
have reached similar conclusions regarding the lack of basal ganglia functions in 
language. For example, Bhatia and Marsden (1994) reviewed 240 cases of basal gan- 
glia lesions. In instances where lesions appeared confined to a single structure of the 
basal ganglia, significant speech or language deficit was very infrequently found for 
the caudate nucleus (2 of 43), putamen (1 of 20), or globus pallidus (1 of 17). Thus, 
much recent evidence suggests the basal ganglia play no major, direct role in language 
processes. 
30-1.2.2. Syntax Comprehension Deficits in Parkinson's Disease 
One possible exception to this conclusion is the complex syntax comprehension def- 
icits noted by Grossman and his colleagues, as well as others, in Parkinson's disease 
(PD) patients (for example, Grossman et al., 1991; Grossman, Carvell, Stern, Gollomp, 
& Hurtig, 1992; Lieberman, et al., 1992). Major impairment of mesostriatal dopamine 
pathways in PD significantly affects putamen and caudate nucleus functions. Gross- 
man et al. (1992) noted that a variety of grammatic factors were correlated with overall 
sentence comprehension problems in PD patients, but performance on sentences re- 
quiring greater working memory was also correlated with general sentence compre- 
hension. Lieberman et al. (1992) found that PD patients with voice onset timing 
deficits had more syntactic comprehension errors than PD patients without voice onset 
timing deficits in speech. At this time, it is still uncertain whether syntax processing 
deficits in PD patients represent a primary linguistic processing deficit or are due 
to other underlying cognitive dysfunction, such as working memory or procedural

memory. Further, it must be acknowledged that cortical pathology exists in these 
patients (for example, de la Monte, Wells, Hedley-Whyte, & Growdon, 1989), which 
could account for these deficits. 
30-1.3. Future Directions 
In spite of evidence that cortical dysfunction plays a major role in language deficits 
after basal ganglia stroke, it is possible that this cortical dysfunction obscures a minor, 
supportive role for the basal ganglia in language. Alexander (1992) tested language 
in patients with infarcts in the dominant basal ganglia and surrounding white matter. 
In some instances, the lesions were small. Motor speech deficits were prominent. Even 
in cases where the lesions were small, Alexander noted some word-finding deficits, 
semantic substitutions, and impairment in complex comprehension. He concluded that 
this deficit pattern had little "instrumental specificity"; that is, it did not implicate 
any particular linguistic function. One explanation he offered for the language symp- 
toms was that a "facilitatory," "activating," or "enabling" system affecting multiple 
language functions was damaged. Raymer, Moberg, Crosson, Nadeau, and Rothi 
(1997) have suggested that giving sensitive tests of language function to patients with 
lacunar infarcts limited to the striatum would be a way of resolving this issue. Lacunar 
infarcts are unlikely to reflect occlusion of large cerebral vessels (Poirier, Gray, & 
Escourolle, 1990) and, therefore, may avoid the confounding effects of circulatory 
dynamics present in larger lesions. 
The work of Malapani, Pillon, Dubois, and Agid (1994) offers what might be a 
more promising approach to this question. They administered auditory and visual 
choice reaction-time tasks to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients either separately or 
concurrently in both the on and the off (dopamine-depleted) states. They found im- 
pairment in the concurrent but not the separate administration in the dopamine- 
depleted state. Since this state has a major impact on striatal function, it is likely that 
differences in cognitive function during the off state were related to basal ganglia 
function. Nonetheless, it must be conceded that mesocortical or mesolimbic dopamine 
pathways could impact cognition in the off state. Still, this approach also could be 
used with language functions, including syntactic comprehension. However, we are 
not optimistic that a significant indirect role for the basal ganglia in language will be 
defined. 
30-2. THE ROLE OF THE THALAMUS 
IN LANGUAGE 
30-2.1. Historical Perspective on Theory 
As with the basal ganglia, numerous studies from the 1970s on have demonstrated 
aphasia after dominant thalamic lesions. However, the picture is more coherent than 
for the basal ganglia. First, thalamic lesions are usually caused by small vessel disease, 

30 
Subcortical Structures in Language 
437 
and therefore, less likely to be accompanied by aberrant cortical circulation. Aphasia 
is almost invariably found after lesions in the dominant tuberothalamic (polar) artery 
territory. Not infrequently, aphasia also is found after a lesion in the dominant inter- 
peduncular profundus (paramedian) artery territory (Crosson, 1992). Aphasia after 
thalamic lesions is almost always characterized by normal or minimally impaired 
repetition. Word finding with semantic paraphasia is common and may deteriorate into 
jargon. Neologisms are sometimes apparent. Comprehension is generally less impaired 
than output. Aphasia lasts months or years in some patients (Crosson, 1984, 1992). 
These findings led some theorists to speculate about a role for the thalamus in lan- 
guage. 
A number of authors suggested that this role involves arousal mechanisms (Hor- 
enstein, Chung, & Brenner, 1978; McFarling, Rothi, & Heilman, 1982; Riklan & 
Cooper, 1975). Others have suggested that thalamic nuclei direct activation important 
for the modulation and integration of language (for example, Cooper et al., 1968; 
Samra et al., 1969). Ojemann (1983) carried this reasoning a step further, suggesting 
that "thalamic alerting processes selectively activate the specific discrete cortical areas 
(mosaics) appropriate to the particular language processing" (p. 203). Others have 
suggested an integrative role for the thalamus in language (for example, Penfield & 
Roberts, 1959; Schuell et al., 1965). Along these lines, Crosson (1985, 1992) had 
suggested that the thalamus was involved in semantic verification of formulated lan- 
guage segments prior to their release for motor programming. In the scheme of Wal- 
lesch and Papagno (1988), the role of the thalamus in language was primarily related 
to its position in cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops (see earlier discussion 
on the basal ganglia). 
30-2.2. Recent Developments 
30-2.2.1. Selective Engagement of Cortical Mechanisms as a Role 
for Thalamic Nuclei in Language 
Nadeau and Crosson (1997) examined lesions in four cases of thalamic aphasia in 
order to ascertain the precise nuclei involved. In two cases, the lesion was in the 
territory of the tuberothalamic artery, and, among other structures, the ventral anterior 
portion of the nucleus reticularis was damaged. The nucleus reticularis (NR) is a thin 
shell of neurons surrounding most of the thalamus that has inhibitory (GABAergic) 
output to most thalamic nuclei. The ventral anterior portion of this nucleus has dense 
synaptic connections with and is pierced by a large bundle of fibers that connects the 
frontal lobes with the thalamus, the inferior thalamic peduncle. In the other two cases, 
the lesion was more posterior, in the territory of the interpeduncular profundus artery. 
While these lesions did not impact the ventral anterior portion of the NR, they did 
damage the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CM). Two of these patients, one 
with a lesion affecting the ventral anterior NR and one with a lesion affecting the 
CM, received extensive language testing by our group (Raymer et al., 1997). Both 
had similar naming deficits that compromised both written and oral naming and 

438 
Bruce Crosson and Stephen E. Nadeau 
affected naming to definition as well as visual confrontation naming. Other lexical 
and semantic functions were intact. These patients consistently had greater difficulty 
with low- as opposed to high-frequency words, and errors were primarily semantically 
related to the target. Raymer et al. concluded that these patients had an impairment 
affecting the lexical-semantic interface. What would cause such an impairment at the 
lexical-semantic interface? 
Nadeau and Crosson (1997) reasoned that the similarity in these cases was due to 
the involvement of different portions of the same neural system. The hypothesized 
system (Figure 2) involved the frontal lobes, the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP), the 
nucleus reticularis (NR), and the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CM). Ac- 
cording to the authors, the system is involved in "selective enhancement of thalamic 
output relevant to intentionally guided attention and behavior." In addition to their 
analysis of lesion location in thalamic aphasia, Nadeau and Crosson's hypothesis was 
based on a large body of physiological evidence. These studies included evidence that 
thalamic neurons reside in one of two states: a burst-firing mode in which there is 
little correspondence between input and output, and a single-spike mode in which 
there is good correspondence between input and output (McCormick & Feeser, 1990; 
Steriade, Jones, & Llinas, 1990). Steriade, Domich, and Oakson (1986) suggested that 
input from the nucleus reticularis serves to put thalamic neurons into the single-spike 
firing mode whereby information can be transferred between afferent sources of the 
thalamus and targets of thalamic projections. In addition, the work of Yingling and 
Skinner (1977) indicated that the frontal-ITP-NR-CM system could enhance or sup- 
press sensory signals traveling via the thalamus to the cortex. Nadeau and Crosson 
(1997) reasoned that the action of the frontal-ITP-NR-CM system could affect not 
only the transmission of sensory information (that is, attention) but also could serve 
to selectively engage cortical systems necessary to perform various cognitive func- 
tions. 
One way to conceptualize the impact of selective engagement on lexical selection 
processes is in terms of levels of activation for individual lexical items (similar to the 
concept used in parallel distributed processing [PDP] models [Rumelhart, McClelland, 
and the PDP research group, 1986]). Selective engagement helps to amplify the dif- 
ference in activation level between the target item and competing items. Without 
selective engagement, the difference in activation levels between the target lexical 
item and semantically related, competing items is reduced, and the probability of 
misselection of a semantically related item increases dramatically. This explanation 
would explain the pattern of errors in the cases of Raymer et al. (1997). 
Some aspects of this selective engagement theory remain to be worked out. For 
example, the precise role of the CM in selective engagement is not clear. The CM 
and related intralaminar thalamic nuclei have diffuse projections to most areas of the 
cerebral cortex (Jones, 1985). It is possible that these connections are the means by 
which different cortical mechanisms are engaged, but the connections may be too 
sparse to support such a function. The NR has a consistent relationship with most 
thalamic nuclei; portions of the NR are related to specific thalamic nuclei, sending 
inhibitory projections to their targets (Jones, 1985). Selective engagement may occur

This schematic diagram represents the anatomical system that has been proposed by Nadeau 
and Crosson (1997) to regulate selective engagement of cortical mechanisms. CM = centromedian nucleus 
of thalamus; IML = internal medullary lamina; ITP = inferior thalamic peduncle; MRF = midbrain 
reticular formation; NR = nucleus reticularis of thalamus; NRvA = ventral anterior portion of the nucleus 
reticularis; VA = ventral anterior nucleus of thalamus. For the sake of clarity in the figure, diffuse pro- 
jections from the cerebral cortex to the thalamus, projections from thalamic nuclei to the cortex, and 
collateral projections from cortex and thalamus to NR have not been diagrammed. (From S. E. Nadeau &

Press.) 
through the influence of the frontal lobes via the ITP on the NR, which acts to gate 
output from most thalamic nuclei. Since the CM and other intralaminar nuclei have 
almost no projections to other thalamic nuclei, it is unlikely that they influence other 
thalamic nuclei and this gating directly. However, connections from the CM to the 
frontal lobes may provide a means by which the CM impacts frontal functions, which 
in turn influence the NR's gating of various other thalamic nuclei. Because of its 

440 
Bruce Crosson and Stephen E. Nadeau 
connections with perisylvian language cortex, the pulvinar is a prime candidate for a 
nucleus whose output could be gated to selectively engage language mechanisms. This 
is an area where good research in animal models could impact our knowledge about 
subcortical systems that impact cognition. Studies that follow up on the CM compo- 
nent of Skinner and Yingling's (1977) model would be welcome in this regard. The 
reader wishing further details is referred to Nadeau and Crosson (1997). 
In addition to the selective engagement theory, two other recent developments raise 
interesting questions regarding the role of the thalamus in linguistic processing. Cases 
of category-specific naming deficits (that is, semantically bounded anomia) after tha- 
lamic lesion suggest that thalamic nuclei are involved in processing information in 
semantic or related realms that in turn impacts naming of specific categories of items. 
Neglect dyslexia accompanying visual neglect in a case of thalamic lesion indicates 
that thalamic mechanisms impact reading early in visual processing. We will address 
the topic of category-specific naming deficits first. 
30-2.2.2. Category-Specific Naming Deficits after Thalamic Lesion 
Cortical lesions have been reported to cause category-specific naming deficits for such 
items as body parts (Dennis, 1976), fruits and vegetables (Farah & Wallace, 1992; 
Hart, Berndt, & Caramazza, 1985), letters (Goodglass, Wingfield, Hyde, & Theurkauf, 
1986), country names (McKenna & Warrington, 1978), indoor objects (Yamadori & 
Albert, 1973), animals (Hart & Gordon, 1992; Hillis & Caramazza, 1991; Stewart, 
Parkin, & Hunkin, 1992; Temple, 1986), medical items (Weinstein & Kahn, 1955), 
proper names (Semenza, & Zettin, 1988), and artifactual objects (Sacchett & Hum- 
phreys, 1992). Explanations for these deficits have ranged from dysfunction in the 
semantic system (for example, Sacchett & Humphreys, 1992) to effects of frequency, 
familiarity, and/or complexity (for example, Stewart et al., 1992; Funnell & Sheridan, 
1992) to inability to map semantic information onto items in the output lexicon (Farah 
& Wallace, 1992). Thus far, the literature has not suggested any one mechanism that 
can account for all cases. Category-specific naming deficits have offered a challenge 
to our models about how information is represented in the brain because some authors 
have suggested that specific lexical, semantic, or lexical-semantic knowledge about 
the involved items is stored in specific regions of cortex (see Farah & Wallace, 1992). 
This issue has been hotly debated. It is also possible that category-specific naming 
deficits represent an anomalous organization that is present in a significant minority 
of cases. 
Lucchelli and De Renzi (1992) described a case of anomia for proper names (pri- 
marily the names of people) in a case of infarction in the territory of the dominant 
tuberothalamic artery, affecting the ventral anterior nucleus, the ventral lateral nucleus, 
the mammillothalamic tract, and the internal capsule. The deficit was present whether 
naming from photographs or from description. Semantic knowledge was intact because 
the patient nearly always could give details about the persons he was unable to name, 
and phonemic cuing was less effective than giving the first name to evoke the surname. 
Further, the patient was unable to learn associations between new names and faces, 

30 
Subcortical Structures in Language 
441 
though he could learn to associate occupations with faces. Three years later, Moreaud, 
Pellat, Charnallet, Carbonnel, and Brennen (1995) also reported a case of anomia for 
proper names that included both names of persons and geographic locations. Again, 
the infarction was in the territory of the tuberothalamic artery. The deficit was present 
whether naming from picture or description. We have also reported a patient with a 
category-specific deficit for naming medical items from definition (Crosson, Moberg, 
Boone, Rothi, & Ramer, in press), which was established by comparing his perform- 
ance on experimental lists to that of normal controls and that of anomic patients. 
However, he had a hemorrhagic lesion in the posterior thalamus (including portions 
of the pulvinar and the centromedian nuclei) and the internal capsule. Like other 
patients with category-specific naming disorders, the items he missed were consistent 
across different test sessions. Similar to the case of Lucchelli and De Renzi (1992), 
phonemic cuing did not assist with retrieval. Familiarity, imageability, and abstractness 
did not account for his deficit. 
Because it is highly unlikely that the thalamus is the site of storage for represen- 
tations relevant for converting semantic information to a specific lexical item, the idea 
that the relevant stored representations (see Farah & Wallace, 1992) are destroyed in 
category-specific naming deficits can be ruled out, at least for these cases. An alter- 
native explanation is that thalamic nuclei are engaged in neural nets that translate 
semantic information into a specific lexical output. Lucchelli and de Renzi (1992) 
suggested how this might happen in one case. In addition to his anomia for proper 
names, their patient had trouble learning both arbitrary associations between colors 
and numbers and associations between names and faces. Yet he was able to learn 
associations between faces and occupations much better. They emphasized a difficulty 
associating labels (that is, names) that carry little descriptive value for the object they 
represent. This difficulty in associating arbitrary labels or associations occurred for 
well-learned information (that is, proper narmes) as well as for new information. The 
findings of Lucchelli and De Renzi (1992) indicate that a principle more fundamental 
than semantic category may underlie many, if not most, category-specific naming 
deficits. Unfortunately, such principles may remain opaque to investigational methods 
in many instances, including our own case (Crosson et al., 1997). 
The anatomical implications for these category-specific naming deficits are not 
clear. The anterior thalamus was involved in the two cases of proper name anomia 
(Lucchelli & De Renzi, 1992; Moreaud et al., 1995), but the posterior thalamus was 
involved in difficulty naming medical items (Crosson et al., 1997). Similar systems 
may be involved in all cases and include anterior and posterior thalamic structures 
(see earlier discussion on selective engagement). On the other hand, different thalamic 
nuclei may be involved in specific processes that will affect different substrates for 
naming. 
30-2.2.3. Neglect Dyslexia after Thalamic Lesion 
Some cases of neglect dyslexia have implicated deficits early in visual processing. In 
neglect dyslexia (Ellis, Flude, & Young, 1987; Hillis & Caramazza, 1990), some 

442 
Bruce Crosson and Stephen E. Nadeau 
patients perform much better when words are spelled orally for them than when they 
are actually reading, and some cases do not show this pattern. For their case of neglect 
dyslexia who performed well with oral spelling, Ellis et al. (1987) suggested that the 
deficit was not in the patient's visual image of the word (that is, visual input lexicon) 
because it could be accessed through oral spelling. Rather, the deficit was earlier in 
visual processing and affected the ability to encode letter identity but not position. In 
such cases, top-down influences from the visual input lexicon would influence how 
the neglected portion of the word was completed, resulting in frequent errors. 
We reanalyzed the reading errors of a previously reported case of thalamic aphasia 
(Crosson et al. 1986) and discovered that they could be attributed to neglect dyslexia 
(Ellis, Flude, & Young, 1987; Hillis & Caramazza, 1990). This patient had a hem- 
orrhagic infarction of the lateral nucleus of the thalamus that extended into the pul- 
vinar. Although his language output was characterized by semantic paraphasias, similar 
to other cases of thalamic aphasia, his oral reading was characterized by the substi- 
tution of words similar in phonology to the target response. He exhibited evidence of 
right-sided spatial neglect. Upon further examination, it was discovered that the words 
he substituted in reading frequently had the same letters on the left-hand side as the 
target word, but different letters on the right-hand side of the word; that is, he showed 
neglect dyslexia. (This phenomenon has been seen somewhat more frequently with 
right-hemisphere lesion where the right side of the word is the same and the left side 
of the substituted word is different from the target word.) Similar to the patient of 
Ellis et al. (1987), our patient's performance improved with oral spelling. Following 
Ellis et al. (1987), it is suggested that impairment was in early visual processing of 
words, not in the visual image contained in the visual input lexicon. This finding 
underscores the need for careful evaluation of reading functions in cases of thalamic 
lesion. 
30-2.3. Future Directions 
There are reasons to believe that the thalamus plays an important role in language, 
though it may be one of supporting linguistic functions as opposed to one of primary 
linguistic processing. First, unlike striatocapsular infarctions, a syndrome of language 
impairment emerges from reports of thalamic aphasia (Crosson, 1992): Repetition is 
almost always unimpaired or minimally impaired. Semantic paraphasia usually pre- 
dominates over phonemic paraphasia and neologism; paraphasia may be so severe as 
to deteriorate into jargon. Although patients may have difficulty initiating language in 
the initial stages after the cerebrovascular accident, language usually evolves into a 
relatively fluent output with intact grammar. Second, isolated thalamic infarctions are 
due to small vessel disease, which does not implicate cortical function in the same 
way that major basal ganglia infarcts do. Third, there is some consistency in symp- 
tomatology and lesion location, with infarcts in the dominant tuberothalamic territory 
almost always producing language deficits (Crosson, 1992). For these reasons, the role 
of the thalamus in language processes is not in question in the way that the role of 

30 
Subcortical Structures in Language 
443 
the basal ganglia is. The relevant question regarding the thalamus is, How does it play 
a direct or supportive role in language? 
In this regard, we have proposed a selective engagement mechanism that increases 
the efficiency of structures needed to process language in such a way that appropriate 
lexical choices are more reliably differentiated from semantically related but inaccurate 
alternatives. Several questions need to be answered about this selective engagement 
theory. We have noted that animal studies could be useful in determining the role of 
the CM, that is, whether it directly affects cortical processing or whether it indirectly 
affects the NR's gating of other thalamic nuclei thereby affecting cortical processing. 
Although selective engagement accounts for the type of anomia seen in the cases 
of Raymer et al. (1997), it is not clear how well it could account for cases of category- 
specific naming deficit. The responses of Raymer et al.'s cases of general naming 
deficit differed in some important ways from Crosson et al.'s (1997) case of category- 
specific naming deficit. Most notably, in the category-specific naming deficit, no fre- 
quency effect was seen and errors were generally nonresponses as opposed to semantic 
errors. These differences may be related to the underlying cognitive process that is 
interrupted. More careful analysis of category-specific deficits in thalamic lesion 
would be helpful in resolving such issues. Similarly, the role of thalamic gating and 
neglect dyslexia in reading deficits after thalamic lesions deserves further attention. 
Another potential area for investigation involves the distinction between knowledge 
of procedures that can be applied without conscious attention and knowledge of facts 
and relationships that is consciously declared. We have suggested elsewhere (Crosson, 
1992; Nadeau & Crosson, 1997) that grammar may fall into the category of pro- 
cedural knowledge while lexical and semantic knowledge falls under the declarative 
rubric. In this regard, it is of interest that Raymer et al.'s (1997) cases of thalamic 
anomia showed no impairment of syntax, suggesting that the damaged thalamic mech- 
anisms affected processes within the declarative realm. Further exploration regarding 
the dissociation of grammatical and lexical-semantic functions after thalamic lesion 
would be useful. For example, is knowledge of other well-learned procedures unaf- 
fected by thalamic lesion, and how does this compare to cases of basal ganglia dys- 
function like PD where new procedural learning may be affected (see Crosson, 1992 
for review)? 
Although it is likely that analysis of patients with thalamic lesions will continue 
to be an important source of information concerning thalamic functions in language, 
several problems with this lesion methodology exist. One problem is the relative rarity 
of thalamic lesion cases. The lack of sizable groups of patients with thalamic lesions 
means that studies are almost always case studies, and a large group study is virtually 
impossible. This problem leaves us vulnerable to case reports where symptoms may 
reflect premorbid anomalous brain organization as well as the results of the lesion. 
A second problem is that lesions most often do not encompass only the structure 
of interest. For example, it would be difficult on the basis of lesion data to distinguish 
between the contribution of the ventral anterior nucleus from that of the ventral 
anterior nucleus reticularis because both structures are likely to be damaged in 

444 
Bruce Crosson and Stephen E. Nadeau 
tuberothalamic artery infarctions. A third problem is that it is difficult to distinguish 
the contribution of the lesioned structure from the optimal compensatory operation of 
cognitive system of interest without the structure. For example, do semantic errors in 
thalamic aphasia reflect disruption of the semantic system or compensation by the 
semantic system for some other type of retrieval problem? 
Thus, it would be optimal to have other methods to investigate the role of the 
thalamus in language. One potential alternative is functional neuroimaging. The po- 
tential resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is high enough to 
allow us to distinguish between regions of the thalamus. For example, in an fMRI 
study of working memory conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Crosson 
et al., 1996), we found an area of increased activity in the anterior thalamus, a separate 
area of increased activity in the posterior thalamus, and an area of increased activity 
in the body of the caudate nucleus during a semantic working memory task. This task 
required subjects to detect membership of stimulus words in remembered categories. 
Increased activity of the anterior thalamus was also detected on a phonological work- 
ing memory task that required subjects to detect if stimulus words rhymed with re- 
membered words. In an orthographic working memory task, in which subjects at- 
tended to parts of words rather than whole words, no thalamic activity was seen. 
Nadeau and Crosson (1997) have suggested that the construct of selective engagement 
could be applied to lexical-semantic working memory: the transient selective en- 
gagement of one or more neural nets in a particular way instantiates the working 
memory of a particular semantic construct or lexical representation. The activity in- 
creases seen in the anterior thalamus by Crosson et al. (1996) during working memory 
tasks are at the extreme margin of the anterior thalamus and may include the portions 
of the nucleus reticularis implicated by Nadeau and Crosson (1997) in selective 
engagement. Positron emission tomography has also been used to study thalamic ac- 
tivity in cognitive tasks such as those requiring attention (for example, LaBerge & 
Buchsbaum, 1990). Thus, functional neuroimaging of normal subjects can overcome 
some of the problems involved in studying thalamic lesion cases, including rarity of 
thalamic lesion cases and inability to study normal operation of a cognitive system 
after damage to one of its components. Although there are many caveats about the 
use of functional neuroimaging in cognitive studies (Nadeau & Crosson, 1995), the 
techniques have the potential to contribute to our knowledge concerning the role of 
the thalamus in language. 
30-3. CONCLUSIONS 
Ultimately, the goal of neurolinguistics is to understand how the brain operates as a 
system to process and generate linguistic communications. One area of research in 
this field endeavors to determine the components of neural systems involved in lan- 
guage and the roles they play in language processing. It is generally true of all forms 
of cognition and behavior, including language, that we must understand the role of 
subcortical structures if we hope to have a complete understanding of how brain 

30 
Subcortical Structures in Language 
445 
systems process cognitive information. In some instances, the answer at which we 
arrive may be that a particular subcortical structure is not involved in language. Based 
on our review, we believe this may be the case for the basal ganglia. Future research 
should focus on this question. In other cases, subcortical structures may play important 
supporting roles in cognitive processes, and in some instances perhaps even crucial 
roles. Our research and assessment of the literature indicate that the thalamus plays a 
significant role in language. We have suggested that this role includes involvement in 
selective engagement of cortical mechanisms necessary to carry out a cognitive task; 
however, further research will be needed to precisely define the role or roles of the 
thalamus in language.

Disturbances in language and communication are prominent symptoms in de- 
mentia. Many dementing illnesses lead to aphasia, others primarily impair verbal 
fluency or result in motor speech disturbances such as dysarthria. This chap- 
ter discusses language and communication disturbances that occur in non- 
Alzheimer's dementias, including related abnormalities in cognition, aspects of 
neuropathology, and neuroimaging. The language deficits in vascular dementia 
(VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (e.g., Pick's disease), Huntington's disease 
(HD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 
and primary progessive aphasia (PPA) are included. Implications for future re- 
search are also noted. 
This chapter reviews language and communication disorders due to cerebrobvascular 
disease (vascular dementia), degeneration of the frontal lobes and the anterior temporal 
lobes (frontotemporal dementias), and other neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 
Most patients with the unique entity of primary progressive aphasia eventually pro- 
gress to dementia, and this disorder is also discussed. Because these are dementing 
disorders, language deficits occur within the context of other cognitive deficits, and 
this relationship will be reviewed.

31-1. VASCULAR 
DEMENTIA 
31-1.1. Clinical Characteristics and Etiology 
Studies suggest that vascular disease accounts for between 9% and 35% of dementia 
patients among elderly subjects (Kase, Wolf, Backman, Linn, & Cupples, 1989). Vas- 
cular dementia (VaD) is more common among men than among women, and increases 
in prevalence with increasing age. Autopsy studies indicate that 25-33% of persons 
who die with dementia have vascular disease as a major or sole contributing cause 
(Chui et al., 1992). 
The concept of vascular dementia has undergone many changes in the last few 
years. Previous studies of VaD have used the diagnostic and statistical manual of 
mental disorders, 3rd edition revised (DSM-III-R, American Psychiatric Association, 
1987) or a rating on the Hachinski Ischemia Scale to classify patients (Hachinski, 
Lassen, & Marshall, 1974). Recent improvements in our understanding of the disease 
process have led to new guidelines for diagnosis (Roman et al., 1993). According to 
the new National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association In- 
ternationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) 
diagnostic criteria for VaD, three things must be included: presence of dementia, ev- 
idence of cerebrovascular disease, and a temporal relationship between these two 
disorders. The subtypes or cerebrovascular lesions associated with VaD include major 
vessel multi-infarct dementia, strategic single infarct dementia, small vessel ischemic 
disease with dementia, multiple lacunar strokes, hypoperfusion, hemorrhagic changes, 
and others. VaD often progresses in a stepwise fashion and depression, anxiety, and 
apathy are common (Cummings, 1988; Sultzer, Levin, Mahler, High, & Cummings, 
1993). Sometimes focal neurologic changes are present such as paresis, gait abnor- 
malities, incontinence, and bradykinesia. Gait problems and bradykinesia may be 
prominent even when the dementia is not severe (Thal, Grundman, & Klauber, 1988). 
Although the new classification system (Roman et al., 1993) is likely to improve future 
research findings by ensuring a more precise subject selection, most studies to date 
reflect old classification approaches (Loeb & Gandolfo, 1988) and may include pa- 
tients with various disease states including VaD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mixed 
dementia. 
31-1.2. Cognitive Changes 
The most common cognitive impairments in VaD are bradyphrenia, decreased initia- 
tion and spontaneity, and executive function deficits such as difficulties with set shift- 
ing and verbal fluency (Wolfe, Linn, Babikian, Knoefel, & Albert, 1990). These 
changes occur irrespective of the type of VaD and may relate to the common subfrontal 
and periventricular ischemic lesions. Moreover, executive function abilities discrimi- 
nate between VaD and AD (Almkvist, 1994; Kertesz & Clydesdale, 1994; Mendez & 
Mendez, 1991). Otherwise, the most common neuropsychological pattern is one of 
heterogeneity of performance depending on the location of the strokes (LaRue, 1992). 

31 
Non-Alzheimer's Dementias

VaD with strokes in the left hemisphere temporal and parietal cortex often results in 
aphasia, alexia with agraphia, acalculia, or apraxia. VaD with occipital lobe strokes 
often results in visual field deficits or hemianopsias. Vascular damage to the hippo- 
campi and adjacent structures frequently results in a profound anterograde amnesia. 
31-1.3. Overall Speech and Language Changes 
Language and speech findings reported in VaD, although sometimes contradictory, 
reflect both the focal neurological motor signs and the heterogeneity of lesion loca- 
tions. Nevertheless, most studies have shown shared features such as reduced verbal 
fluency in VaD in both free speech and formal verbal fluency tasks (Hier, Hagenlocker, 
& Shindler, 1985; Mendez & Mendez, 1991; Powell, Cummings, Hill, & Benson, 
1988). The decreased verbal fluency in VaD patients is likely due to bilateral subcor- 
tical lesions in the frontal regions (Ishii, Nishihara, & Imamura, 1986). 
Other common language findings can be attributed to more focal neurological le- 
sions. For example, Cummings and Benson (1992) noted that one of the most common 
occlusions occurs in the middle cerebral artery stem or branches and aphasias com- 
monly follow when the left hemisphere is lesioned (Benson & Geschwind, 1975; 
Geschwind, 1975). Infarctions anterior to the rolandic fissure often produce nonfluent 
aphasias, and infarctions in the posterior temporal or parietal regions usually produce 
fluent aphasias. Specific lesions in the left angular gyrus region may produce alexia 
and the Gerstmann syndrome (acalculia, right-left disorientation, agraphia, and finger 
agnosia) (Cummings & Benson, 1992). In general, these patients often complain of 
word-finding problems and may have a semantic anomia with inability to recognize 
the meaning of words. Refer to Table 1 for a summary of reported deficit findings in 
VaD. 
31-1.3.1. Verbal Communication 
Powell et al. (1988) examined speech and language functions in VaD compared to 
AD patients with comparable dementia severity. They found that VaD patients exhib- 
ited more abnormalities of motor aspects of speech than the AD patients, including 
poor articulation and rate; VaD patients had shorter and less grammatically complex 
phrases but communicated more information. Other investigators have reported similar 
findings of reduced verbal output, shorter phrase lengths, and simplified syntax (e.g., 
fewer subordinate clauses, fewer words, and fewer unique words) (Hier et al., 1985). 
In addition, VaD patients may have perseverations and intrusions in their speech (Shin- 
dler, Caplan, & Hier, 1984). 
31-1.3.2. Comprehension 
In several studies, impaired comprehension was present in nearly all of the patients 
with VaD (Almkvist, 1994; Kertesz & Clydesdale, 1994; Kertesz, Polk, & Carr, 1990; 
Powell et al., 1988). Villardita (1993) found deficits on the Token Test and the re- 

450 
Monique M. Cherrier et al. 
porter's test. Relative to AD patients, VaD patients perform better on Luria and West- 
ern Aphasia Battery tasks concerned with understanding complex grammatical 
structures (Kontiola, Laaksonen, Sulkava, & Erkinjuntti, 1990; Powell et al., 1988). 
31-1.3.3. Confrontation Naming and Repetition 
Confrontation naming deficits are often present (Kertesz & Clydesdale, 1994; Kontiola 
et al., 1990), although they are usually not as severe as those in AD (Bayles & 
Tomoeda, 1983; Powell et al., 1988; Villardita, 1993). The reports are conflicting with 
regard to greater repetition difficulty in VaD than AD (Kertesz & Clydesdale, 1994; 
Kontiola et al., 1990). 
31-1.3.4. Reading and Writing 
Subtle word recognition deficits may occur in VaD patients (Kontiola et al., 1990), 
and prominent alexia can occur with lesions in the left angular gyrus. Kertesz and 
Clydesdale (1994) found that VaD patients had more dysgraphia than AD patients. 
The VaD group had greater difficulty writing letters presented individually in dictation, 
had significantly poorer copying of words in sentences, and obtained little benefit 
from the opportunity to copy previously dictated material. These language and speech 
findings likely reflect focal neurological motor signs found in VaD patients along with 
heterogeneity of these signs resulting in contradictory results between studies. 
31-1.4. Gaps in the Literature 
All of the studies reviewed and summarized in Table 1 specifically examined language 
functions in VaD patients in comparison to AD patients. While this comparison can

be useful, what is lacking is an examination of language impairments in VaD in a 
longitudinal manner. Verbal fluency and confrontation naming may be less useful in 
discriminating patients with VaD and AD than an analysis of narrative discourse 
(LaRue, 1992). As noted earlier, studies to date reflect patient groups of various eti- 
ologies due to the use of different diagnostic classification criteria. In fact, investi- 
gators have often excluded patients with large lesions or lesions in Wernicke's or 
Broca's areas (Hier et al., 1985; Kertesz & Clydesdale, 1994). This type of exclusion, 
while useful for some types of research questions, obscures important information 
concerning the manifestations of various VaD subtypes. The examination of language 
in VaD can profit greatly from the increasing availability of sophisticated imaging 
technology along with the recent development of diagnostic guidelines. 
31-2. FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIAS 
31-2.1. Clinical Characteristics and Etiology 
The frontotemporal dementias (FTD) make up about 10% of all dementias. The FTDs 
are composed of frontal lobe degeneration without Pick bodies and with or without 
motor neuron dysfunction. Although much of the literature is devoted to Pick's dis- 
ease, it has been shown that Pick's disease is usually not clinically distinguishable 
from the less specific frontal lobe degeneration. Pick's disease makes up about 2-3% 
of all dementias and 20-25% of FTDs (Gustafson, 1993; Mendez, Selwood, Mastri, 
& Frey, 1993). 
FTD is a progressive dementia, characterized by early personality changes and 
frontal or frontotemporal atrophy on neuroimaging (Brun, 1993; Knopman et al., 1989; 
Lund & Manchester, 1994; Mendez et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1991). Neuropathological 
changes include prominent lobar atrophy of gray and white matter. Pick's disease is 
distinguished by the additional presence of argentophilic intranuclear inclusions 
known as Pick's bodies (Baldwin & Forstl, 1993). Males and females are equally 
affected. Symptoms include prominent apathy, decreased initiative, disinhibition, and 
impulsivity. Poor personal hygiene, socially inappropriate behaviors, and sexual dis- 
inhibition are common. Emotional lability frequently occurs with depression, mania, 
anger, and irritability (Mendez et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1991). If bilateral temporal 
lobe degeneration and amygdala damage are also present, FTD patients are predis- 
posed to the Kltiver-Bucy syndrome (Cummings & Duchen, 1981; Lilly, Cummings, 
Benson, & Frankl, 1983; Mendez et al., 1993). This syndrome includes hypermeta- 
morphosis, hyperorality, hypersexuality, visual agnosia, and blunted emotional reac- 
tivity. 
31-2.2. Cognitive Changes 
The neuropsychological findings of FTD include prominent executive function dis- 
turbances, even early in the disease. There are deficits on planning and follow-through, 

452 
Monique M. Cherrier et al. 
set shifting, sequencing, and judgment. Memory is less impaired than executive func- 
tions although there are eventual retrieval deficits for verbal information and episodic 
information. Occipitoparietal functions are relatively preserved, and visuospatial func- 
tions remain intact for most patients (Hodges & Gurd, 1994; Johanson & Hagberg, 
1989). 
31-2.3. Overall Speech and Language Changes 
Speech changes include a progressive reduction of speech (economy of utterances), 
stereotypy of speech (repetition of same words, phrases, themes), echolalia, and per- 
severation (Knopman et al., 1989; Mendez, Selwood, Mastri, & Frey, 1993; Wechsler, 
Verity, Rosenschein, Fried, Schrebel, 1982). At later stages of the disease, mutism is 
common (Cummings & Benson, 1992; Mendez et al., 1993). A comparison of Pick's 
and AD patients also found mutism along with preserved receptive language to be 
more common in Pick's disease (Gustafson, Brun, & Risberg, 1990). Holland, Mc- 
Burney, Moossy, and Reinmuth (1985) reported a well-studied patient with autopsy- 
confirmed Pick's disease. The patient first evidenced slight errors in his speech, along 
with slowed pace and long pauses. He began to substitute lower-frequency words for 
higher-frequency words and evidenced word-finding difficulties despite intact con- 
frontation naming and intact reading and writing skills. The patient commonly used 
generic terms such as "thing" and relied on particular words to convey several mean- 
ings. Writing samples also demonstrated word-finding difficulties, semantic errors, 
reduction of outputs, and perseverations. The patient continued to deteriorate to the 
point of complete mutism but still retained the ability to read and write despite im- 
paired auditory comprehension. A summary of reported impairments in frontotemporal 
dementias is provided in Table 2. 
Cummings and Duchen (1981) examined five cases of autopsy-confirmed Pick's 
disease for the presence of Kltiver-Bucy syndrome. They found language disturbances

in all five cases. Three of the five had early word-finding difficulties in spontaneous 
speech and failed tests of confrontation naming. All five eventually had reduced vo- 
cabulary, excessive use of verbal stereotypes, echolalia, or complete loss of intelligible 
speech. 
31-3. HUNTINGTON'S 
DISEASE 
31-3.1. Clinical Characteristics and Etiology 
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder distinguished by choreath- 
eosis, caudate atrophy, and an autosomal dominant inheritance (Mendez, 1994). The 
gene responsible is on the terminal short arm of chromosome 4 and has nearly 100% 
penetrance, with no phenotypic differences between heterozygotes and homozygotes 
(Martin, 1984). Recently, thegenetic defect has proven to be an abnormal, excessive 
repetition of the triplet nucleotide of cytosine and guanine. Equally common in men 
and women, HD affects 3 to 10 per 100,000 people with a mean age of onset around 
41 years (Martin, 1984). 
The diagnosis of HD is largely dependent on the recognition of choreoathetosis, a 
movement disorder characterized by jerky movements and slower writhing motions 
often leading to dystonic posturing. Clinicians may mistake these movements for nerv- 
ousness, mannerisms, or intentional acts (Mendez, 1994). Eventually, choreoathetosis 
decreases as dystonia and akinesia-rigidity supervenes. Other diagnostic features in- 
clude ocular motor changes and psychiatric symptoms such as depression, mania, 
personality disorders, suicides, and hyper- or hyposexuality in the later stages of the 
disease (Mendez, 1994). Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) demonstrate caudate atrophy in moderate or advanced HD. 
31-3.2. Cognitive Changes 
All HD patients eventually develop cognitive deficits. Changes in cognition are not 
strongly correlated with choreoathetosis; however, once choreoathetosis is present, HD 
patients have notable difficulties on timed tasks (e.g., performance measures on the 
WAIS) (Baxter et al., 1992; Josiassen, Curry, & Mancall, 1983). Although they usually 
have better explicit memory than AD patients, HD patients evidence procedural learn- 
ing deficits. In addition, they usually develop executive functioning problems, includ- 
ing managing and maintaining a cognitive set, abstraction, judgment, reasoning, se- 
quencing, and planning, along with mental flexibility (Mendez, 1994). 
31-3.3. Overall Speech and Language Changes 
Compared to other cognitive functions, language in HD is relatively preserved. HD 
patients do not develop aphasic syndromes and are better at object naming than AD 
patients (Brandt, Folstein, & Folstein, 1988; Fisher, Kennedy, Caine, & Shoulson, 
1983). The language changes that occur are more common in the later stages of the 

454 
Monique M. Cherrier et al. 
disease and include dysarthria, decreased verbal fluency and initiation, decreased ver- 
bal output, and terminal mutism. Table 3 outlines reported deficit findings for HD 
patients. 
31-3.3.1. Verbal Communication 
Early in HD, there is a decrease in spontaneous speech with single-word or short- 
phrase responses, and frequent silent intervals or pauses. The loss of conversational 
initiative substantially contributes to the patient's communicative disability. For ex- 
ample, on a 4-minute speech sample, HD patients demonstrated a 25% decrease in 
the number of words compared to normal controls (Gordon & Illes, 1987). The de- 
creased verbal output may gradually progress to mutism. 
The impact of dysarthria has a great effect on articulation and prosody in HD. 
Podoll, Caspary, Lange, and Noth (1988) found that motor speech was impaired in 
13% of early HD patients, 50% of middle-stage patients, and 87% of later-stage pa- 
tients. Spontaneous speech difficulties are most notable for the middle- and late-stage 
patients and include articulation and prosody errors (Podoll et al., 1988). Semantic 
and phonemic structure of free speech is usually well preserved into the late stages, 
however, the dysarthria may become so severe as to render the patient unintelligible 
(Gordon & Illes, 1987; Podoll et al., 1988). An in-depth examination of HD patients 
using the Montreal-Stanford Neurolinguistic Protocol investigated both the temporal 
and the lexical forms of spontaneous speech (Illes, 1989). Early stage HD patients 
evidenced short, rapid language segments, which declined with increasing disease 
severity. The HD patients also manifested a reduction in syntactic complexity, which 
was the most distinctive difference in comparison to healthy controls. Controversy 
remains over the existence of primary language disturbances in HD independent of 
motor speech changes. In an extensive review of language changes in HD, Podoll et 
al. (1988) failed to find primary language changes in HD. They found that the only 
language changes were neurological or neuropsychologically based. Rosser and 
Hodges (1994) examined verbal fluency tasks (letter and category) in AD, HD, and 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. They suggest that the poor letter fluency 
of HD and PSP, as opposed to category fluency, results from initiation and retrieval 
problems secondary to disruption of frontostriatal circuits. Thus, on a task of verbal 
fluency, it appears that frontostriatal degeneration found in HD may particularly affect 
verbal search abilities. 
HD patients produce significantly more self-corrections (whole-word repetitions), 
aborted phrases, and vocal interruptions, in comparison to a Parkinson's group. Illes 
(1989) suggested that these particular errors were representative of a self-corrective, 
compensatory strategy. As disease severity worsened, an increase in aborted phrases 
was found indicating failure of the self-corrective strategy. In general, persevera- 
tions and verbal stereotypes are uncommon and may occur only in HD patients with 
severe dementia. Podoll et al. (1988) found the semantic structure of spontaneous 
speech was intact with no evidence of semantic paraphasias or semantic jargon. Al- 
though some of the demented HD patients evidenced poverty of ideas, coherence of 

31 
Non-Alzheimer's Dementias 
455 
expression was preserved. They also found that syntactic structure was intact for all 
of the early stage patients, 71% of the middle-stage patient and 43% of the late 
stage patients. 
31-3.3.2. Comprehension 
Impaired comprehension in HD correlates highly with overall cognitive impairment. 
As with other language functions, comprehension is relatively intact in the early stages 
and is progressively impaired as the disease advances and cognitive impairments be- 
come pronounced. Podoll et al. (1988) found that 50% of the middle-stage patients 
and 74% of the late-stage patients scored below the normal range on a measure of 
verbal comprehension. Performance correlated highly with an overall cognitive im- 
pairment measure. Speedie, Brake, Folstein, Bowers, and Heilman (1990) found that 
HD patients were impaired in the ability to understand prosody. Two types of prosody 
were assessedmaffective prosody, when the patient was asked whether the tone of a 
recorded voice was happy, angry, or sad, and propositional prosody, which determines 
whether an utterence was a question or not. HD patients were impaired for both types 
of prosody, which may further hamper communication ability. 
31-3.3.3. Confrontation Naming and Repetition 
Confrontation naming may show little or no decline (Bayles & Tomoeda, 1983; But- 
ters, Sax, Montgomery, & Tarlow, 1978). Generally, early stage HD patients dem- 
onstrate intact ability whereas middle- and late-stage HD patients have naming errors 
(Podoll et al., 1988). Bayles and Tomoeda (1983) suggested that HD patients are 
impaired due to a central semantic deficit that occurs at the word-search stage of 
naming because many confrontation naming errors were semantically related to the 
item. However, Hodges, Salmon, and Butters (1991) examined a large group of AD, 
HD, and control patients and found that the naming deficits of HD patients could be 
attributed to visual or other perceptual deficits, whereas AD deficits were attributed 
to a breakdown in the organization of semantic knowledge. Repetition may be im- 
paired due to the dysarthric motor speech disorder. Repetition of consonants is more 
likely to be impaired than is the pronunciation of vowels (Podoll et al., 1988). Errors 
in repetition generally include the omission of words or the substitution of words or 
parts of words. 
31-3.3.4. Reading and Writing 
Podoll et al. (1988) found that 14% of middle-stage and 65% of severe-stage HD 
patients were compromised in their ability to read aloud due to dysarthria. Errors 
observed included hesitations, self-corrections, omissions, substitutions, and additions 
of letters and words. However, as with naming errors, reading difficulties may be due 
to a disturbance in visual registration or visual dyslexia (Marshall & Newcombe, 
1973). HD writing is slow, effortful, and characterized by sudden stops and strokes,

omissions, and perseveration. Some patients with severe chorea show an enlargement 
of script described as "choreatic macrographia" (Hochheimer, 1936). 
31-3.4. Gaps in the Literature 
Future investigations may clarify the question of whether language disturbances in 
HD are primary or secondary to motor and cognitive changes of the disease. Longi- 
tudinal studies of language changes in HD would be particularly useful in defining 
the nature of progression of these changes. 
31-4. PROGRESSIVE 
SUPRANUCLEAR 
PALSY 
31-4.1. Clinical Characteristics and Etiology 
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder resembling Par- 
kinson's disease (Steele, Richardson, & Olszewski, 1964). PSP is characterized by 
extrapyramidal rigidity, unsteady gait, supranuclear paralysis of eye movements, and 
prominent dementia. Age of onset is generally around age 55 (range, 45 to 75 years) 
and the clinical picture is often fully developed within 2 to 3 years. In addition to 
rigidity and ophthalomoplegia, pseudobulbar palsy with emotional lability and axial 
dystonia in extension also occur (Agid et al., 1986). Due to the similarities and overlap 
with Parkinson's disease, the actual prevalence of this disease is difficult to determine. 
A rough estimate is that 18% of patients initially diagnosed with PD are found to 
have neuropathological signs of PSP at autopsy (Agid et al., 1986). While the initial 
presenting picture of PSP may mimic Parkinson's disease, these patients do not re- 
spond to anti-Parkinson's medications. Neuropathological changes include neuronal 

31 
Non-Alzheimer's Dementias 
457 
cell loss, gliosis, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain stem, basal ganglia, and 
cerebellar nuclei (Steele et al., 1964). 
31-4.2. Cognitive Changes 
Early cognitive impairments are major aspects of PSP (Kimura, Barnett, & Burkhart, 
1981; Pillon et al., 1995; Steele et al., 1964). Albert, Feldman, and Willis (1974) 
originally described the cognitive impairments of PSP as characteristic of a "subcor- 
tical dementia." Rosser and Hodges (1994b) also found that in comparison to AD 
and HD, PSP patients were less impaired on memory and attention measures and 
more impaired on verbal fluency and abstraction. Maher, Smith, and Lees (1985) and 
Pillon et al. (1995) found that PSP patients have difficulty performing executive func- 
tion tasks such as verbal fluency. Cambier, Masson, Viader, Limodier, and Strube 
(1985) found frontal executive and related deficits that included mental slowing, im- 
paired attention, reduced verbal fluency, poor abstract thinking and reasoning, dynamic 
apraxia, motor impersistence, and imitation and utilization behaviors. Although neu- 
ropathological findings of PSP do not indicate lesions in the frontal cortex, PET studies 
have demonstrated a significant reduction in cerebral glucose utilization in the frontal 
lobes (D'Antona et al., 1985), likely due to decreased activation from subcortical 
neuronal afferents (Agid et al., 1986). 
31-4.3. Overall Speech and Language Changes 
Dysarthria is one of the most striking features of PSP. It is among the earliest symp- 
toms and may progress to complete anarthria (Steele, 1972). Other changes include 
decreased verbal fluency, decreased comprehension of complex commands, and dis- 
turbed reading and writing. 
31-4.3.1. Verbal Communication 
In PSE communicative disability results primarily from the general mental slowing 
and dysarthria (Podoll, Schwarz, & Noth, 1991). PSP patients may be loquacious and 
rambling in their speech in the early stages (David, Mackey, & Smith, 1968; Messert 
& Nuis, 1966); however, much more characteristic of PSP is a slow rate, a low volume, 
and a flat prosody. The latencies between questions and the patients' responses may 
be inordinately long (Albert et al., 1974; David et al., 1968). Palilalia and other re- 
iterative speech changes may occur (Rafal & Grimm, 1981). The dysarthria of PSP 
may be so severe that speech utterances are only poorly intelligible, and in the later 
stages of the disease, most patients are mute (Albert et al., 1974; David et al., 1968; 
Janati & Appel, 1984). Occasionally, patients have been able to communicate by 
writing or blinking or movements of the extremities when they have been rendered 
completely mute (David et al., 1968). Syntactic structure, semantic understanding, and 
lexical access appear intact. 

458 
Monique M. Cherrier et al. 
31-4.3.2. Comprehension 
Podoll et al. (1991) found that PSP patients had impaired comprehension for complex 
visual or verbal information. Their performance on these tasks correlated significantly 
with impairment on the Comprehension subtest of the WAIS. Simple, one-step com- 
prehension may be preserved. Rosser & Hodges (1994b) found that only 20% of PSP 
patients demonstrated impaired performance in simple comprehension items on a de- 
mentia rating scale. 
31-4.3.3. Confrontation Naming and Repetition 
Several but not all studies report confrontation naming and repetition to be preserved 
in PSP patients (Alpert, Rosen, Welkowitz, & Lieberman, 1990; Maher et al., 1985; 
Podoll et al., 1991). In one study, naming errors were visually related to the item, 
suggesting that the naming deficit results from an impairment at the encoding stage 
of naming where the processes of visual perception are involved (Kimura et al., 1981; 
Maher et al., 1985; Rafal & Grimm, 1981). 
31-4.3.4. Reading and Writing 
In PSE reading aloud is slow with pronunciation errors due to dysarthria. Some pa- 
tients read dysfluently, deciphering words in a hesitant, disconnected manner (David 
et al., 1968; Dix, Harrison, & Lewis, 1971; Podoll et al., 1991). PSP patients may 
also have difficulty reading due to a disturbance in visual registration during reading, 
possibly related to the occulomotor disorder (Dix et al., 1971). Writing is also slow 
due to the loss of fine motor movement. Abnormal slanting and micrographia are 
evident. Dysgraphic errors included omissions or perseverations of letters and words. 
Copying words is compromised by difficulties in shifting gaze from model to copy 
and the paralysis of downward gaze makes writing particularly difficult. 
31-4.4. Gaps in the Literature 
In general, the literature regarding language and cognitive changes for PSP is sparse. 
The diagnosis of PSP is difficult to make early in the disease and a confident diagnosis 
may not emerge until the patient is no longer able to withstand testing. Postmortem 
confirmation and retrospective studies will help shed light on the early signs of lan- 
guage deficits in PSR 
31-5. CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE 
31-5.1. Clinical Characteristics and Etiology 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and rapidly progressive dementia caused by 
an infectious agent (Prusiner, 1987). Death usually occurs 5-6 months after onset, 

31 
Non-Alzheimer's Dementias 
459 
although rare cases last years (Mendez, 1994). In the early stages of CJD, the diagnosis 
may be difficult due to the variation and complexity of the presenting features 
(Drobny, Krajnak, Svalekova, & Pithova, 1991; Van Rossum, 1972). In addition to 
cognitive decline, commonly occurring initial signs include fatigue, emotional lability, 
mood disorders, and even psychosis. CJD is also characterized by early abnormalities 
in the pyramidal, extrapyramidal, cerebellar, oculomotor, or other neurologial systems. 
In the middle to late stages, muscular rigidity, spasticity, loss of consciousness, and 
advanced pyramidal or extrapyramidal motor dysfunction occur. The presence of star- 
tle myoclonus and periodic complexes on EEG are the most helpful for the clinical 
diagnosis of CJD (Drobny et al., 1991). 
31-5.2. Cognitive Changes 
Memory and cognition decline early in the disease in a pattern suggestive of fron- 
tal-subcortical involvement (Drobny et al., 1991). There is a decline in sustained and 
divided attention and concentration. Confusion and disorientation are common along 
with bradyphrenia and confabulation (Van Rossum, 1972). In a review of 33 CJD 
patients, a pattern of deficits further suggestive of frontal systems dysfunction included 
impaired digit span and poor interpretation of similarities (Maher et al., 1985). 
31-5.3. Overall Speech and Language Changes 
Dysarthria is the most common speech symptom and may be of bulbar, pseudobulbar, 
cerebellar, or extrapyramidal origin (Van Rossum, 1972). The combination of rigidity 
affecting the speech muscles along with apathy and loss of initiative often results in 
mutism. Echolalia also occurs possibly as a consequence of frontal-subcortical circuit 
dysfunction. In a retrospective study of 12 CJD patients, five developed language 
difficulties indicating the variability of language changes (Drobny et al., 1991). 
Investigators have reported an absence of primary language impairment among 
patients with CJD (Maher et al., 1985); however, McPherson et al. (1994) documented 
a case of CJD who presented primarily with mixed transcortical aphasia including 
nonfluent spontaneous speech and impaired comprehension. Moreover, there was rel- 
ative preservation of repetition and grammatical rules. In addition, Mandell, Alexan- 
der, and Carpenter (1989) reported a case of CJD presenting as a primary progressive 
(fluent) aphasia. Subsequent clinicopathologic studies of primary progressive aphasia 
indicate that CJD is a potential cause of an early, isolated, and insidious aphasia. 
31-6. PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE APHASIA 
31-6.1. Clinical Characteristics and Etiology 
In primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language disorder develops in relative iso- 
lation to other cognitive changes until later stages. Mesulam (1982) originally de- 

460 
Monique M. Cherrier et al. 
scribed six patients with primary progressive aphasia that did not evidence intellectual 
declines until very late stages of the disease. In fact, many of his patients continued 
to work at part-time jobs or remained active in civic duties and managed their personal 
finances. Reasoning and judgment abilities remained intact for many of these patients 
despite language deterioration to the point of muteness. Some patients, however, had 
early evidence of apraxia or acalculia (Poeck & Luzzatti, 1988). 
PPA manifests as either a dysfluency with decreased verbal fluency or a semantic 
anomia. Patients with primary progressive aphasia are generally able to convey in- 
formation effectively, if not by speech, then by written messages, gestures, and even 
sign language. Because this condition is rare, incidence and prevalence rates are dif- 
ficult to assess; however, on neuropathology many if not all of these patients prove 
to have frontotemporal dementia and some have Alzheimer's disease or CJD or some 
other dementing illness. Neuroimaging often discloses focal degeneration of the left 
perisylvian region. 
31-6.2. Overall Speech and Language Changes 
In the dysfluent subtype of PPA, spontaneous speech is slow, hesitant, and sometimes 
agrammatic (Karbe, Kertesz, & Polk, 1993). Patients typically complain of difficulties 
in expressing themselves and finding the right word. As a result, lengthy descriptions 
or responses are difficult and generally avoided. In the advanced stages of aphasia, 
speech is characterized by logopenia, long word-finding pauses, circumlocution, rare 
paraphasias, and dysarthria (Mesulam, 1982; Scholten, Kneebone, Denson, Fields, & 
B lumbergs, 1995). Phonemic paraphasias and verbal stereotypes may be present 
(Karbe et al., 1993). In the semantic anomia subtype of PPA, naming deficits are the 
most prominent symptom along with word-finding difficulties in spontaneous speech 
(Karbe et al., 1993; Scholten et al., 1995). These patients have difficulty in compre- 
hending the meaning of words. In general, PPA is of specific interest because of the 
relatively isolated nature of language difficulty, at least early in the disorder. PPA most 
probably represents an atypical presentation of AD, CJD, VaD, and Pick's disease, 
and later speech and language changes vary depending on the nature of the underlying 
disease. 
31-7. SUMMARY 
AND CONCLUSIONS 
In summary, disturbances in language and communication are often prominent symp- 
toms in dementing illnesses. Many dementing illnesses lead to aphasia, others pri- 
marily impair verbal fluency or result in motor speech disturbances such as dysarthria. 
The language deficits in vascular dementia (VaD) usually include poor verbal fluency 
and decreased confrontation naming. These deficits generally reflect the disturbances 
of ischemic insults in VaD. The frontotemporal dementias (FTD) such as Pick's disease 
produce a progressive reduction of speech, stereotypy of speech, echolalia, and per- 
severation. Among patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and progressive supra- 

31 
Non-Alzheimer's Dementias 
461 
nuclear palsy (PSP), motor impairments impact speech, resulting in dysarthria and 
sometimes complete communicative disability (anarthria). Similarly, Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease (CJD) produces dysarthria of bulbar, pseudobulbar, cerebellar, or extrapy- 
ramidal type along with aphasia in the middle to late stages. Patients with primary 
progressive aphasia (PPA) demonstrate a wide variety of aphasic symptoms, with 
relative sparing of other cognitive abilities. Although substantial information is avail- 
able regarding language changes in dementia, controversies remain regarding the 
extent and nature of language deficits, and further research is needed with well- 
characterized patient groups, standardized testing procedures, and longitudinal follow- 
up measures to more fully understand the complex communicative manifestations of 
dementing illnesses.

Language disturbances may appear early in the course of dementia of the Al- 
zheimer type (DAT) and become frequent as the disease progresses. Moreover, 
the presence of language impairment seems to be associated with a faster cog- 
nitive and functional decline. The profile of the linguistic changes depends on the 
stage of the disease, with anomia and impairment in verbal fluency tests being 
early and prominent features. In the initial and intermediate phases of the disease 
there is a marked lexical and discourse deficit, characterizing a semantic im- 
pairment, with preservation of syntactic and phonological abilities. This semantic 
deficit is probably secondary to pathological involvement of the temporal neo- 
cortex, an anatomical region related to lexical retrieval. In later stages, all lan- 
guage components become involved. 
Dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) is the leading cause of dementia in most 
countries, accounting for more than half of all dementia cases (Canadian Study of

Health and Aging Working Group, 1994; Nitrini et al., 1995). Its prevalence ranges 
from 1% among individuals 65 to 74 years old to 26% at age 85 and older (Ca- 
nadian Study of Health and Aging Working Group, 1994). Clinically, DAT is char- 
acterized by progressive memory loss associated with decline in other cognitive do- 
mains, such as attention, language, visuospatial, and constructional abilities, as well 
as behavioral changes. Memory disorders are among the first symptoms of the disease. 
Language disturbances may occur as early symptoms in DAT and become more 
frequent as the disease progresses. A wide scope of research has been developed, 
especially in the last decade, aiming at determining not only the frequency of language 
deficits in DAT, but also characterizing and interpreting the clinical picture of these 
linguistic changes. 
The goal of this chapter is to present and discuss the current data on language and 
communication disorders in DAT. The profile of the linguistic changes and the evo- 
lution of these deficits over the course of the disease are presented first, followed by 
a brief discussion about the specificity of the linguistic changes. The relationships 
between language impairment and subgroups of DAT patients are then outlined. Fi- 
nally, the neuropathological correlates of language impairment are shown and some 
current research trends in this field are pointed out. Emphasis will be placed on recent 
studies and ideas, and also on classic works that constitute the basis of contemporary 
research. 
32-1. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LINGUISTIC 
CHANGES IN DAT 
Most of the studies focusing on language disturbances in DAT have compared de- 
mented patients with brain-damaged subjects (especially stroke and head trauma) and 
elderly controls. The language profile of DAT presented in the literature has been 
mainly traced from the instruments usually employed in aphasia diagnosis, such as 
the Western Aphasia Battery and the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Cum- 
mings, Benson, Hill, & Read, 1985; Cummings, Darkins, Mendez, Hill, & Benson, 
1988; Kertesz, Appell, & Fisman, 1986). Tests usually include examination of ver- 
bal fluency, naming, auditory and reading comprehension, repetition, reading aloud, 
and discourse abilities. Another method of investigation is based on assessment of 
performance in communication situations. The seminal work of Irigaray (1973), us- 
ing language batteries and conversation, drew attention to some special character- 
istics of language in dementia and set the basis for many of the later studies in this 
area. 
The frequency of language disturbances in DAT seems to depend on the severity 
of dementia, ranging from 36% to 100%, respectively, in mild and severe cases (Faber- 
Langendoen 1988). The linguistic changes found in DAT, in language comprehension 
and production, are described in the following sections. 

32 
Language and Communication in DAT 
465 
32-1.1. Language Comprehension 
32-1.1.1. Auditory Skills 
Impairment in auditory comprehension in DAT is progressively greater the higher the 
complexity of information. Hence, patients display preserved comprehension of simple 
commands and questions, with trouble in understanding complex sentences that in- 
volve inferences, comparisons, or causal relationships (Appel, Kertesz, & Fisman, 
1982; Cummings et al., 1985). 
Hart (1988) evaluated the performance of DAT patients in the Token Test and found 
a correlation between the results in this test and those obtained by the same patients 
in the Wechsler Memory Scale, suggesting that the memory deficits may interfere in 
auditory comprehension tests. However, the patients showed difficulties in the final 
part of the test, which has similar requirements of short-term verbal memory to the 
previous sections, but is of greater linguistic complexity. 
Additional factors must also be considered in interpreting these data, such as the 
extension of the material to be understood (number of propositions) and the role of 
the postinterpretive stage of sentence comprehension. Postinterpretation refers to the 
organization of verbal material, which entails the integration with nonlinguistic ca- 
pacities, such as visual and memory abilities. Waters, Caplan, and Rochon (1995) 
have studied 14 mild to moderate DAT patients, showing that the postinterpretive 
stage is affected in the disease. 
32-1.1.2. Reading Skills 
Reading comprehension is affected early in the course of DAT and is considered 
to be more seriously affected than auditory comprehension (Hart, 1988). Faber- 
Langendoen et al. (1988) report that the deficits in reading comprehension seem to 
be more sensitive indicators of the language disturbance in DAT than anomia. Bayles, 
Tomoeda, and Trosset (1992), however, examining patients at different stages of the 
disease, observed that reading comprehension is relatively stable in mild and moderate 
cases. However, these studies have analyzed only the comprehension of single written 
words, which clearly limits the interpretation of these data. 
Reading aloud is relatively preserved in DAT (Cummings et al., 1985), although 
in many cases patients are able to read but without understanding (Hart, 1988). The 
published data indicate that reading comprehension is affected more than auditory 
comprehension and reading aloud in DAT. 
32-1.2. Language Production 
32-1.2.1. Oral Skills 
Oral production is the linguistic aspect of DAT that has received the greatest attention 
in recent studies. For this reason, this section will be divided by different linguistic 

466 
Paulo Caramelli et al. 
levels: phonology, syntax, and semantics, the latter being addressed in lexical tasks 
and discourse. 
32-1.2.1.1. Phonological and Syntactic Abilities 
In virtually all studies on language disturbances in DAT, phonological abilities have 
been found to be unimpaired, a feature that allows these patients to be classified as 
fluent (Bayles, 1994). This characteristic has favored the development of increasing 
research on the semantic and syntactic aspects of language in DAT. 
Syntactic abilities are relatively well preserved, at least in early and intermediate 
stages (Bayles, 1982; Kempler, Curtiss, & Jackson, 1987). Bayles (1982) reports that 
DAT patients are able to repeat totally incoherent sentences, and to correct sentences 
containing syntactic errors. However, it has been argued that syntactic competence is 
limited to routine contexts and that deficits may emerge in situations demanding the 
use of propositional syntax, that is, requiring a higher level of voluntary generation 
(Patel & Satz, 1994). Furthermore, the employment of correct syntax could be merely 
a reflection of a stereotypical and automatic procedure (Cardebat, D6monet, Puel, 
Nespoulous, & Rascol, 1991). 
The relative preservation of phonological and syntactic abilities stands in sharp 
opposition to the semantic impairment, one of the most characteristic language traits 
in DAT. 
32-1.2.1.2. Semantic Abilities 
Semantic abilities are markedly impaired in DAT, contrasting with preserved pho- 
nological/syntactic capacities. This dissociation was highlighted by the work of 
Irigaray (1973). Many later studies confirmed that the semantic disturbances con- 
stitute a main feature of the linguistic changes in DAT (Bayles, 1982; Bayles & 
Tomoeda, 1983; Huff, Corkin, & Growdon, 1986). In these studies, semantic abil- 
ities are basically assessed through naming and verbal fluency tasks, as well as in 
discourse. 
32-1.2.1.3. Naming Tasks 
Lexico-semantic disturbances are clearly evident in confrontation naming tests. Ano- 
mia constitutes one of the most common and earliest linguistic changes in DAT (Bay- 
les et al., 1992). In mild stages, confrontation naming errors consist mainly in pro- 
duction of superordinate labels and semantic-related attributes (Bayles, Tomoeda, & 
Trosset, 1990; Hodges, Salmon, & Butters, 1991). Circumlocutions also occur. These 
features indicate a loss of detailed knowledge, that is, the attributes of a specific item 
within a category, which is a major putative cause for anomia in DAT, and contrasts 
with the preservation of superordinate knowledge of semantic categorization (Chert- 
kow & Bub, 1990; Martin & Fedio, 1983). As dementia progresses, semantic-related 
errors become more frequent and circumlocutions decrease, suggesting a reduction in 
the specificity of the semantic information available (Hodges et al., 1991). These 
deficits have a clear impact on discourse (Glosser & Deser, 1990). 

32 
Language and Communication in DAT 
467 
32-1.2.1.4. Verbal Fluency Tasks 
Verbal fluency, assessed through the production in a limited time of a list of words 
belonging to the same semantic category, is usually reduced in DAT. Some investi- 
gations suggest that this is a useful screening test for the diagnosis (Monsch et al., 
1992; Nitrini et al., 1994), as well as for the prediction, of dementia (Masur, Sliwinski, 
Lipton, Blau, & Crystal, 1994). 
Another interesting feature disclosed by some studies is that patients present a 
weaker performance in tests of verbal fluency with semantic criteria when compared 
to letter criteria, that is, words initiated by the same letter (Monsch et al., 1992; 
Pasquier, Lebert, Grymonprez, & Petit, 1995). This finding suggests that the lexico- 
semantic impairment may, in part, explain the reduction in verbal fluency. However, 
it must be considered that these verbal fluency tasks are time-constrained and thus 
could be evaluating not only fluency (and semantics) but also other aspects of cog- 
nition (Faber-Langendoen et al., 1988). 
32-1.2.1.5. Nature of the Lexico-Semantic Deficit 
Two possibilities must be considered regarding the nature of the lexico-semantic def- 
icit: an access deficit to the semantic system or a disintegration of the system itself, 
with loss of previously established concepts. 
Several studies addressed this question. Huff et al. (1986) selected a group of DAT 
patients without evidence of visuoperceptual deficits and submitted them to a naming 
test. Subsequently, they compared the anomia of these patients with the results ob- 
tained in a comprehension test including the same items used in the naming task. The 
authors observed a close correlation between the results in the two tasks, as the pa- 
tients presented difficulties in comprehending the same items that they were unable 
to name. 
Additional data came from the study of Chertkow and Bub (1990). These authors 
selected 10 patients with DAT, without any evidence of visuoperceptual deficits, and 
compared them to 10 matched elderly controls in different tasks assessing semantic 
memory: picture naming, word-to-picture matching (using the same words of the 
picture-naming task), verbal fluency, semantic cueing, superordinate knowledge, and 
semantic priming). The patients showed consistency of errors between the picture- 
naming and the matching tasks, loss of semantic cueing, and preservation of super- 
ordinate knowledge with marked deficit of detailed knowledge. 
Therefore, both studies suggest that there is a destruction of the semantic system 
in DAT. Further investigations also support this notion (Henderson, Mack, Freed, 
Kempler, & Andersen, 1990; Hodges, Salmon, & Butters, 1992). However, since most 
of these studies have included mild and moderate cases, the occurrence of an access 
deficit in very mild cases (i.e., in the early pathological stages of the disease) is still 
not ruled out. 
32-1.2.1.6. Discourse 
The analysis of communication possibilities in DAT has been based on models that 
take into account linguistic and extralinguistic aspects. There are only a few studies 

468 
Paulo Caramelli et al. 
addressing the semantic-pragmatic aspects related to nonlinguistic contexts. Most of 
these investigations have been conducted through assessment of narrative and con- 
versation, comparing speech samples from DAT subjects to Wernicke's aphasics and 
elderly controls. 
The studies of the pragmatic-conceptual aspects have reinforced the notion that 
semantic disintegration is at the root of the linguistic changes in DAT. These prag- 
matic-conceptual aspects were studied in relation to language formulation and to ref- 
erential coherence and relevance, which support the global organization of the oral 
text. 
B lanken, Dittmann, Haas, and Wallesch (1987), and Glosser and Deser (1990) 
found that DAT patients have preserved language formulation and thus are able to 
deal with isolated propositions, but have difficulty in organizing them as a whole. 
Further, Glosser and Deser verified that patients have difficulty in employing the mark- 
ers of referential coherence. B lanken et al. suggest that the deficits lie in the conceptual 
structure of the intended speech act. 
Fromm and Holland (1989) further investigated this aspect of communication. They 
analyzed speech acts produced by mild and moderate DAT subjects, Wernicke's apha- 
sics, and elderly depressed in a role-playing situation. The comparison of DAT patients 
with depressed subjects allowed these authors to exclude the influence of motivational 
aspects on the impairment of speech acts production. Performance of both subgroups 
of DAT patients was impaired in the more complex cognitive processing (divergencies, 
utilization of context, reading, calculating, and sequential relations), while overlearned 
communicative acts, such as social conventions, remained relatively preserved. 
More recently, Marcie, Roudier, and Boller (1994), and Mentis, Briggs-Whittaker, 
and Gramigna (1995) evaluated oral texts produced by DAT patients and detected 
irrelevant and incomplete units, as well as units unrelated to the topic under discussion, 
leading to a rupture in the development of the topic. Moreover, Mentis et al. (1995) 
also analyzed the ability to introduce and change topics and observed a difficulty in 
introducing and shifting topics in an active and coherent way during conversation, 
which increased the responsibility of the conversational partner. 
Although these studies have examined orally produced texts with different methods, 
they generally suggest that in DAT there is a loss of competence in managing the 
totality of semantic units, and a difficulty in integrating cognitive and linguistic com- 
ponents during development of the discourse. 
This inability to deal with the discourse as a whole may be considered secondary 
to memory troubles, an aspect addressed by the work of Ska and Gu6nard (1993). 
They analyzed the basic semantic structure of narrative production (narrative schema) 
in early stage DAT patients in comparison to controls. The two groups were submitted 
to three distinct tasks: the first without image support (to tell a well-known children's 
story), and the remaining two involving presentation of images (single or sequenced 
pictures). The patients produced fewer schema components than the controls in all 
three situations. They made more errors in sequencing the reported events and pro- 
duced a greater number of irrelevant propositions. Even in visually supported tasks, 
the performance of patients was affected, thus excluding episodic memory disturbance 
as the primary cause for the narrative production impairment in the disease. Further 

32 
Language and Communication in DAT 
469 
studies, however, are still necessary to clarify the relationships between language and 
cognition in DAT. 
32-1.2.2. Writing Skills 
Writing skills have not been studied as much as oral production in DAT, and to date 
most of the studies are mainly descriptive. Horner, Heyman, Dawson, and Rogers 
(1988) submitted 20 DAT patients to a test of describing an image in writing. They 
observed poor organization, perseverations, intrusions, verbal paragraphias, grammat- 
ical and orthographic errors, and also spatial agraphia associated with difficulty in 
letter formation. Although this study evaluates writing skills in a textual situation, the 
authors' analysis pertains only to the word and sentence levels and does not discuss 
the global structure of the text. 
Henderson, Buckwalter, Sobel, Freed, and Diz (1992) evaluated narrative writing 
material from 33 DAT patients and compared them to 41 matched-controls, and found 
that the patients had lower writing scores, wrote fewer words, mentioned fewer cat- 
egories of information, and made significantly more writing errors. The poor perform- 
ance in the narrative writing task correlated with severity of dementia. 
In another study, Croisile, Adeleine, Carmoi, Aimard, and Trillet (1995) examined 
42 DAT patients and 30 controls by employing a protocol based on writing regular 
and irregular words, as well as neologisms, from dictation. The patients performed 
worse than the control group in the dictation task for all three word categories, with 
more difficulty in writing irregular words, a finding similar to the one reported by 
Rapcsak, Arthur, Bliklen, and Rubens (1989). The spelling errors correlated with over- 
all language deficits and also with the severity of dementia. Furthermore, the authors 
observed a word-frequency effect in the writing task. These features suggest that a 
lexical deficit occurs at the orthographic level in DAT. 
Hence, writing disturbances are frequent in DAT, being present even in early phases 
of the disease and correlating with severity of dementia. These data assign a clear 
diagnostic potential for writing evaluation in DAT patients. A study by Snowdon et 
al., (1996) added another dimension to the importance of semantic and syntactic writ- 
ing skills. These authors analyzed autobiographic texts written by 93 Catholic nuns 
when they were young. They found that measures of low idea density and low gram- 
matical complexity were strongly related to a diagnosis of DAT in late life. Although 
this study may be somewhat controversial in its subjacent theory of DAT, it suggests 
that reduced writing skills in early life may have a potential predictive value for the 
development of dementia in old age. 
32-2. EVOLUTION OF THE LINGUISTIC 
CHANGES IN DAT 
According to several works, a relatively typical language course occurs in DAT, which 
is generally characterized by three phases (Cardebat et al., 1991; Bayles, 1994). 

470 
Paulo Caramelli et al. 
In the early stages of the disease, communication is already impaired: the patient 
may have difficulty in initiating conversation and in understanding humor, sarcasm, 
verbal analogies, and indirect propositions. Anomia is the most striking trait, associ- 
ated with circumlocutions and rare verbal paraphasias. Furthermore, oral expression 
shows a qualitative output reduction, with omission of items and the use of somewhat 
generic and imprecise terms at the lexical level, as well as in sentence generation. 
The phonetic, phonemic, and syntactic aspects of language are preserved. Reading 
comprehension and writing show signs of impairment. Auditory comprehension is 
relatively unaffected, except for new information and situations demanding abstrac- 
tion. Repetition and reading aloud are preserved. Some authors identify this clinical 
picture with that of anomic aphasia. 
In a more advanced stage, semantic abilities are severely impaired, with paucity of 
ideas leading to frequent repetitions. Phonetic and phonological stability is still evi- 
dent. However, at the syntactic level, speech production is fragmented. Automatisms 
are used as compensatory strategies. Anomia becomes even more frequent. Verbal and 
semantic paraphasias, occasionally associated with neologisms, emerge. There is con- 
siderable worsening of writing as well as of reading and auditory comprehension, 
especially for complex segments. Repetition, and even reading aloud (although to a 
lesser degree), are usually preserved. Therefore, the clinical profile is sometimes com- 
pared to transcortical sensory aphasia (Cummings et al., 1985), although patients pre- 
sent less paraphasias and echolalias than the aphasics with cerebrovascular etiology 
and with worse performance than the latter in overlearned tasks like recitation. 
In the final stage of the disease, all linguistic functions are impaired, with marked 
reduction in oral expression and severe problems of comprehension. Only some au- 
tomatisms and verbal perseverations may persist. In a few patients repetition is still 
possible, leading to echolalia. This feature has been described as resembling global 
aphasia. 
32-3. SPECIFICITY 
OF THE 
LINGUISTIC 
CHANGES 
The diagnosis of DAT is essentially based on widely accepted clinical criteria, but 
without objective markers. An important issue is to discuss how far the analysis of 
language could contribute to the diagnosis, that is, if there are specific linguistic mark- 
ers of DAT. In this sense, a clear limitation is that DAT manifests itself at an age of 
natural neurobiological and cognitive decline and of increased susceptibility to the 
development of language impairment secondary to other neurological diseases. Hence, 
overlapping diseases, or even aging, could be affecting the performance. 
The analysis of symptoms detected in language evaluations of elderly individuals, 
aphasics, right brain-damaged and demented patients reveals marked similarities. 
All linguistic symptoms may be common to these populations, namely, anomia, dif- 
ficulties in textual and complex syntactic comprehension, reduction of informational 
content, increased discourse tangentiality, and referential errors (Chapman & Ula- 
towska, 1994).

It is clear, therefore, that the search for the nature of these deficits is of central 
importance for the differential diagnosis. In the case of DAT, it implies a need to 
identify the relationships between different language components and between lan- 
guage and other aspects of cognition. In this sense, discourse, in all modalities, is the 
ideal situation for this analysis, since its formulation involves comprehension and 
arrangement of the information in a meaningful way (Chapman & Ulatowska, 1994). 
However, to date there have been very few attempts to make use of discourse material 
in order to identify specific linguistic and cognitive markers of DAT. 
32-4. INFLUENCE 
OF NON-LINGUISTIC 
DEFICITS 
ON LANGUAGE 
IMPAIRMENT 
Different clinical factors during the course of DAT may interact with language, making 
it difficult to interpret the linguistic data. Tasks that imply extensive auditory input, 
for example, may be affected by the global cognitive decline, especially by memory. 
In this sense, visual support can rule out the interference of memory functions; how- 
ever, it introduces a new bias in the case of the occurrence of visual agnosias. 
32-4.1. Visuoperceptual Problems 
As already discussed, several works supporting the involvement of the semantic as- 
pects of language in DAT were based on the poor performance of patients in con- 
frontation naming of objects and figures. Thus, visuoperceptual problems could have 
an effect on these tasks. Appel et al. (1982) have shown that DAT patients improve 
their performance on naming tasks through tactile stimulation. In another study, Shut- 
tleworth and Huber (1988) observed that performance in naming real objects was 
better than in confrontation naming of line drawings. Other studies, however, do not 
corroborate these data (Bayles, 1982; Bayles & Tomoeda, 1983). 
Differences in the profiles of cognitive impairment may explain the discrepancies 
found in these studies. Neuropsychological manifestations of DAT are heterogeneous. 
Major subgroups may be identified according to the prominence of some specific 
cognitive deficits, such as visuoperceptual impairment (Neary et al., 1986). It is clear 
that in these patients the visual deficit might influence their performance in language 
tests, especially in confrontation naming. 
32-4.2. Memory Problems 
Language and verbal communication depend very much on knowledge of the world, 
on linguistic knowledge, and on expertise in manipulating the rules of linguistic usage, 
which pertain to the domain of semantic memory. On the other hand, they also depend 
on short-term verbal memory capacities. Short-term and long-term (semantic and ep- 
isodic) memory are significantly impaired in DAT. Recent works have investigated 

472 
Paulo Carameili et al. 
the degree of interdependence of short-term memory and language in DAT, although 
there are no definite conclusions (Patel & Satz, 1994; Waters et al., 1995). 
Episodic memory relates to autobiographical experience and thus represents an 
obvious prerequisite for communicative activities. Bayles and Tomoeda have proposed 
a specific test for language evaluation in dementia, the Arizona Battery for Commu- 
nication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD; Bayles & Tomoeda, 1991 as cited in Bayles, 
1994). Besides the examination of linguistic comprehension and expression, the 
ABCD includes additional tasks for cognitive components that clearly interact with 
language, such as verbal episodic memory. The use of such a battery in further studies 
may help to clarify the relationship between memory functions and language in DAT. 
32-5. LANGUAGE 
IMPAIRMENT 
IN DAT: 
A MARKER 
FOR CLINICAL 
SUBGROUPS? 
The presence and the severity of linguistic changes have been considered in some 
studies as possible indicators of particular clinical subtypes of DAT, although some 
data are still controversial. It has been postulated that there are significant differences 
between presenile (onset before 65 years) and senile (onset after 65 years) forms of 
DAT. Accordingly, several authors have found more frequent and even more promi- 
nent language disturbances in presenile DAT (Chui, Teng, Henderson, & Moy, 1985; 
Koss, et al.; 1996; Lawlor, Ryan, Schmeidler, Mohs, & Davis, 1994). 
Other studies found a relationship between language disturbances and family his- 
tory of dementia, suggesting that these features could be an indicator of familial DAT 
(Duara et al., 1993; Folstein & Breitner, 1981). However, Chui et al. (1985) and, more 
recently, Swearer, O'Donnell, Drachman, and Woodward (1992) did not observe a 
higher frequency, nor a higher severity, of language disturbances in this particular 
group of patients. A less controversial finding is the positive correlation between the 
presence of linguistic changes and a faster progression of dementia (Boller et al., 1991; 
Bracco et al., 1994; Faber-Langendoen et al., 1988). 
32-6. NEUROPATHOLOGICAL 
CORRELATES 
OF LINGUISTIC 
CHANGES 
Classically, linguistic changes in DAT have been ascribed to the involvement of the 
left-temporo-parieto-occipital junction area (Cummings et al., 1985; Delay & Brion, 
1962). However, in the initial stages of the disease, the neuropathological process 
affects the medial temporal lobe, especially the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus 
(Braak & Braak, 1991). The temporal lobe bears the brunt of the disease as the 
pathological process advances. Neocortical areas of the temporal lobe, such as the 
temporal pole and the middle and inferior temporal gyria, are also affected, and this 
probably occurs before the involvement of the temporo-parieto-occipital junction. 

32 
Language and Communication in DAT 
473 
Recent studies reveal that damage to the left temporal neocortex, particularly the 
middle and inferior temporal gyria, and to the temporal pole, severely impairs the 
ability to retrieve words, but is not accompanied by any grammatical or phonemic 
defects (Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio 1996; Semenza & Zettin, 
1989). It is likely that anomia and reduction in verbal fluency tests seen in DAT 
depend on the involvement of these areas. 
As already mentioned, syntactic and phonological abilities are relatively preserved 
in the initial phases of DAT. Patel and Satz (1994) state that the perisylvian/peri- 
Rolandic cortex, which are the neuroanatomical structures responsible for these lan- 
guage mechanisms, must be intact at this stage. 
As the disease progresses, the temporo-parieto-occipital junction area is also af- 
fected, and it is likely that the involvement of this area is responsible for the clinical 
profile similar to transcortical sensory aphasia usually described in the moderate stages 
of the disease. In the final stages of the disease, extension of the neuropathological 
process to the frontal regions may contribute to the marked reduction of spontaneous 
speech production seen in severe DAT patients. 
32-7. CONCLUSIONS 
Language disturbances may occur as early symptoms in DAT and are characterized 
by poor performance in naming and verbal fluency tests. As the disease progresses, 
linguistic changes become more frequent, and semantic problems predominate over 
syntactic and phonological problems. Efforts have been made to investigate the nature 
of these linguistic deficits, although some questions still remain open. One major issue 
has to do with the specificity of the linguistic changes since virtually no language 
feature seems to be exclusive to DAT, given the test instruments employed so far. 
Future studies on language function in DAT will have to include longitudinal data 
in order to better characterize the evolution of the linguistic changes, particularly in 
relation to the neuropsychological heterogeneity that occurs with the disease and that 
may probably arise as well in the language domain. This approach would also allow 
the determination of whether the language disturbances are consistently related to 
specific subgroups of DAT. Furthermore, evaluation of very mild DAT cases might 
help to ascertain whether a deficit in semantic access could be present in the very 
early stages of the disease. 
The systematic use of neuroimaging methods, in particular magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and Positron Emission Tomography, allied with care- 
fully elaborated language tests, might substantially advance the comprehension of the 
anatomic-functional correlates of language function in DAT. In relation to language 
tests, it is important to develop highly sensitive batteries that are specific to the lan- 
guage functions likely to be impaired in dementia. For this reason, assessment of 
discourse abilities is of great interest, since it is an ideal set for the analysis of language 
and communication abilities, and also for the investigation of their relationships with 
cognition, and especially memory.

Language Impairment 
in Parkinson's Disease

Deficits in verbal fluency and naming, memory and comprehension of verbal 
information, as well impairment in verbal and logical reasoning are frequently 
associated with linguistic performance in Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenera- 
tive disorder primarily involving subcortical structures and the depletion of do- 
paminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Impairment is more pronounced in 
more complex aspects of language processing as in sentence comprehension, un- 
derstanding of relational terms and relative clauses, and in aspects of logical 
reasoning. It is believed that constraints in accessing the cognitive resources 
needed to implement the processing of syntactic and semantic information, as 
well as the disruption of reciprocating neural connections between the basal gan- 
glia with the prefrontal cortex, may explain these observed deficits. 
Parkinsonism is a symptom complex that occurs in a variety of disorders of the central 
nervous system (CNS). The principal locus affected is the pigmented neuronal system 
of the brain stem, with damage to the substantia nigra (SN) as the major site of 
pathological changes. There are a variety of causes and variants of the Parkinsonian 
syndrome, including idiopathic and other multisystem degenerations. The most com- 
mon variant is Parkinson's disease (PD) or idiopathic parkinsonism (i.e., of unknown 
etiology; about 70%; Jellinger, 1986). PD is featured by unilateral or symmetrical

degenerative changes involving mainly the basal ganglia, the central and caudal parts 
of the zona compacta of the SN, the locus coeruleus, and the nucleus basalis of 
Meynert. Frequently associated with this focal neuronal loss is the presence of Lewy 
bodies (Gibb, Scott, & Lees, 1991) or various types of neurofibrillary degeneration. 
This neuropathologic alteration is responsible for the conspicuous motor disorders 
characteristic of PD, which include akinesia, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, altera- 
tions of posture, and tremor at rest (Koller & Hubble, 1992). The diagnosis is based 
on these clinical observations. 
33-1. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
In addition to these deficits in motor function, there is a growing consensus that 
cognitive deficits may be a part of the complex manifestations of PD. The tradi- 
tional view of cognition in PD, perhaps because of James Parkinson's strong denial 
of intellectual changes in the disease that now bears his name, was that the senses 
and intellect are uninjured (Parkinson, 1817). Until recently, impaired cognitive 
functioning was ascribed to "bradyphrenia" (i.e., slow thinking) and few studies 
had addressed empirically the nature of the cognitive changes in PD. Evidence from 
many studies now suggests that at least subtle alterations and deficits in attention 
(Brown & Marsden, 1988), memory (Sagar, Sullivan, Gabrieli, Corkin, & Growdon, 
1988) and procedural learning (Saint-Cyr, Taylor, & Lang, 1988; Allain, Lieury, 
Quemener, & Thomas, 1995) are present in PD. Moreover, similarities between the 
cognitive disorders of PD and those found in patients with frontal cortex lesions 
(Pillon, Dubois, Lhermitte, & Agid, 1986; Taylor, Saint-Cyr, & Lang, 1986) sug- 
gest that deficits in so-called executive functions are part of the clinical picture 
of PD. 
There is also good clinical and experimental evidence of impairment in motor 
aspects of speech (e.g., dysprosody, hypophonia, dysarthria; Darley, Aronson, & 
Brown, 1975; Cohen, Laframboise, Labelle, & Bouchard, 1993) and, until recently, it 
was believed that language abilities were relatively well preserved and showed only 
gradual deterioration with the progression of the disease (Levin & Tomer, 1992; Levin 
& Katzen, 1995; Mahurin, Feher, Nance, Levy, & Pirozzolo, 1992). The first inves- 
tigations of language in PD, using either standard aphasia batteries or WAIS subtests 
(e.g., Bentin, Silverberg, & Gordon, 1981), had generally concluded that language is 
relatively well spared. Mounting evidence, however, strongly suggests that some as- 
pects of linguistic processing are affected in PD, the nature of which still remains to 
be defined. For instance, aphasic symptoms have been reported following lesions of 
the thalamus and the basal ganglia (a structure affected by the depletion of dopami- 
nergic neurons in PD); this suggests that the involvementmdirect or indirectmof sub- 
cortical structures affected in PD may not be confined to speech impairment and may 
encompass language processes as well (Crosson, 1992). At issue, then, is the question 
of whether language deficits are a clear manifestation of PD.

33-2. LANGUAGE 
DEFICITS 
IN PD 
It is well known that PD patients represent a heterogeneous group, with some devel- 
oping dementia or showing some intellectual impairment, and some remaining intel- 
lectually stable or normal. Often, depressive symptoms complement the clinical profile 
of PD, especially in the early stages. The studies that have been conducted on the 
language abilities of PD patients can be grouped into the following categories: verbal 
fluency including naming, organization of verbal information in memory, and com- 
prehension. 
33-2.1. Verbal Fluency and Naming Deficits 
Studies of verbal fluency in PD--measured both by initial letter (phonological fluency) 
and by category retrieval (semantic fluency)--have yielded contradictory results. 
Deficits of initial-letter fluency have been reported (Gurd & Ward, 1989; Gurd, Ward, 
& Hodges, 1990) but these results must be interpreted with caution since it is not 
clear whether the patients in these studies were screened for dementia and depression. 
It has been shown that demented or depressed PD patients perform significantly 
worse than controls on initial-letter fluency tasks (Cummings, Darkins, Mendez, Hill, 
& Benson, 1988; Huber, Shuttleworth, & Freidenberg, 1989; Starkstein, Preziosi, 
Berthier, Bolduc, Mayberg, & Robinson, 1989; Bayles, Trosset, Tomoeda, Montgom- 
ery, & Wilson, 1993) and that naming and word fluency are correlated with severity 
of dementia (Fisher, Gatterer, & Danielczyk, 1988). The majority of studies, however, 
show an absence of deficits in initial-letter fluency with nondemented and nondepres- 
sed PD patients (Miller, 1985; Beatty, Staton, Weir, Monson, & Whitaker, 1989; Han- 
ley, Dewick, Davies, Playfer, & Turnbull, 1990; Raskin, Sliwinski, & Borod, 1992; 
Auriacombe et al., 1992; Cohen, Bouchard, Scherzer, & Whitaker, 1994). 
Deficits in category fluency, on the other hand, are more frequently associated with 
PD (e.g., Beatty & Monson, 1989; Raskin et al., 1992; Auriacombe et al., 1992) but 
a substantial number of studies also fail to find any impairment in semantic fluency 
(e.g., Hanley et al., 1990; Levin, Llabre, & Weiner, 1989; Cohen et al., 1994). In the 
Raskin et al. (1992) study, for example, PD subjects produced fewer semantic clusters 
in cued semantic category tasks than did the control subjects. The authors interpret 
their finding to suggest that this deficit is characteristic of an executive dysfunction 
that interferes with the activation of semantic networks (see also Tweedy, Langer, & 
McDowell, 1982). Hines and Volpe (1985), on the other hand, had previously found 
that PD subjects were unimpaired in their ability to activate semantic memory, as 
revealed by faster reaction times to words following a semantically associated prime. 
Beatty, Monson, and Goodkin (1989) also found that PD subjects who performed 
normally on the Boston Naming Test generated as many specific exemplars and cat- 
egory labels as did controls. Nondemented PD subjects in Beatty and Monson's (1989) 
study, however, showed selective language deficits, suggesting that naming in partic- 
ular can be compromised in subcortical disease. The clinical implications of their 

478 
Henri Cohen 
observations are, however, unclear. In another study, Matison, Mayeux, Rosen, and 
Fahn (1982) have suggested that impaired category fluency, coupled with the diffi- 
culties observed in confrontation naming, may represent a form of cognitive anomia 
that shares the clinical characteristics of the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon seen in 
some aphasics. Again, others have reported mild or no naming deficits in nondemented 
PD patients (e.g., Pirozzolo, Hansch, Mortimer, Webster, & Kuskowski, 1982; Bayles 
& Tomoeda, 1983; Freedman, Rivoria, Butters, Sax, & Feldman, 1984; Levin et al., 
1989) or in PD patients who had undergone sterotactic surgery a decade earlier 
(Gamsu, 1986). Furthermore, Pillon et al. (1986) failed to find naming deficits in PD 
patients matched for impairment with Alzheimer patients on Raven's matrices and 
subtests of the WAIS-R. 
Two general neuroanatomic hypotheses have been put forward to account for some 
of these observed fluency deficits. In one, they may be attributable to lesions in sub- 
cortical structures (basal ganglia and thalamus), and investigation of fluency deficits 
in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, a disease with subcortical degenera- 
tion, adds support to such a notion (e.g., Agid et al., 1986). In the other, lesions to 
the frontal cortical structures are responsible for such fluency deficits (e.g., Ramier & 
Hecaen, 1970), a view that finds agreement with Eslinger and Grattan's (1993) position 
that the frontal lobes play a strategic role in "spontaneous flexibility," a notion similar 
to set shifting discussed in relation to the frontal lobe syndrome. It has been argued 
that fluency tasks rely on the internal control of attention, which is presumed to task 
the limited attentional resources of PD patients. One test of this hypothesis, however, 
does not suggest that this is the case; rather, PD may be associated with a deficit in 
inhibitory attentional resources and an impairment in the maintenance of those internal 
representations that control action (see Downes, Sharp, Costall, Sagar, & Howe, 1993). 
33-2.2. Organization of Verbal Information in Memory 
Memory and learning deficits with verbal material have frequently been reported in 
PD and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 
1987) is the instrument commonly used to evaluate various aspects of verbal learning 
and memory. Briefly, the test consists of three lists of words including a recognition 
list. The first list includes 16 items from four semantic categories; the second list has 
the same structure, with two semantic categories being the same as in the first list. 
The recognition list includes 16 target items from the first list, plus distractors that 
share or do not share semantic or phonological membership with that list. Taylor, 
Saint-Cyr, and Lang (1990) found, in a study using the CVLT, that short-term memory 
was impaired in both free recall and clustering in PD subjects. In a German study 
using CVLT-like stimuli and procedures, overall performance and semantic clustering 
scores were lower for PD subjects (Karamat, Ilmberger, Poewe, & Gerstenbrand, 
1991); the authors suggest that the observed deficit is comparable to that seen in 
normal aging or in subjects with frontal lobe lesions. Buytenhuijs et al. (1994) studied 
the differential influence of external versus internal control on recall performance in 
PD, in an experiment using a Dutch version of the CVLT. Recall according to the 

33 
Language Impairment in PD 
479 
semantic categories was considered to be the result of unprompted, internally gener- 
ated strategy, and recall according to the sequence in which the lists were read by the 
experimenter was viewed as an externally offered strategy. Their results showed that, 
unlike controls who appeared to rely mainly on an internally generated semantic or- 
ganization, PD subjects appeared to adhere more to the externally imposed serial 
sequence. In a study using a French version of the CVLT, deficits were also observed 
on all measures of free recall and source memory, suggesting that the memory im- 
pairment in PD may also include long-term memory (Cohen et al., 1994). Source 
memory is the ability to remember the context within which chunks of information 
have been learned (Taylor et al., 1990). In the CVLT, however, source memory and 
memory for the order of presentation may be confounded; therefore, these results 
must be interpreted with caution. It should also be noted that, in the Cohen et al. 
(1994) study, PD subjects did not differ from control subjects in measures of semantic 
or serial clustering, suggesting that organization of verbal information in memory, in 
PD, presents a complex profile. 
Short-term memory impairment in PD appears to affect the semantic organiza- 
tion of words as well as of drawings and faces in PD. In a study by Raoul, Lieury, 
Decombe, Chauvel, and Allain (1992) with PD and control subjects, results of in- 
terest showed that deficits were material-specific: both overall verbal recall and se- 
mantic organization were lower for PD subjects. Moreover, except for recognition 
of drawings, which was similar in all groups, the young controls performed better 
than the aged controls and the PD subjects in all tests. To explain their results, 
Raoul and colleagues suggest that encoding and organization processes, which de- 
pend on the limited resources and capacity of short-term memory, are negatively af- 
fected in PD. 
There seems to be general agreement that the frontal lobe in part mediates the 
organization of verbal information in memory, and this aspect of frontal lobe function 
is implicated by the pattern of memory impairments observed in PD. Impairment in 
verbal recency discrimination and content recognition have been recognized in both 
depressed and demented PD patients (Sagar et al., 1988) as well as nondepressed and 
nondemented PD patients (Fisher et al., 1988). Moreover, proactive interference, which 
is the progressive decline in recall performance subsequent to intrusion from previ- 
ously presented material, seems to be preserved in PD despite impaired recall (Sagar, 
Sullivan, Cooper, & Jordan, 1991). This would suggest difficulties in effortful proc- 
essing, as is the case with explicit memory, and preservation of more automatic proc- 
esses in PD. 
Strategic processes involved in sequencing may also be impaired in PD, as revealed 
by deficits in reconstructing the temporal ordering of words and drawings (e.g., 
Vriezen & Moscovitch, 1990). An alternate view of the cause of temporal ordering 
deficits in PD implicates effects of disease chronicity and medication. Cooper, Sagar, 
and Sullivan (1993) found that memory deficits were greater in chronically medicated 
patients, at least in the early stages. In remote memory, a specific dating impairment 
seems to be present despite a good recognition memory for the content of both public 
and autobiographical episodes (Friedman & Wilkins, 1985). 

480 
Henri Cohen 
33-2.3. Language Comprehension 
Impaired comprehension of verbal material is also a feature of the cognitive loss 
encountered by PD subjects. Comprehension in PD, although grossly intact, may be 
affected by frontal-lobe mediated attentional deficits. Grossman, Carvell, Stern, 
Gollomp, and Hurtig (1991) examined the ability of nondemented PD subjects to 
interpret grammatical aspects of sentences and found that impairment in some patients 
on tests of sentence comprehension was correlated with reduced mesial frontal lobe 
glucose metabolism (as measured by PET imaging), suggesting an association with 
frontal-lobe attentional mechanisms. In another PET study, Grossman et al. (1991) 
implicated the anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that a defect in this area contributes 
to the specific linguistic impairments the authors observed in PD. Grossman, Carvell, 
and Peltzer (1993) also observed a significant correlation between bilateral mesial 
frontal cortex and comprehension of sentences with center-embedded subordinate 
phrases. In another study, the authors found that a majority of PD patients were 
compromised in their ability to answer simple questions about sentences such as "The 
Eagle chased the hawk that was fast. Which bird was chased?" (Grossman, Carvell, 
Gollomp, et al., 1991). These impairments were greater when sentences increased in 
syntactic complexity. In general, it was found that sentence comprehension deficits 
were similar in PD and in frontal lobe insults. In a more recent study, nondemented 
PD subjects were exposed to a new verb and the grammatical and semantic infor- 
mation that they learned about the verb was probed. Grossman and colleagues ob- 
served that most of the PD subjects demonstrated a language-sensitivity deficit in 
appreciating the grammatical information and that a small number of patients re- 
sponded randomly to the probes. This difficulty in appreciating grammatical infor- 
mation may be, folkowing Grossman, Stern, & Gollomp, (1994), one of the factors 
implicated in the language impairments of PD patients. 
"Greek PD subjects were also tested for their competence to process relative 
clauses (that) in sentences without semantic constraints. Relative clauses, as a form 
of pronoun assignment, present a concise picture of syntactic, semantic, and prag- 
matic function at the level of sentence grammar. The findings showed a clear lan- 
guage deficit in PD (Natsopoulos, Katsarou et al., 1991). Additional evidence in the 
study also showed that PD patients' performance was similar to that of Grade 1 
children. The authors propose a "regression hypothesis" to explain their results; 
they also suggest that PD subjects processed sentences with complex semantic re- 
versibility on a heuristic and not on an algorithmic basis. Syntax comprehension has 
also been studied, using the Rhode Island Test of Language Structure, in PD with 
and without dementia (Lieberman et al., 1992). It was found that most demented 
PD patients had high comprehension error rates for sentences that had moderately 
complex syntax. In contrast, the error rates of the nondemented subjects were low 
and similar to those of control subjects. The authors propose, in line with other for- 
mulations to explain general cognitive deficits in PD, that destruction of the mid- 
brain regions that stimulate the frontal cortex may be responsible for these syntactic 
comprehension deficits. Pathology of the neostriatum has also been implicated in 

33 
Language Impairment in PD 
481 
disruption of syntactic organization in spontaneous language production (Illes, 
1989). 
Understanding of relational terms, such as before and after denoting succession, is 
impaired in PD patients relative to control subjects matched for age, sex, education, 
and socioeconomic status (Natsopoulos, Mentenopoulos et al., 1991). Data from the 
study further reveal that before is better understood than after, and that order of event 
mention may be a predominant language strategy in PD patients. Appreciation of mass 
and count quantifiers in PD appears also to be affected. Grossman et al. (1993), for 
example, found that patients often erred by pointing to the incorrect mass or count 
type of a substance and made more detecting errors in the agreement between a noun 
and a quantifying adjective. These deficits point to the multifactorial and complex 
nature of comprehension impairments in PD and suggest that PD patients have diffi- 
culty in the integration of surface structure information conveyed by syntax, semantics, 
pragmatics, and the interrelation of causal elements. 
Attention has recently been directed to more complex linguistic processes such as 
verbal reasoning. In a study by Cohen et al. (1994), results from a battery of tests 
including the similarities subtest of the WAIS, logical reasoning and invited inference 
were obtained from nondemented PD patients and education-matched controls. The 
invited inference test was made up of pairs of sentences such as "The boy is coming 
out of the kitchen; there is an empty glass on the counter. What do you think has 
occurred?" The verbal logical reasoning test (VLRT; Whitaker, Markovits, Savary, 
Grou, & Braun, 1991) was made up of logical problems of the form "Suppose it is 
true that: If p then q." For each problem, subjects had to choose between a nonlogical 
conclusion, a definite conclusion, or an uncertain conclusion that conformed to or was 
contrary to the premises. An example of such a problem is presented in Table 1. 
Significant impairments were revealed in the similarities test showing an inability, on 
the part of some patients, to generate more than one instance of similarity between 
the items in a pair. It is as yet unclear whether the poorer performance of PD subjects 
is due to underlying conceptual or flexibility difficulties, or confining one's responses 
to a restricted semantic field or representation; the results, however, can be interpreted 
in the context of a deficient ideational fluency (see also Wilson & Gilley, 1992). In

the VLRT, PD subjects more frequently selected conclusions that were contrary to the 
premises, a response probably attributed to a problem in the comprehension of syn- 
tactically complex material. There was no impairment in the invited inference test, 
suggesting that "common sense" appeared to be well preserved in that sample of PD 
subjects. 
33-3. CONCLUSION 
Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter point to specific language deficits in PD. 
They suggest that PD subjects have some difficulty with category fluency and more 
pronounced impairment with the temporal organization of verbal information, with 
learning and memory, and with the processing and comprehension of syntactic infor- 
mation. In addition, it was found that complex verbal reasoning deficits were also a 
feature of PD. 
It is tempting to conclude that neurolinguistic disorders are part and parcel of the 
Parkinsonian syndrome. It remains, however, to be confirmed whether disorders of the 
neostriatum or executive-type deficits cannot adequately (and more parsimoniously) 
explain the nature of the linguistic impairments observed in these studies. Parkinson's 
disease is considered by many to be a "frontal" disorder in which executive deficits 
occur and are important for understanding the clinical symptoms, mainly because of 
the extensive reciprocal connections between the basal ganglia with the prefrontal 
cortex and the limbic system. Indirect evidence points to the disruption of a fronto- 
striatal network following degradation of the dopaminergic (DA) projection system to 
explain the physiological basis of the linguistic deficits in PD. So far, it appears that 
simpler aspects of language processing are performed normally whereas PD patients 
experience difficulty in accessing the cognitive resources needed for the treatment of 
more complex linguistic information. Related issues are whether PD affects equally 
language and nonlinguistic functions, and whether the dementia in PD affects lin- 
guistic performance differently than the dementia in Alzheimer's disease (see also 
Bayles, 1993). 
Moreover, there is a need for more sophisticated statistical treatment of comparative 
data in investigations of linguistic performance in PD. It is often the case that uni- 
variate analyses of comparative data, between PD and adequately matched control 
subjects, fail to reveal significant differences between these groupsmalthough the per- 
formance of PD subjects is always lower. Trend analyses and appropriate evaluation 
of effects (see Bernstein, Garbin, & Teng, 1988) would most probably reveal mean- 
ingful differences that are not otherwise evident. A complementary procedure, which 
now appears necessary given the number of studies addressing the question of lin- 
guistic processing and impairment in PD, is the use of meta-analytical approaches to 
determine the extent and robustness of the trends and differences observed in the 
literature. 
Finally, side effects of drug treatment of parkinsonism on cognitive or linguistic 
function have seldom been taken into account (Taylor, Saint-Cyr, & Lang, 1987).

Language Impairment in PD 
483 
Pharmacological treatment of PD typically includes dopaminergic substances such as 
direct dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide) or dopamine reuptake inhib- 
itors (e.g., deprenyl). Anticholinergic agents are also often prescribed with older sub- 
jects (e.g., trihexyphenidyl). Although they have been extensively studied, the con- 
sequences of chronic PD medication on cognition are not well known. Data from 
recent studies, however, show that dopaminergic treatment (deprenyl excepted) may 
negatively affect cognitive performance in tasks that require important attentional re- 
sources such as memory and language (Malapanis, Pillon, Dubois, & Agid, 1994). 
With younger patients without cognitive deficits, minimal therapeutic doses of anti- 
cholinergic medication have been shown to induce a "frontal syndrome" for the du- 
ration of the treatment. Also, in large doses, these neuroleptic treatments may induce 
confusional states and, in older patients, may give rise to irreversible dementia (Dubois 
& Pillon, 1992; B6dard, Pillon, Dubois, Masson, & Agid [in press]). Almost none of 
the studies reported here have examined the impact of PD medication on cognitive 
performance. Future efforts should also carefully consider these treatment variables.

Communication and Language 
Disturbances Following 
Traumatic Brain Injury

School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia 
Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in aphasic disturbances in a minority 
and impaired communication competence in many more. Different assessment 
approaches have revealed problems in maintaining coherence across extended 
discourse, difficulties in the production and comprehension of conversational in- 
ference, and clumsy participation in conversation, including poor topic mainte- 
nance and failure to cater to the needs of a conversational partner. TBI produces 
cognitive impairments that vary in both severity and nature. The particular cog- 
nitive deficits experienced may have direct ramifications for impaired commu- 
nication. In particular, loss of attention, slowed information processing, and loss 
of executive control may underlie much of poor communicative ability in TBI. 
Traumatic brain injury, frequently incurred as a result of motor vehicle accidents, leads 
to diffuse, microscopic, axonal injury as well as multifocal damage throughout the 
cerebrum. Lesions are commonly concentrated in the temporal and medial-orbital 
zones of the frontal lobes due to rapid acceleration-deceleration forces during impact, 
crushing these areas against the bony fossas of the cranium in which they are cradled 
(Walsh, 1986). Recovery from severe TBI is variable but there is almost always some 
residual impairment as frequently psychosocial as sensorimotor (Tate, Lulham, 
Broe, Strettles, & Pfaff, 1989). Communication disturbances are common following

TBI and have been considered one of the major impediments to successful rehabili- 
tation in a patient group that is typically composed of young adults with a full life 
span ahead. This chapter will review the nature of these disturbances and some ap- 
proaches to their measurement, and then consider some explanations for them. 
Until fairly recently, descriptions of language impairment following TBI focused 
on aphasic symptomatology. The actual incidence of aphasia has been estimated from 
between 2% (1,544 cases: Arseni, Constantinovici, Iliescu, Dobrota, & Gagea, 1970; 
750 cases: Heilman, Safran, & Geschwind, 1971) to roughly 30% (125 patients: Sarno, 
1988), with anomic aphasia the most prevalent in adults (Heilman et al., 1971; Levin, 
Grossman, & Kelly, 1976; Thomsen, 1975) and nonfluent aphasias (Global and Broca- 
like) more prevalent in children and adolescents (Basso & Scarpa, 1990). For a pro- 
portion of these patients, such aphasic deficits resolve over the ensuing months 
(Grosswasser, Mendelson, Stern, Schecter, & Najenson, 1977; Thomsen, 1975, 1984) 
although few completely regain premorbid language abilities (Basso & Scarpa, 1990; 
Thomsen, 1984). Although not classified as aphasic, many other TBI patients perform 
lower than expectations on specific language subtests, for example, confrontation nam- 
ing, word finding, or verbal associative tasks, as well as structured tests of compre- 
hension such as the Token Test (Gruen, Frankle, & Schwartz, 1990; Levin et.al., 1976; 
Levin, Grossman, Rose, & Teasedale, 1979; Sarno, 1988). Opinion has differed as to 
whether such deficits reflect a "subclinical aphasia" not apparent in casual conver- 
sation (Sarno, 1988) or, as currently more widely accepted, attentional and memory 
disorders rather than linguistic impairment per se (Sohlberg & Mateer, 1989; Holland, 
1984). 
Although frank aphasic features in conversational speech are thus relatively un- 
common, profound communication difficulties are not. TBI patients have been found 
to have a range of difficulties in everyday communication that fall into several broad 
categories. First, they have been described as overtalkative (Hagan, 1984; Milton, 
Prutting, & Binder, 1984; Milton & Wertz, 1986) but inefficient (Hartley & Jensen, 
1992), drifting from topic to topic (Snow, Lambier, Parson, Mooney, Couch, & 
Russell, 1987) and making tangential and irrelevant comments (Prigatano, Roueche, 
& Fordyce, 1986). Alternatively, some patients are impoverished in the amount and 
variety of language produced (Chapman et al., 1992; Hartley & Jensen, 1991, 1992; 
Ehrlich, 1988), their conversational style characterized by slow, frequently incomplete 
responses, numerous pauses, and a reliance on set expressions (Thomsen, 1975). A 
third category of discourse characterized by confused, inaccurate, and confabulatory 
verbal behavior has also been advocated (Hartley & Jensen, 1992), and other com- 
binations of these features can occur in individual patients (Hartley & Jensen, 1992; 
McDonald, 1992a). 
Conventional approaches inadequately characterize the breadth and pervasiveness 
of these communication disorders as evidenced by a lack of correlation between 
aphasia language batteries and other measures of communicative competence 
(Hartley & Jensen, 1991; Liles, Coelho, Duffy, & Zalagens, 1989; McDonald & van 
Sommers, 1993). As an alternative, advances in linguistic theory have proven fruit- 
ful in capturing the nature of some of the problems faced by TBI patients and can 

34 
Traumatic Brain Injury and Language 
487 
be discussed under three headings: discourse analysis, pragmatic analysis, and con- 
versational analysis. 
34-1. DISCOURSE 
ANALYSIS 
Where conventional language tests analyze language at no greater complexity than 
the sentence, discourse analyses are concerned with the discourse as a whole, its 
continuity, semantic organization, and the relation between structure and function (see 
Patry & Nespoulous, 1990 for review). Discourse analysis in TBI has focused on 
monologues such as telling a story or relating a procedure and the resultant text has 
been analyzed to determine whether it meets certain functional requirements, in par- 
ticular, whether it is efficient and coherent. 
34-1.1. Efficiency 
Efficiency of discourse has been characterized as the rate of speech or amount of 
information imparted in the words produced. Adult and adolescent TBI patients have 
been found to speak more slowly (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; Wychoff, 1984), produce 
fewer meaningful words overall (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; Chapman et al., 1992; 
Wychoff, 1984), more incomplete or ambiguous utterances (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; 
Wychoff, 1984), as well as shorter informational units (C-units) (Hartley & Jensen, 
1991) and less information per minute (Ehrlich, 1988) across both narrative and pro- 
cedural discourse tasks. In some subjects, such findings may reflect the presence of 
motor speech problems (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; Wychoff, 1984), but not all subjects 
exhibiting decreased efficiency have dysarthria (e.g. Ehrlich, 1988). Alternatively, re- 
duced verbal retrieval as demonstrated on tests of fluency or naming may be associated 
with low productivity in some subjects (e.g. Levin, Grossman, Sarwar, & Meyers, 
1981), but again, this is not always the case (Hartley & Jensen, 1991). 
34-1.2. Coherence 
The coherence of discourse relies on the semantic continuity of the text (Patry & 
Nespoulous, 1990). Discourse may be coherent at a "local" level, that is, there are 
appropriate relations between adjacent propositions, or at a "global" or macrostructure 
level, that is, there is development and maintenance of an underlying discourse plan 
(Coelho, Liles, & Duffy, 1991c; Patry & Nespoulous, 1990). Both notions of coher- 
ence have been investigated in TBI subjects. 
34-1.2.1. Local Coherence 
One measure of local coherence is provided by an estimate of textual cohesion created 
by the interdependence of linguistic items occurring in separate clauses in a text. A co- 
hesive link occurs wherever one linguistic item relies on another for its interpretation, 

488 
Skye McDonald 
via reiteration of semantically linked items ("she picked up her shawl and put the 
wrap over her shoulder"), or grammatical links such as that formed via pronominal 
reference ("he had a plan of action but would not divulge it") (Halliday, 1985; 
Halliday & Hasan, 1985; Hasan, 1985). 
Because TBI discourse is frequently tangential and disorganized, it has been of 
interest to determine whether this reflects problems developing and maintaining textual 
cohesion. In support of this notion, some TBI subjects have been found to use less 
cohesive ties than non-brain-damaged control subjects (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; 
Mentis & Prutting, 1987; Wychoff, 1984), and in virtually all studies of cohesion, 
TBI subjects make more incomplete references where the source for interpretation of 
a given linguistic unit is missing or ambiguous (Hartley & Jensen, 1991; Liles et al., 
1989; McDonald, 1993b; Mentis & Prutting, 1987). Also, some TBI subjects appear 
to use certain types of cohesion differently from controls (Liles et al., 1989; Hartley 
& Jensen, 1991; McDonald, 1993b; Mentis & Prutting, 1987), although in general 
they remain sensitive to the demands of different discourse requirements, for example, 
procedural versus narrative discourse, varying the amount and type of lexicogram- 
matical cohesion accordingly, sometimes in a pattern similar to matched controls 
(Hartley & Jensen, 1991) and sometimes differently (Liles et al., 1989; Mentis & 
Prutting, 1987). 
Although cohesion analyses have thus yielded some consistent findings and also 
proven sensitive to changes in discourse function over time (Coelho et al., 1991b, 
1991c) there is also considerable variability between studies, including null findings 
(Jordan, Murdoch, & Buttsworth, 1991). This may reflect the fact that TBI subjects 
are not homogeneous with respect to communication impairments and will not, there- 
fore, demonstrate a uniform deficit in the maintenance of cohesive relations. Even so, 
further work is needed to improve the reliability and stability of the measures (Strong 
& Shaver, 1991) and to provide better characterization of cohesion patterns of normal 
speakers across tasks. In addition, the validity of cohesion measures requires explo- 
ration, given that two studies that attempted to match cohesion to subjective impres- 
sions of the coherence of the discourse yielded nonsignificant associations (Glosser & 
Deser, 1990; McDonald, 1993b). 
34-1.2.2. Global Coherence 
Global coherence has been gauged by identifying the nature and sequence of the 
propositional content, propositions being roughly equivalent to a predicate with one 
or more arguments (Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978; van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). In narrative 
tasks, the propositional structure of TBI discourse has been characterized using story 
grammar analysis, which focuses on the nature of the story constituents as well as 
their interrelationships within the story structure (Fayol & Lemaire, 1993). According 
to story grammar analysis, stories consist of key as well as optional story components 
(e.g., Chapman et al., 1992) organized appropriately, that is, into episodes defined as 
sequences of events with defined beginnings, middles, and ends (Chapman et al., 1992; 
Jordan et al., 1991; Liles et al., 1989). Using this approach, TBI adults reportedly 

34 
Traumatic Brain Injury and Language 
489 
produced as many complete episodes in a story retelling task as controls (Liles et al., 
1989), but fewer complete and more incomplete episodes on a story generation task 
(Liles et al., 1989; Coelho, Liles, & Duffy, 1995). In contrast, Chapman et al. 
(1992) reported that their adolescent TBI subjects produced less-complete episodes 
in a story retelling task and also less of the essential story elements. In another var- 
iation, Jordan et al. (1991) failed to find any differences between their TBI children 
and controls in the number of complete episodes produced in a story generation 
task. 
More consistent results have been yielded by investigating the propositional struc- 
ture of procedural discourse produced by nonaphasic TBI subjects with clinically 
defined communication problems (McDonald, 1993b; McDonald & Pearce, 1995; 
Turkstra, McDonald, & Kaufman, 1995). In each of these studies, the subject was 
asked to explain how to play a novel board game, "the dice game," to a naive listener. 
The explanations were then evaluated as to the number, type, and sequence of prop- 
ositions produced. In the first of these studies (McDonald 1993b), the procedural texts 
produced by two TBI subjects were also the subject of cohesion analysis (see the 
preceding section) and independent raters' evaluations. According to the propositional 
analysis, one subject provided fewer different propositions than the controls, while 
the other repeated more propositions. These features were consistent with raters' im- 
pressions that there were too few details and too much repetition, respectively. Fur- 
thermore, both subjects made discrete errors on sequencing, failing to present infor- 
mation in the same order of priority as the controls and focusing on irrelevant 
propositions at the beginning of their explanations. The independent ratings of the 
texts as both confusing and disorganized validated these sequence characteristics as 
genuinely disruptive. In subsequent studies it has been repeatedly demonstrated that 
TBI subjects, both adults and adolescents, omit essential information, provide a dis- 
rupted sequence of explanation, and include irrelevant and ambiguous material 
(McDonald & Pearce, 1995; Turkstra et al., 1995). 
34-2. PRAGMATIC 
ANALYSIS 
A second approach to clinical communication disorders has developed on the basis 
of pragmatic theory, which addresses the relationship between the surface structure 
of an utterance, the context in which it occurs, and the information imparted via 
inference (see Levinson, 1983 for review). Of particular interest is the notion that any 
given message may be communicated via a variety of surface forms. Choice of a par- 
ticular form will be guided by politeness or other cultural conventions (Brown & 
Levinson, 1987) and in many situations, such as advertising, will be made in order to 
communicate a number of messages simultaneously (Nippold, Cuyler, & Braunbeck- 
Price, 1988). Successful communication requires the ability to understand and 
use pragmatic inference, and pragmatic theory has emerged as a fruitful framework 
with which to discuss a variety of nonaphasic communication disorders, for example, 
those associated with right-hemisphere lesions (Molloy, Brownell, & Gardner, 1990; 

490 
Skye McDonald 
Stemmer, 1994; Stemmer, Giroux, & Joanette, 1994). Studies of TBI subjects have also 
benefited from this approach. 
34-2.1. Comprehension 
A number of studies have demonstrated impaired comprehension of pragmatic infer- 
ence in TBI subjects. TBI subjects selected on clinical grounds for their poor com- 
munication skills were found to be inferior to matched controls in their capacity to 
derive alternative meanings in ambiguous advertisements (e.g., "Fascinating things 
happen on 'Impulse,' .... Impulse" being a brand of deodorant) (Pearce, McDonald, 
& Coltheart, 1995), conventional indirect speech acts (e.g., "Can you pass the salt") 
(McDonald & van Sommers, 1993), or sarcastic remarks in which the intended mean- 
ing is the opposite of the literal meaning ("What a great football game") (McDonald, 
1992b; McDonald & Pearce, 1996). In each case they preferred the literal meaning, 
regardless of the context. 
34-2.2. Production 
TBI subjects also demonstrate differential impairment in their use of pragmatic strat- 
egies when making requests. A sample of such subjects have been shown to be sen- 
sitive to the relative politeness of different forms of simple requests and able to 
moderate the formality of requests in different contexts (McDonald & van Sommers, 
1993), and yet to be ineffective in the formulation of more complex requests designed 
to overcome listener reluctance (e.g., borrowing a car when the owner needs it herself) 
(McDonald & Pearce, in press). They produced less elaborate requests than controls 
that were unlikely to address the obstacle to listener compliance and more likely to 
encompass counterproductive comments that would discourage the listener from com- 
plying. It has also been demonstrated that TBI can compromise the ability to produce 
nonconventionally indirect requests, that is, hints, that allude to the request by infer- 
ence alone (McDonald & van Sommers, 1993). Similar deficits in comprehension and 
production have been found in adolescent TBI subjects (Dennis & Barnes, 1990; 
Turkstra et al., 1995; Wiig & Secord, 1989). 
34-3. CONVERSATIONAL 
ANALYSIS 
Conversational analysis focuses on how verbal interaction between two or more par- 
ticipants is managed during spontaneous conversation (Patry & Nespoulous, 1990), 
and in TBI research has incorporated a variety of behavioral and linguistic measures. 
Checklists and rating scales have been used that range in focus from global measures 
of verbal and nonverbal behavior, for example, "social performance" (Newton & 
Johnson, 1985; Spence, Godfrey, Knight, & Bishara, 1993) to measures of specific 
and discrete attributes of communication, for example, "frequency of questions" 
(Godfrey, Knight, Marsh, Moroney, & Bishara, 1989). Using these it has been re- 
peatedly demonstrated that severe TBI subjects have poor topic maintenance (Ehrlich 

34 
Traumatic Brain Injury and Language 
491 
& Barry, 1989; Milton, Prutting, & Binder, 1984; Snow et al., 1987), poor initiation 
(Ehrlich & Barry, 1989), are unskilled in their response to questions from their con- 
versational partner (Spence, Godfrey, Knight, & Bishara, 1993), egocentric in their 
discussion, fail to actively involve their conversational partner, for example by asking 
questions or supporting them with the use of verbal reinforcers (Marsh & Knight, 
1991a; Flanagan, McDonald, & Togher, 1995), and elicit high rates of facilitative 
behavior in their conversational partner when engaged in discussing a problem 
(Godfrey, Knight, & Bishara, 1991). 
Linguistic analyses of these kinds of conversational behaviors in TBI are only just 
emerging but tend to support the subjective impressions described earlier. For example, 
Mentis and Prutting (1991) segmented and classified spontaneous conversation as well 
as monologues in order to characterize topic maintenance. They reported that, relative 
to the non-brain-injured control subject, their TBI subject changed topic in an inco- 
herent manner without signaling his intention, made ambiguous statements due to a 
failure to establish clear reference, produced less novel information to develop a topic 
and more of this in response to specific questions. Coelho et al. (1991a) categorized 
utterances as to who initiated them, whether they were responded to, and the degree 
to which they were appropriate. TBI subjects, relative to controls, had more conver- 
sational turns, elicited more prompts from their partner, and differed in the perceived 
appropriateness of their conversation. Finally, conversational analysis has not only 
been directed toward uncovering the nature of impairments in the conversational skills 
of TBI subjects, but also the manner in which conversation is altered in reaction to 
these impairments. Compensatory strategies used by TBI subjects and their conver- 
sational partners have been identified and analyzed (Penn & Cleary, 1988), as well as 
the manner in which linguistic markers of social dominance alter in the conversational 
style of speakers talking to TBI versus normal adults (Togher, Hand, & Code, 1995). 
34-4. EXPLANATIONS 
FOR 
COMMUNICATION 
DISTURBANCES 
IN TBI 
Explanations for TBI communication disturbances need to be considered within the 
context of prevalent patterns of neuropathology and coexisting cognitive deficits. As 
mentioned in the introductory section, TBI commonly (but not universally) results in 
diffuse damage and multifocal lesions concentrated in the temporal and frontomedial 
lobes of the brain. Different constellations of language impairment are apparent in 
TBI (see the introductory section) and particular characteristics may reflect the specific 
effects of these lesions. Diffuse injury, associated with attentional problems, slowed 
information processing, and verbal retrieval difficulties (Lezak, 1995), has implications 
for communication efficiency and coherence. The finding that immediate memory span 
(Digits Forward, from the Wechsler Memory Scale) is associated with productivity 
measures (Hartley & Jensen, 1991) corroborates a role for attention in linguistic ef- 
ficiency, although, surprisingly, information-processing speed has not been found to 
be related (Godfrey et al., 1989). It has also been queried whether verbal retrieval 
deficits underlie reduced cohesion, in particular, underutilization of lexical cohesion 

492 
Skye McDonald 
(Mentis & Prutting, 1987), although an attempt to establish this empirically was un- 
successful (Hartley & Jensen, 1991). 
Frontal lobe injury, exacerbated by diffuse damage, leads to impairment of the 
executive control of other cognitive activity, resulting in inertia, perseveration, rigidity, 
stimulus-bound thinking and poor abstract thought, reduced problem-solving skills, a 
failure to plan ahead and/or monitor behavior in order to achieve a goal, and failure 
to inhibit inappropriate or unadaptive responses (Walsh, 1986; Lezak, 1995). Distur- 
bances in the control of cognition and behavior have obvious ramifications for the 
ability to engage in socially-effective verbal interaction. Furthermore, many of the 
characteristics of TBI communication skills bear a striking resemblance to descriptions 
of nonaphasic language impairment following focal lesions to the frontal lobes (for 
review, see Alexander, Benson, & Stuss, 1989; McDonald, 1993a). 1 
Work is just beginning, however, to link executive deficits to specific communi- 
cative disturbances. First, general problems of stimulus-bound behavior and poor ab- 
straction skills may result in inability to comprehend pragmatic inference. In support 
of this, TBI patients who were poor at understanding pragmatic inference in conven- 
tional and nonconventional indirect speech acts (indirect requests and sarcasm, re- 
spectively) were also poor on standard neuropsychological measures of concept for- 
mation (McDonald & van Sommers, 1993, McDonald & Pearce, in press-a), although 
not all efforts to find such correlations have proven successful (Turkstra et al., 1995). 
Within discourse analysis it has been speculated that patients who display differential 
reliance on lexical cohesion in storytelling have a pathological fixation with the con- 
crete, visible attributes of the stimuli used to generate stories (Liles et al., 1989). This 
interpretation is feasible but awaits empirical confirmation. 
Second, problems in the planning and monitoring of behavior may lead to difficulty 
adhering to conventional discourse macrostructure. For example, when relating a story, 
an association has been reported between the frequency of incomplete episodes and 
perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Coelho et al., 1995), sug- 
gesting that perseveration leads to a pathological failure to terminate episodes when 
developing the narrative. Similar problems in regulating behavior appear to influence 
procedural discourse performance. A TBI subject with predominantly impaired im- 
pulse control on neuropsychological testing produced a disorganized and tangential 
procedural explanation, while, conversely, a TBI subject suffering predominantly from 
inertia on formal tests was laborious and repetitive in the development of his discourse 
~Descriptions of TBI language disturbances also bear a close relationship to RH language 
(for comparison, see Fredriksen & Stemmer, 1993; Joanette & Goulet, 1990; Molloy, Brownell, & 
Gardner, 1990). There is no a priori reason to suspect differential RH impairment in TBI, but the 
two groups do appear related in terms of the type of cognitive deficit associated with the commu- 
nication disturbance. For example, in one of the few studies to relate neuropsychological measures 
to language performance, it was revealed that abilities traditionally attributed to the RH such as 
visuospatial skills bore little relation, while skills in planning, monitoring, and integrating were 
linked (Stemmer, Giroux, & Joanette, 1994). These latter abilities are often compromised in TBI, 
have typically been termed executive control, and attributed to the frontal lobes of the brain, left 
and right (Lezak, 1995). It may be that RH language impairment thus reflects executive impairment 
secondary to anterior or more generalized cognitive impairment. 

34 
Traumatic Brain Injury and Language 
493 
(McDonald, 1993b). Despite these qualitative similarities, the relationship between 
specific executive cognitive disorders and failure to achieve global coherence in pro- 
cedural tasks has not yet been established empirically (McDonald & Pearce, 1995). 
Third, disinhibition, another facet of executive impairment, has further ramifica- 
tions for the production of socially appropriate communication. TBI patients, who had 
difficulty producing nonconventional indirect speech acts, not only found the use of 
inference difficult, but were also unable to refrain from stating their true intention, 
thus failing in their attempt to be indirect (McDonald & van Sommers, 1993). Direct 
requests likewise suffered, but in this case, because the subjects failed to inhibit tan- 
gential remarks that were not conducive to listener compliance. In the latter study, 
such behaviors appeared to be associated with neuropsychological measures of dis- 
inhibition (McDonald & Pearce, in press). 
Finally, poor abstract reasoning, poor inferential skills, and poor planning and mon- 
itoring of verbal behavior are likely to impact upon the ability to converse in an 
interactive manner that is sensitive to the needs of a conversational partner. In one of 
the few attempts to relate conversational skills to neuropsychological deficits, it has 
been verified that poor performance on a verbal fluency task, taken as a measure of 
inflexibility, was positively correlated to broad ratings of social competence in spon- 
taneous conversation (Marsh & Knight, 1991b). Interestingly, numerous measures of 
new learning and memory were not correlated to estimates of social competence. Thus, 
even though memory impairments reflecting temporal lobe injury are as common 
following TBI as executive impairments (Tate, Fenelon, Manning, & Hunter, 1991), 
these do not appear to have a direct impact on social communication. 
In summary, although the likelihood that many communication disturbances after 
TBI are a manifestation of coexisting deficits in attention, information processing, and 
executive control is supported by the emergence of these few correlational studies, 
further work is required. The heuristic value of considering higher-level language 
disturbance in terms of coexisting cognitive impairment is also enhanced by advances 
in cognitive neuropsychological theory. In particular, executive control is being spec- 
ified in more precise terms, for example, as a supervisory attentional system to over- 
ride routine behavior (Shallice & Burgess, 1991), or as a weakening of associations 
between goals, environmental stimuli, and stored knowledge in working memory 
(Goldman-Rakic, 1987; Kimberg & Farah, 1993). This precision helps to generate 
hypotheses regarding the role of executive functions in producing smooth and effective 
discourse. For example, independent measures of working memory capacity (repetition 
from the Western Aphasia Battery, Digits Backward, Wechsler Memory Scale) have 
been associated with linguistic measures of cohesion in TBI (Hartley & Jensen, 1991). 
The achievement of cohesion in extended discourse, for example, by ensuring that 
pronominal references have a clear source, requires on-line processing and monitoring 
of verbal output, clearly a working memory task. The capacity to generate inferences 
from stories has also been associated with working memory performance in TBI pa- 
tients (Dennis & Barnes, 1990), and may represent an advance on the specification of 
how TBI impairs the ability to comprehend inferential links in language. Thus, con- 
tinued refinement of models of cognitive dysfunction in TBI provide an opportunity 
to facilitate understanding of the communication problems seen.

34-5. CONCLUSIONS 
In conclusion, recent advances in linguistic theory and methodology have been fruitful 
in delineating the nature of communication disturbance(s) experienced in particular 
TBI subjects. Although there has been some variability between studies using similar 
methods, there have also been some consistent findings, and in this chapter three 
approaches have been discussed. First, discourse analyses have revealed problems in 
maintenance of coherence from one utterance to the next, as well as problems in the 
ability to prioritize and sequence information according to knowledge of conventional 
discourse structure. Second, using pragmatic theory as a framework, it has been dem- 
onstrated that TBI can impair sensitivity to inference impeding comprehension and 
production of socially effective communication. Finally, conversational analysis has 
focused on spontaneous conversation, using a range of measures, from behavioral and 
linguistic theoretical backgrounds and demonstrated difficulty monitoring topic, taking 
into account the cooperative nature of conversation, and meeting the needs of a con- 
versational partner. TBI does not result in uniform cerebral pathology and, not un- 
expectedly, a number of difficulties in communication have been observed, which 
appear to fall into different profiles. However, attempts to discriminate subgroups of 
TBI communication disturbance on empirical grounds are only just emerging (e.g., 
Hartley & Jenson, 1992; McDonald, 1993b). Many studies discussed have focused on 
small groups or single cases in order to circumvent problems of heterogeneity. This 
is sensible within a given study, but it may also explain some of the variability of 
findings produced by different research groups using similar methods. Study of com- 
munication disorders in TBI would benefit from clearer criteria with which to classify 
subtypes of communicative difficulty, and this task is made more feasible by the 
advent of some of the research techniques reviewed here. Although there is inherent 
variability in the TBI population, some characteristics of communication difficulties 
are extremely frequent and are likely to reflect common functional consequences of 
the trauma. In particular, coexisting cognitive impairments such as attentional, infor- 
mation-processing, and executive disorders appear to have an important role in pro- 
ducing many of the disturbances in communication seen. Efforts to demonstrate such 
associations using specific neuropsychological measures and indices of discourse fail- 
ure have had limited success to date. This is not entirely unexpected because standard 
neuropsychological tests and discourse tasks differ substantially in the nature of scores 
yielded. Furthermore, it is entirely possible that particular manifestations of cognitive 
and executive dysfunction have differential impact on discourse versus other kinds of 
goal-directed tasks. Ongoing improvements in the sophistication of linguistic measures 
in TBI, along with advances in cognitive neuropsychological theory, should enable 
better specification of the impact of impaired cognitive functions on sustained and 
effective social communication in traumatic brain injury.

Language Abnormalities in Psychosis: 
Evidence for the Interaction between 
Cognitive and Linguistic Mechanisms

Medicine and the Norristown State Hospital Clinical Research Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19129 
Frameworks that organize language and communication research in psychosis 
are described and the two major patterns of language deficits emerging from 
current research are reviewed (complexity-related deficits in oral speech and poor 
lexical cohesion/unclear reference). An integrated cognitive/neurolinguistic ap- 
proach to language research in psychiatry is advocated. This approach argues 
that many linguistic acts have cognitive requirements and the way in which cog- 
nitive deficits interact with and disrupt linguistic processing needs to be specified 
through a cognitive/neurolinguistic model. 
Oddities of language and communication have always been hallmarks of major psy- 
chiatric disorders, playing key roles in their clinical picture and, in some cases, their 
diagnostic criteria. The term "disorganized speech" in the current DSM-IV (American 
Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria has been salient to definitions of schizophrenia 
going back to its original describers (Kraepelin, 1971/1919; Bleuler, 1911). "Pres- 
sured" or "expansive" speech and "flight of ideas" have always been crucial to the

definition of mania. In spite of this, language dysfunction is rarely listed as a "char- 
acterizing" deficit in neuropsychological reviews of these disorders (Randolph, 
Goldberg, & Weinberger, 1993; Gray, Feldon, Rawlins, Hemsley, & Smith, 1991). 
This does not reflect a lack of good empirical data, as many studies have shown that 
schizophrenia and other psychotic patients differ from normals on a host of language 
measures. Instead, it reflects a common view that these language problems are caused 
by something else, namely, a disturbance in underlying thought structure or content 
(i.e., a thought disorder) or a failure in cognitive processing (e.g., working memory, 
attention). 
I will briefly describe the two major research perspectives on language/communi- 
cation abnormalities in psychosis that continue to frame current language research in 
psychiatry. Next, I will describe two patterns of results that emerge from recent re- 
search in psychosis and describe the cognitive factors used to explain them. Finally, 
I will advocate an integrated cognitive/neurolinguistic approach to language research. 
This approach argues that most linguistic acts have cognitive requirements, and that 
although a class of automatic linguistic processes may exist and need to be specified, 
most often cognitive and linguistic processes interact in fundamental ways that are 
quite difficult, perhaps even artificial, to disentangle. Throughout I will emphasize the 
major psychoses (schizophrenia and mania) because the disruptions in language and 
communication are most striking for these disorders and most language-oriented stud- 
ies in psychiatry have had this focus. 
35-1. MAJOR RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES 
35-1.1. The Speech--"Thought"mDisorder of Schizophrenia 
and Mania 
Thought disorder in psychiatric disorders was originally described by Bleuler (1911). 
By the "Bleulerian" view, speech anomalies in schizophrenia patients were spurned 
by abnormal conceptual structures or associative processes directly related to the psy- 
chotic state (e.g, bizarre mental content, autistic thought, tangentiality, poverty of 
speech, non sequiturs, derailment, neologisms, and "word salads"). The thought dis- 
order of mania differed in that it involved more prominent flight of ideas and circum- 
stantial speech. By this view, the mechanics of phonology, syntax, and semantics, 
when examined in isolation, were intact in the psychoses and placed no constraints 
on speech or comprehension. 
Psychiatry, in an attempt to operationalize the "Bleulerian" position and despite 
evidence that thought and language are not isomorphic (see Rieber & Vetter, 
1994), developed the tradition of measuring thought disorder through verbal be- 
havior, that is, speech, making it impossible to empirically segregate true linguistic 
failures from disturbances in thought content or structure, or cognitive processes 

35 
Language and Psychosis 
497 
(e.g., The Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language, and Communication 
Disorders, TLC; Andreasen, 1982). 1 Research in the "Bleulerian" tradition has 
sought to determine if "thought disorder" symptoms reflected disturbances in the 
underlying structure (actual semantic linkages) or function (speed or spread of ac- 
tivation) of lexical networks. Most studies have failed to demonstrate the former, 
that is, schizophrenics are not more prone to unusual responses on word associa- 
tion tasks (Laffal, 1965; see Cohen, 1978). Recently, however, Aloia, Gourovitch, 
Weinberger, and Goldberg (1996) reported results implying abnormality in the 
structure of semantic networks of chronic schizophrenia patients. Applying multi- 
dimensional scaling techniques to category fluency data, they found that, compared 
to normals, patients were less likely to group exemplars into subordinate clusters 
and produced category exemplars that "did not follow any logical ordering in 
two-dimensional space" (p. 270). 
Maher's work (1972) reflected the "Bleulerian" position and investigated the func- 
tion of semantic networks. For instance, Manschreck, Maher, Celada, Schneyer, and 
Fernandez (1991) reported a higher ratio of objects to subjects in thought-disordered 
individuals (object chaining, i.e., listing objects at the end of a sentence) and attrib- 
uted this to an attentional deficit that promotes associative intrusions. Research us- 
ing lexical priming has built considerable evidence suggesting that schizophrenia 
thought intrusions and derailments in discourse arise from the hyperactive function- 
ing of semantic networks. For instance, Kwapil, Hegley, Chapman, and Chapman 
(1990) used a degraded-word recognition task and found increased semantic priming 
in schizophrenia patients compared to bipolars and normal controls. This effect has 
been delineated by Spitzer et al., (1994), who utilized both semantic and phonologic 
priming tasks. Spitzer et al. found more pronounced semantic priming in thought- 
disordered schizophrenia patients, and suggested that information spreads more 
quickly and farther through the semantic networks of these individuals. They also 
observed phonologic inhibition in normals (to permit unimpeded articulation), but not 
in thought-disordered patients. Spitzer et al. concluded that thought disorder was as- 
sociated with more highly activated semantic and more disinhibited phonemic net- 
works. Spitzer's work is an advance, specifying well the associational disturbance 
discussed by B leuler and Maher, but leaves unclear the exact type of psychotic speech 
such abnormal activation causes and how this abnormality interacts with normal lan- 
guage operations. 
1Note, the terms "thought-disordered" and "speech-disordered" are, unfortunately, used inter- 
changeably in the literature, reflecting the underlying assumption that the problem is one of disturbed 
thought manifested through abnormal speech. The term "formal thought disorder" has been used 
to identify structural failures in speech unique to schizophrenia (although there is no consensus on 
its definition; see Jampala, Taylor, & Abrams, 1989) and to distinguish it from both mania and the 
phenomena of disturbed thought content. Use of "psychotic speech disorder" has been advocated 
by some, and is the recommendation of this author, as it is the less presumptive term.

35-1.2. Schizophrenic or Manic Speech as Aphasia 
Kraepelin (1971/1919), so struck by the similarity with aphasia, used the term 
"schizophasia" to describe schizophrenic speech. Indeed, the at least superficial sim- 
ilarity of schizophrenic to fluent aphasic speech prompted many comparisons, with 
the hope that they could be understood by the same etiologic mechanism. The hy- 
pothesis of this perspective is that the speech disorder found in some psychotic patients 
constitutes a deficit in primary language mechanisms. Prominently representing this 
position, Chaika (1974, 1982) utilized taped interviews of a schizophrenia patient to 
identify characteristics that "suggest a disruption in the ability to apply those rules 
which organize linguistic elements, such as phonemes, words, and sentences, into 
corresponding meaningful structures, namely words, sentences, and discourse" (1974, 
p. 275). She suggested that schizophrenic speech represented an "intermittent apha- 
sia," distinct from disordered thought that correlated with acute psychotic states, and 
was more prominent in the nonmedicated (for criticism see Fromkin, 1975). 
Several empirical studies have distinguished schizophrenia from aphasia (Gerson, 
Benson, & Frazier, 1977). Faber et al., (1983) found that thought-disordered schizo- 
phrenia patients had better auditory comprehension and use of complex phrases and 
polysyllabic words than aphasics, but more private word usage. Faber et al. (1983) 
argued that no classic aphasia syndrome existed for schizophrenia despite sharing 
features with fluent aphasics (fluent/spontaneous speech, idiosyncratic word usage, 
paraphasic responses, empty speech, and so forth). Landre, Taylor, and Kearns (1992) 
found that speech-disordered schizophrenia patients and fluent aphasics were identical 
in language comprehension, single-word naming, repetition, and spontaneous speech 
(e.g., semantic paraphasias, unclear reference). Landre et al. also found that an index 
of general intelligence was strongly associated with language performance in the 
schizophrenia patients, leading the authors to attribute the problems to a general cog- 
nitive deficit. 
Methodological issues plague comparative work with aphasia. Seldom are lesion 
locations matched within the aphasic sample. Regarding psychosis, standardized di- 
agnostic procedures are not always used, and patients are often medicated and chron- 
ically institutionalized, making unclear the attribution of deficits to a primary 
speech/language disorder. There are many reasons to differentiate schizophrenia from 
aphasia. Psychodynamically oriented writers such as Sass (1992) have noted that the 
intermittent nature of schizophrenic speech indicates a dependence on social contexts 
such as stress, and perhaps a motivation to avoid focus on threatening material. Others 
have noted that the speech of psychotic patients does not show a recovery curve as 
aphasics do, and, unlike aphasia, appears resistant to speech therapy. Finally, no clear 
dissociations of language functions has been shown in psychotic speech, as might be 
expected if it was an aphasia (intact fluency with impaired comprehension). Many 
workers would accept Faber et al.'s (1983) conclusion that similarities with aphasia 
exist, yet few would argue that psychosis brings with it an aphasic disorder. Interest- 
ingly, even those that liken schizophrenia to aphasia, such as Chaika, consider the 
etiologic mechanisms of it and aphasia to be different.

IN LANGUAGE/ 
COMMUNICATION 
RESEARCH 
35-2.1. Evidence for Complexity-Related Deficits in Oral Speech 
Several studies have noted lower syntactic complexity in schizophrenic speech and 
suggested that more basic linguistic processes are intact (Fraser, King, Thomas, & 
Kendell, 1986; Morice & McNicol, 1986). Morice and Ingram (1982) found that 
complexity properties (frequency and depth of embedded clauses), fluency (pause- 
fillers, false starts, repeats), and integrity of speech (syntactic, semantic errors) distin- 
guished schizophrenia, mania patients, and normal controls. Later, Morice and 
McNicol (1986) compared manic and schizophrenic speech and found that the latter 
used shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses, more word repeating, fewer 
reduced relative clauses (elision), and more semantic deviancy. These authors also 
reported that as syntactic complexity increased, so did semantic deviance. Morice and 
McNicol held that basic receptive and expressive language functions such as naming, 
repetition, and simple syntax were intact in schizophrenia, but that deficits were pres- 
ent at larger, more complex units (i.e., the level of organizing sequential, coherent 
discourse). They concluded that schizophrenic speech is less syntactically complex 
than that of manics and healthy controls, although its stability and relation to clinical 
state or general cognitive deficits remain unclear. 
Hoffman, Hogben, Smith, and Calhoun (1985) compared schizophrenia patients 
and controls using written output and found that errors were particularly frequent in 
representing input propositions when these propositions were written in the more com- 
plex passive voice. Later studies by Thomas, King, Fraser, and Kendall (1990; also 
King, Fraser, Thomas, & Kendell, 1990) found that chronic schizophrenia patients 
were more impaired on complexity measures (e.g., length of utterance, number of 
embedded clauses, levels of clause embedding) than acute patients and normal con- 
trols, and suggested that these problems were associated with negative symptoms, 
worsened with chronicity, but were unrelated to medication, institutionalization, or 
acute state. Recent work by Goldfarb, Stocker, Eisenson, and DeSanti (1994) used 
measures of communicative responsibility (production of comprehensible, usable 
speech) and found that schizophrenia patients had trouble generating a story in re- 
sponse to a picture (producing more irrelevant responses), whereas aphasics had trou- 
ble specifying the semantic features of a picture due to the naming demands. However, 
they found no differences between the groups at smaller, less complex units of lin- 
guistic analysis (e.g., specifying object properties or antonyms). 
This complexity finding is not without challenges. Some research has suggested 
that not all basic functions (e.g., fluency, naming, comprehension, repetition) are intact 
in schizophrenia. Barr, Bilder, Goldberg, Kaplan, and Mukherjee (1989) found that 
semantic paraphasias during confrontation naming were a common error in their 
sample of chronic schizophrenics. Seidman, Cassens, Kremens, and Pepple (1992) 
reported poor sentence repetition in thought-disordered schizophrenia. Kolb and 
Whishaw (1983) observed poor oral word fluency. Anand, Wales, Jackson, and 

500 
Joseph I. Tracy 
Copolov (1994) studied syntax, semantics, cohesion, and metaphor in an early psycho- 
sis sample and found that semantic comprehension best discriminated their psychotic 
patients from controls. A study by Thomas, Leudar, Newby, and Johnston (1993) using 
a writing-output paradigm found that schizophrenia and mania patients' written prod- 
ucts were equal in syntactic complexity (sentence length, subordinate clauses) to nor- 
mal controls. This finding suggested a dissociation between oral and written speech, 
and thus looms important for future efforts at determining whether the "complexity" 
finding in psychotic speech is based on a general problem of competence. 
Problematic is that some aphasics (Miyake, Carpenter, & Just, 1994) and other 
neurologic groups (right hemisphere and frontal lobe patients: Gordon, 1980; Lezak, 
1995) also have difficulty processing complex linguistic input and giving complex 
output. Thus, it is unlikely that these deficits in complex linguistic processing are 
unique to psychosis. 
35-2.2. Evidence for Poor Lexical Cohesion and Unclear Reference 
Perhaps the most widely reported flaws in the speech of psychotic patients, not highly 
indicative of aphasic speakers, are poor cohesion between discourse elements and 
unclear reference for pronouns, phrases, and clauses. Because of these failures, the 
speech of these patients becomes more and more incomprehensible to the listener as 
it becomes more distant from initial referents and context. 
Rochester and Martin's seminal study (1979) utilized interviews of thought-disor- 
dered and non-thought-disordered schizophrenia patients and established two widely 
cited aspects of discourse failure that distinguished the groups: (a) reliance on lexical 
or prosodic features to achieve cohesion between clauses, sentences, or prior context, 
and (b) poor introduction of nonshared, new information (i.e., unclear references for 
nominal groups, "predicative speech"). Harvey (1983; also Harvey & Serper, 1990) 
studied coherence and reference failures and showed that these failures are specific to 
the speech termed thought-disordered. Harvey (1983) found that the speech of 
thought-disordered patients, regardless of diagnosis, was more poorly integrated with 
fewer, less effective cohesion strategies and more incompetent references than both 
non-thought-disordered patients and controls. He also demonstrated that reference fail- 
ures occurred in children of acute patients as well as in remitted patients, suggesting 
that such failures were not due to acute state. More recently, Harvey and Serper 
(1990), using auditory distraction, reality monitoring, and word-span/encoding tasks, 
found that incompetent reference was less severe in mania than in schizophrenia, and 
that in schizophrenia it was predicted by distractibility and poor reality monitoring. 
Ragin and Oltmanns (1986) analyzed lexical cohesion while controlling for verbosity 
and found that schizophrenia patients produced fewer within-clause lexical cohesion 
devices than manics, and that for manics this measure improved with treatment. More 
recently, Docherty, Sledge, and Wexler (1994) studied linguistic references in schizo- 
phrenia outpatients and their families during discussion of negative and positive mem- 
ories. They found that reference performance deteriorated under the negative memo- 
ries condition and that poor reference performance in parents predicted both 

35 
Language and Psychosis 
501 
performance and positive symptoms in their patient offspring. Importantly, both 
Harvey's and Docherty's data raise the possibility that reference failure represents a 
genetic vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. 
The specificity of reference and cohesion failures to schizophrenia is uncertain, 
however, as mania patients appear to have similar difficulties (Miklowitz et al., 1991). 
For instance, Hoffman, Stopek, and Andreasen (1986) used discourse analysis (counts 
of phrase units in a semantic hierarchy that capture the truth suppositions of prior 
statements) to study the hypothesis that speech in schizophrenia and in mania both 
reflect cohesion problems but arise from different mechanisms. They found that mania 
patients used complex and well-organized plans but inappropriately shifted from one 
discourse plan to another ("structural shifts," i.e., a shift in topic), yet produced intact 
links between propositions in terms of logic and presupposition. Schizophrenia pa- 
tients, in contrast, showed a deficiency in forming plans ("structural deficiency," 
i.e., poorly organized propositions within one topic). Hoffman et al. (1986) also 
found that a subgroup of "manic-like" schizophrenia patients with accelerated 
speech, and so forth, were quite similar in discourse to mania patients, suggesting 
that symptomatology, not diagnosis, best related to the linguistic process (see Taylor, 
Reed, & Berenbaum, 1994 for further comparison of the speech of schizophrenia and 
mania patients). 
Based on the above, it is clear that providing unclear referents and poor cohesion 
are major findings for both schizophrenia and mania; however, several issues remain 
unsettled: the role of neuroleptic medication, chronicity, heterogeneity of the disorders, 
and the power of specific symptoms versus diagnosis to predict the speech disturbance. 
Some studies have identified a positive impact for medication on cohesion problems. 
For instance, Clark, Harvey, and Alpert (1994) found that medicated schizophrenia 
patients produced a greater number of clear references, and fewer episodes of bizarre, 
"interruptive" speech than nonmedicated patients. Also, chronicity may be a factor 
as syntactic and cohesion deficits appear most common in well-established schizo- 
phrenia (Morice & Ingram, 1982; Hoffman & Sledge, 1988; King et al., 1990). Again, 
the specificity problem exists as aphasic patients have also been reported to have diffi- 
culty reactivating antecedents, although perhaps for different reasons (Swinney, Zurif, 
Prather, & Love, 1994). Regarding the etiology of cohesion and reference failures, many 
of these researchers lean toward a cognitively oriented explanation, with the implication 
that the linguistic failures, while very real, are not the primary problem. 
35-3. COGNITIVE 
EXPLANATIONS 
OF LANGUAGE/ 
COMMUNICATION 
ABNORMALITIES 
Theorists who held that abnormal language was a mirror of disordered thought utilized 
broad cognitive explanations in hopes of explaining not just disturbed thought but 
other schizophrenic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions (see Maher, 1972). 
Recent explanations of abnormal speech in psychosis have provided more specific 

502 
Joseph I. Tracy 
cognitive models, drawn clearer links to specific linguistic failures, and, in some cases, 
proposed underlying biological substrates. Three cognitive functions have been im- 
plicated, and, generally, the dysfunction is viewed as disrupting both expressive and 
receptive language. The first posits a dysfunction in an attentional filtering mecha- 
nism. Schwartz (1982) held that schizophrenia and mania patients displayed a 
flawed filtering mechanism (pigeonholing) such that messages cannot be distin- 
guished (and behavior cannot be guided) on the basis of prior knowledge (response 
sets), but only on the basis of immediately available, salient stimulus features as re- 
flected in the tendency to repeat recently heard words, respond to strong, not weak, 
word meanings, and produce phonetic "clang" responses. As schizophrenia patients 
can discriminate phonemes, recognize and form words, and so forth, Schwartz con- 
cluded that there is adequate processing and filtering of basic linguistic features, and 
thus, schizophrenia is a cognitively based disorder of "speech" not "language" 
competence. 
The second cognitive function implicated involves a failure to hold information 
over the short term and keep it available for manipulation during speech or compre- 
hension, that is, a working memory failure. For instance, Harvey and Serper (1990) 
argued for a combined distractibility and short-term memory explanation of abnor- 
malities such as unclear reference, suggesting that the "inability to discriminate the 
origin of information in short-term memory could lead to a situation in which dis- 
course plans are confused for prior discourse, causing communication problems by 
leading to speech that refers to information never presented, only planned" (p. 492). 
The link between specific linguistic performance and working memory was well de- 
scribed by Thomas et al. (1993) in their analysis of written speech. They found that 
schizophrenia patients left out more propositions as syntactic complexity increased, 
and these errors correlated with working memory. Thomas suggested that working 
memory deficits placed limitations on the ability to organize and keep accessible all 
the input propositions needed for production of a final syntactic framework. Docherty, 
Hawkins, et al., (1996) found that reference performance was related to measures of 
working memory and sustained attention in nonacute schizophrenia patients, but re- 
lated to concept formation and verbal fluency in nonacute bipolar patients. Another 
study from this group suggested that both manic and schizophrenic inpatients produced 
much higher frequencies of reference failures than normal controls, with indications 
that manics and schizophrenia patients show similar reference failures though to var- 
ying degrees (Docherty, DeRosa, & Andreasen, 1996). Finally, a study by Niznikiew- 
icz et al. (1996) provided a good demonstration of the role that deficient working 
memory may play in certain linguistic findings. Schizophrenia patients showed an 
increase in N400 amplitude to "congruent" words at the end of a sentence (in normals 
this appears only for "incongruent" words), suggesting that patients were not using 
context to constrain associations to oncoming words. 
The third cognitive dysfunction that has been proposed emphasizes a failure in 
planning or self-monitoring (executive functions). Morice (1986) suggested that pre- 
frontal-based executive deficits underlie the reductions in syntactic complexity he had 

35 
Language and Psychosis 
503 
observed in prior studies. Barr et al. (1989) concluded that schizophrenia expres- 
sive deficits, particularly in object naming, are secondary to executive function/ 
prefrontal-based deficits in self-monitoring, planning, and perseveration. Hoffman 
(1986) proposed a breakdown in the voluntary control of language, whereby schizo- 
phrenia patients fail to maintain a discourse plan. Specifically, he suggested that at 
the level of syntactic discourse potential structures strongly compete in schizophrenia 
but not in normals. Thus, plans unintentionally generated during unconscious thought, 
which are inconsistent with conscious goals, can intrude into ongoing speech or be 
misattributed as having an external source (hallucinations). Finally, a theory of flawed 
monitoring and planning with clear neuroanatomical foci was offered by Crosson and 
Hughes (1987). They noted that thalamic lesions in normals can result in a fluent 
aphasia that presents as a formal thought disorder (paraphasia, empty speech, poor 
turn taking). They suggest that a medial thalamic-basal ganglia-prefrontal cortex net- 
work that mediates language monitoring is disrupted in schizophrenia, producing com- 
promised semantic accuracy in the context of intact motor aspects of speech. 
35-4. AN INTEGRATED 
COGNITIVE/ 
NEUROLINGUISTIC 
APPROACH 
Although cognitive explanations of communication breakdowns in psychosis may be 
fruitful and even correct, unclear reference, poor cohesion, and other language prob- 
lems, for example, neologisms, still need to be explained at a linguistic level; that is, 
even if schizophrenia cognitive deficits do cause linguistic failures, the way in which 
the cognitive deficits interact with and disrupt linguistic processing still needs to be 
specified through a cognitive/neurolinguistic model. All but the most automatic of 
linguistic acts depend on the highly integrated functioning of multiple cognitive (e.g., 
attention, memory) and linguistic (e.g., lexical, semantic, phonologic, syntactic, prag- 
matic) systems that occur under social demands. For instance, selective attention may 
be needed to parse heard sentences, working memory to comprehend extended text, 
and executive functions to plan, organize, and monitor speech output consistent with 
social communication requirements. The empirical studies cited in the preceding sec- 
tion showing that linguistic performance covaries with extent or type of cognitive 
deficit (see Docherty, Hawkins et al., 1996) highlight the possibility that psychosis is 
an instance where cognitive and linguistic mechanisms interact. 
Tracy, Glosser, and DellaPietra (1996) utilized the single-word retrieval model of 
Goodglass (1993) to identify the specific breakdown in linguistic processes that could 
account for a subset of naming errors in schizophrenia and integrated this with the 
well-established cognitive deficits in schizophrenia to show how the breakdown likely 
occurred. They reported two patients who produced combined phonemic/semantic er- 
rors on the Boston Naming Test, that is, responses containing correct phonological 
elements and a semantic relation to the target (e.g., re-recorate for wreath). In Good- 
glass's model the "interactive" track relies on monitoring (e.g., evaluating phonologic 

504 
Joseph I. Tracy 
precursors, organizing output), selecting (e.g., selecting among early, undifferentiated 
semantic associates), filtering (e.g., deleting off-target phonemic or semantic inputs), 
and attentional switching (moving focus between phonemic and semantic tracks). This 
model permitted specification of where in the process of word retrieval (the "inter- 
active track") schizophrenia deficits in monitoring, selecting, filtering, and switching 
might exert their disruptive effects. This preliminary work provides an example of 
the way cognitive and linguistic mechanisms might be integrated to explain specific 
speech abnormalities in psychiatry. 
35-5. FUTURE 
OUTLOOK 
Psychosis is a clinical phenomenon in which both cognitive dysfunction and disor- 
dered speech are evident. It may be a particularly fertile ground to study ways in 
which cognitive and linguistic mechanisms could interact to produce flawed language 
and communication. Studies that combine measures of cognitive processes, linguistic 
mechanisms, and psychotic speech should prove most useful. Toward this end, two 
research approaches can be united. First, attempts to dissociate cognitive (e.g., atten- 
tion resource limitations) and linguistic factors (e.g., syntactic processing) are common 
now in the aphasia literature (Martin, 1995; Swinney, Zurif, Prather, & Love, 1996). 
It is through such precise decoupling of linguistic and cognitive factors that we will 
be able to identify whether certain linguistic processes are truly automatic (require no 
cognitive resources) or the product of a cognitive/linguistic interaction. As measures 
highly sensitive to linguistic processing make their way into language studies of psy- 
chosis (e.g., the "P600" event-related potential response to syntactic anomalies; the 
"N400" response to sentential semantic anomalies--Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992; 
Osterhout, 1994), it will be possible to determine if psychotic patients display normal 
brain responses to linguistic stimuli and whether such responses vary as a function of 
cognitive load. Second, attempts to link specific linguistic failures to specific types of 
psychotic speech are emerging (see Anand & Wales, 1996, for discussion). Along this 
line, Barch and Berenbaum (1996) demonstrated several language production/ 
communication disorder associations (e.g., monitoring speech related to derailment, 
non sequiturs). 
Further testament that psychosis may be productive ground for studying the way 
cognitive and linguistic mechanisms interact is the observation that the morphologic 
regions implicated in schizophreniamleft frontal, left temporolimbic, basal ganglia, 
and thalamic structuresmare also known to be involved in both language and cognitive 
processing (Roberts, 1991). For instance, the anterior frontal region considered im- 
portant for word generation and sequencing (Nobre & McCarthy, 1995; Petersen, Fox, 
Posner, Mintun, & Raichle, 1988) has also been implicated in some of the cognitive 
deficits of schizophrenia (Weinberger, 1987). Basal ganglia and thalamic dysfunction 
have been implicated in schizophrenia (Gray et al., 1991; Andreasen et al. 1994), are 
considered important in attention (Posner & Petersen, 1990), and the left basal ganglia 
and left thalamus are integral parts of the subcortical, "habit learning" route con-

necting language-concept mediation areas of the occipitotemporal axis to anterior 
speech motor areas (Damasio & Damasio, 1992). Research on the overlap in the 
pathophysiology of schizophrenia, cognitive, and language disorders is in its infancy 
and constitutes an important area of inquiry. Unfortunately, we do not yet have models 
to explain how such shared anatomic substrates might, under certain conditions, trans- 
late into the flawed cognitive, linguistic, and symptomatic processes that we observe 
in psychosis. 
Regarding language/communication abnormalities in psychosis, a host of questions 
remain: (a) Are they limited to certain subgroups of patients? (b) Do environmental 
events trigger them (e.g., negative affect; Docherty, Evans, Sledge, Seibyl, & Krystal, 
1994)? (c) Are problems limited to acute exacerbations of the illness? (d) Are they 
mediated by the same neurochemical or neuroanatomical substrates that subserve cog- 
nitive deficits or psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations? (e) Are they influenced 
by psychotropic medication, chronicity, or institutionalization? (f) Do they imply 
abnormal language acquisition and support the possibility that some psychoses, that 
is, schizophrenia, are a developmental disorder? (g) Do they imply abnormal brain 
activation patterns during language processing? The role of medication is important 
as contrary reports emerge. Some data suggest that enhanced priming effects in 
schizophrenia are tied to antipsychotic medication (Barch et al., 1995). Others argue 
that antipsychotics most likely reduce language production disturbances (Barch & 
Berenbaum, 1996), and that medication and other factors (e.g., chronicity) are not 
key factors in language disturbances such as complexity deficits (King et al., 1990). 
Disorder subtypes may be important as some suggest that semantic priming effects 
are less reliable in paranoid schizophrenics compared to nonparanoids (Ober, Shenaut, 
& Vinogradov, 1995). Also, other patient characteristics may affect linguistic proc- 
essing (e.g., cognitive deterioration). Factors such as medication, chronicity, and pa- 
tient subtyping usually work as confounds to research findings, but need not if they 
are properly built into experimental designs. 
In the case of psychiatric disorders, brain abnormality is inferred from the presence 
of impaired and quite multidetermined behavior; in aphasia, the job is different, char- 
acterizing the behavioral deficits of known brain lesions. Language research in psy- 
chiatry can take advantage of its multidetermined nature and less clear grounding in 
brain-behavior relations by recognizing that psychoses may provide naturalistic ex- 
amples of how an abnormality arises from the interaction between multiple brain 
systems (linguistic, cognitive, and psychotic mechanisms). Such an interactionist per- 
spective will allow us to move beyond dichotomies regarding language and thought, 
and debates about the primacy of linguistic versus cognitive impairment. Such a per- 
spective will also be crucial for mapping out the complex neuroanatomy and neuro- 
chemistry that drive the abnormal speech and language seen in the psychoses.

CHAPTER 36 
Landau-Kleffner Syndrome 
Clinical and Linguistic Aspects 
Gianfranco Denes 
Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy 
Clinical neuropsychological and linguistic aspects of the Landau-Kleffner syn- 
drome (LKS, acquired childhood epileptic aphasia) are reviewed. Unlike child 
aphasia following focal lesions, LKS is characterized by severe auditory compre- 
hension disorders and by a strong relationship between age of onset and outcome: 
the older the child at onset, the better the outcome. 
Alternative hypotheses underlying comprehension disorders (purely linguistic 
versus sensory higher-order auditory processing deficit) are discussed. 
A specific impairment of language development can occur in two forms: a deficient 
acquisition, usually named Developmental Dysphasia (D.D.), or a loss of previously 
acquired language skills, Acquired Aphasia (A.A.) (Van Hout, 1992). 
Among the latter, of particular importance both in terms of frequency (more than 
160 cases reported from 1957 to 1990; Paquier, Van Dongen, & Loonen, 1992) and 
severity, is the symptom complex of "acquired aphasia and convulsive disorders," 
first described by Landau and Kleffner in 1957 (Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, LKS).

The lack of structural abnormalities, the prevalence of auditory comprehension defi- 
cits, and the poor outcome, often leading to a permanent loss of language production 
and comprehension, differentiate LKS from other forms of child aphasia following 
focal lesion (Van Hout, 1992). 
The aim of this chapter is to briefly describe the clinical characteristics, to review 
the linguistic deficits, and to speculate on the nature of the underlying auditory com- 
prehension deficit, if primarily linguistic or secondary to an impairment of a sensory/ 
cognitive mechanism necessary for language development and use. 
36-1. CLINICAL 
PICTURE 
LKS occurs in children who achieved developmental milestones at an appropriate age. 
The onset varies from 18 months to late infancy (Bishop, 1985; Paquier et al., 1992; 
Gerard, Dugas, Valdois, Franc, & Lecendraux, 1993), with the peak incidence between 
2 and 5 years, affecting subjects of both genders who had already developed age- 
appropriate speech. Exceptionally, LKS is seen in subjects with a history of devel- 
opmental language disorder (Marien, Saerens, Verslegers, Borggreve, & De Deyn, 
1993). 
Etiologies such as neurocysticercosis (Otero, Cordova, Diaz, Garcia-Teruel, & Del 
Brutto, 
1989), cerebral arteritis (Pascual-Castroviejo, Lopez-Martin, Martinez- 
Bermejo, & Perez-Higueras, 1992), and inflammatory demyelinating disease (Perniola 
et al., 1993) have been discussed in some cases, but so far they have not been con- 
firmed in the majority of cases. 
The onset may be subacute or "stuttering" and the first clinical manifestation of 
the language disturbance is an auditory inattention to both verbal and nonverbal stim- 
uli. The symptom may progress up to a pattern of cortical or word deafness (verbal 
auditory agnosia, VAA; Rapin, Mattis, Rowan, & Golden, 1977). At the same time, 
expressive language deteriorates with the appearance of phonological paraphasias and 
articulatory disorders. Eventually, the child may become completely mute, expressing 
himself or herself through unarticulated sounds or by the use of appropriate gestures. 
Rarely, fluent aphasia (Lerman, Lerman-Sagie, & Kivity, 1991) and jargon have been 
observed (Landau & Kleffner, 1957; Rapin et al., 1977; Paetau et al., 1991). 
The second landmark of the syndrome is epilepsy, present in more than 80% of 
the cases (Dugas, Masson, Le Henzey, & R6gnier, 1982; Beaumanoir, 1985). The 
seizures are heterogeneous in both their manifestations and their frequency. General- 
ized seizures are of the motor type and consist of eye blinking or brief ocular devi- 
ations. 
In contrast to the language impairment, seizures have a benign course, are respon- 
sive to common antiepileptic standard treatment, and, by the age of adolescence, 
generally subside (Mantovani & Landau, 1980). 
The spectrum of EEG abnormalities reported in LKS may vary. The most common 
abnormality is represented by bilateral independent or synchronous temporal or tem- 
poroparietal spikes, bilateral 1-to-3-Hz spike and wave activity centered over temporal 

36

Syndrome

regions or generalized sharp waves. An EEG abnormality recorded during slow-wave 
stages of sleep and consisting of continuous spikes and waves (Electrical Status Epi- 
lepticus, ESES) has been described in a number of LKS patients (Patry, Lyagoubi, & 
Tassinari, 1971; Tassinari, Bureau, Dravet, Dalla Bernardina, & Roger, 1985) and 
related to the severity of their language impairment (see Figure 1). 
EEG recordings taken at the earliest stages of illness, or waking recordings at any 
stage can show the presence of unilateral, focal, posterior-temporal discharges. 
Neurological examination, pure tone audiograms, CSF examination, and neuroim- 
aging studies (CT scan and MRI) are within normal limits. In the few metabolic studies

TABLE 1 
Landau-Kleffner Syndrome: Summary of the Clinical Findings 
1. Subacute (or sometimes stuttering) onset of progressive comprehension and production language 
disorders in a 2-5-year-old normal child who has already developed age-appropriate language 
competence. 
2. Predominance of auditory comprehension disorders, including auditory agnosia in the initial phase. 
3. Absence of psychotic traits and neuropsychological evidence of preservation of nonverbal cognitive 
abilities. 
4. Mild to pronounced behavioral abnormalities (hyperactivity, aggressiveness, depression). 
5. Absence of associated neurological signs. Normality of neuroimaging study (CT scan, MRI, cerebral 
angiography). 
6. Clinical seizures usually but not invariably present. Heterogeneous in character, often subtle and 
involving only eye movements. Good response to anticonvulsant drugs. 
7. Unilateral or bilateral independent, temporal or temporoparietal foci, bilateral spikes and waves 
activity. Continuous spikes and waves activity during slow sleep (ESES). 
Note: From Morrell et al., 1995, modified. 
performed (SPECT and PET), a reduced brain glucose utilization, as well as an asym- 
metrical hypoperfusion predominantly over the temporal lobes, were found (Maquet 
et al., 1990). 
The language impairment cannot be regarded as the most evident symptom of a 
generalized cognitive deficit, since nonverbal abilities such as memory, orientation, 
and praxis are well within normal limits. Only Papagno and Basso (1993) described 
a persistent mathematical impairment well after the resolution of aphasic symptoma- 
tology. 
The presence of psychotic traits is exceptional (Dugas et al., 1982; Gordon, 1990; 
Hirsch et al., 1990; Zivi, Broussaud, Daymas, Hazard, & Sicard, 1990), while behav- 
ioral disorders ranging in severity from mild to pronounced and characterized by 
hyperactivity, sometimes coupled with aggressive traits, are often reported (White & 
Sreenivasan, 1987; Sawhney, Suresh, Dhand, & Chopra, 1988). 
Table 1 summarizes the usual clinical findings. 
36-2. PROGNOSIS AND TREATMENT 
Although epileptic seizures have a benign course, generally subsiding at the time of 
adolescence, the case is unfortunately different as far as the language deficit is con- 
cerned: the rate of recovery is, in most cases, poor, sometimes characterized by re- 
missions and exacerbations that parallel the EEG course. 
Corticosteroid treatment has been found to have a beneficial effect on language 
disorders with a concomitant disappearance of EEG abnormalities; this effect is, how- 
ever, transient, with recurrence of electrical abnormalities and language disturbances 
when the drug is tapered off (Marescaux et al., 1990). 

36 
Landau-Kleffner Syndrome 
511 
A dramatic improvement of language function up to a total reacquisition of lan- 
guage after 2 years of mutism was reported by Morrell et al. (1995) in a subset of 
LKS children, following the surgical elimination of the epileptogenic discharge from 
the perisylvian region of one hemisphere by multiple subpial intracortical resections. 
A close relation was found by several authors (Toso, Moschini, Cagnini, & Antoni, 
1981; Dulac, Billard, & Arthuis, 1983) between age at onset and linguistic accom- 
plishment: the younger the child, the poorer the outlook. In a metanalysis of the 
published cases, Bishop (1985) extended and confirmed the conclusions of previous 
authors and attempted an intepretation of this age-related clinical course: If, as sug- 
gested by different sources (see Section 36-4.1), the nature of the language impairment 
is a high-level auditory processing disorder with the effect of blocking the auditory 
path to language areas, the process of language acquisition in a child whose language 
is not yet fully developed will be blocked. On the other hand, the auditory deprivation 
effect will be less severe in older children, whose language acquisition has already 
been accomplished, even if not to its full extent. 
The auditory processing disorder hypothesis nicely fits with the finding of the poor 
recovery of language following conventional speech therapy, while a substantial im- 
provement has been achieved through the visual modality. Rapin et al. (1977) first 
noted the retained ability of some of these children to acquire language through the 
visual modality. Fostering communication with use of sign language, a method that 
was found very effective in restoring communication in a case of pure word deafness 
following early bilateral temporal damage (Arias et al., 1995), has not been employed 
in LKS children up to now, perhaps because of the reluctance of professionals and 
parents to resort to a method of developing sign language in a nondeaf child (Deonna, 
Beaumanoir, Gaillard, & Assal, 1977). 
The LKS boy reported by Denes, Balliello, Volterra, and Pellegrini (1986) was 
thought, when 6 years old, to match objects to their corresponding written word. The 
boy, whose auditory comprehension and oral production were nil, was able to learn 
reading and writing to such an extent that he could successfully attend primary school. 
36-3. DESCRIPTION 
OF LINGUISTIC 
IMPAIRMENT 
In the most severe cases, children are unresponsive to both verbal and nonverbal 
sounds (cortical deafness), followed by a recovery of the ability to respond to non- 
verbal sounds (Dugas et al., 1982) or, in some cases, to correctly identify the meaning 
of a nonverbal sound, as shown by their correct performance in matching a nonverbal 
meaningful sound with the corresponding picture (Denes et al., 1986). Discrimination 
and identification of vowel and consonant sounds are severely impaired (Deonna et 
al., 1977; Denes et al., 1986). Equally impaired is performance on auditory compre- 
hension tasks, such as the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or the Token Test (Klein 
et al., 1995). Production disorders are equally severe up to almost total disappearance 
of speech, oral production being limited to nonverbal sounds. Singing also can be 
absent. 

512 
Gianfraneo Denes 
In less severe cases, oral production, although defective, is present and a detailed 
analysis has been reported by Van De Sandt-Koenderman, Smit, Van Dongen, and 
Van Hest (1984) in an LKS child who showed a fluctuating course. Total number of 
words and mean length of utterences matched the clinically observed fluctuations of 
aphasia. Analysis of paraphasias showed that most of them could be classified as literal 
paraphasias. Semantic paraphasias were absent, while neologisms, present in the stage 
of language breakdown, tended to disappear very fast during the recovery phase. 
In contrast to the severity of the language impairment in the oral-auditory modality, 
the ability to learn and use written language can be significantly superior. Few ex- 
perimental studies have examined the extent of language achievement through the 
visual modality. C.S., the LKS patient described by Denes et al. (1986), whose oral 
language was totally disrupted, showed a discrepancy between lexico-semantic and 
morphosyntactic aspects of visual language processing. His performance was flawless 
in lexical decision tasks, as well in the written naming subtest of BDAE (Goodglass 
& Kaplan, 1972) and in written naming, following semantic cuing. On the other hand, 
in contrast to age-matched controls, he showed a marked difficulty in handling free 
morphemes (articles, prepositions), whereas he did not show any particular difficulty 
in using bound morphemes that distinguish number, gender, and person. This discrep- 
ancy seems to support Caramazza, Berndt, and Basili's (1981) hypothesis that pro- 
ducing and understanding function words demands some form of phonological coding 
and decoding. 
36-4. HYPOTHESIS 
ON THE 
UNDERLYING 
DEFICITS 
36-4.1. Neurophysiological Findings 
Experimental data pointing to a disruption of a specific neurological pathway as the 
basis of the language comprehension deficit in LKS patients was provided by Gascon, 
Victor, Lombroso, and Goodglass (1973) and Denes et al. (1986), who studied evoked 
responses to auditory stimuli. In both studies, the early components of evoked poten- 
tials (EPs) were normal, while long latency event-related potentials (ERPs), such as 
the P3, were abnormally long in latency and of reduced amplitude. These data point 
to a normal conduction of acoustic stimuli at the peripheral and brainstem level up 
to the cerebral cortex, with a selective difficulty when acoustic stimuli are further 
processed. 
From a neurolinguistic point of view, the application of the EP and ERP method 
can help to disentangle the problem on the nature of auditory comprehension deficit, 
if primarily acoustic in nature or subsequent to a phonemic decoding disorder, leading 
to a selective inability to extract phonetic information from the acoustic speech signal. 
In a recent study, Klein et al. (1995) examined six young adults who had presented 
a pattern of verbal auditory agnosia in childhood and exhibited some residual speech 
processing impairment of varying degrees at the time of testing. Four of them had 

36 
Landau-Kleffner Syndrome 
513 
bilateral EEG abnormalities of epileptic type and had presented epileptic seizures, thus 
confirming the diagnostic criteria of LKS. Auditory brain stem responses (ABRs), 
middle latency responses (MLRs), and ERPs to nonverbal and verbal (synthetic 
consonant-vowel syllables) stimuli were recorded. ABRs and MLRs were normal, 
while ERPs showed an abnormal delay in the N1 component recorded over the lateral 
temporal cortex. This abnormal slowing of processing for speech and nonspeech stim- 
uli seems to suggest a global deficit of auditory processing rather than a language 
specific deficit, supported by a structural, although not detectable, abnormality at the 
level of secondary auditory cortex. 
36-4.2. Behavioral Data 
Tallal and Piercy (1974, 1975) were able to demonstrate a specific deficit in lan- 
guage impaired children in discriminating and indentifying rapidly presented acoustic 
events with a resulting deficit in speech perception. In other studies, Tallal and Stark 
(1987) and Tallal, Sainburg and Jernigan (1991) showed that language-delayed chil- 
dren have a specific difficulty in both perceiving and producing those speech sounds 
and syllables that incorporate rapidly changing acoustic spectra. 
Given the severity of the central acoustic deficit, most LKS patients were unable 
to perform the test. Only two children with visual-auditory agnosie (VAA) and im- 
paired production were given the task and it was found that their performance im- 
proved when the duration of formant transition was artificially lenghtened (Frumkin 
& Rapin, 1980). If, as suggested by previous studies, the deficit is prephonemic, all 
linguistic operations not involving the auditory channel should be performed at a 
normal level. If, on the contrary, the lack of phonemic input has prevented the ac- 
quisition of cerebral phonological abilities, all cognitive processes that require pho- 
nological mediation should be equally affected. 
This question was experimentally investigated by Denes et al. (1986) by submitting 
their LKS patient to a series of tests using the visual modality that requires phono- 
logical mediation. Following Posner's seminal work (Posner, 1978; Posner & Mitchell, 
1967), it is well established that when two letters are visually presented and matched 
for physical identity (e.g., AA), for nomimal identity (e.g., Aa), or for nonidentity 
(e.g., AB), a reaction time (RT) pattern emerges in which physically identical pairs 
are responded to faster than either of the other two types. 
On the basis of this evidence, Posner has suggested that "AN' pairs are matched 
using a visual code, which is generated rapidly and does not involve linguistic anal- 
ysis, while "Aa" pairs are matched using a phonetic or name code, which involves 
the phonetic representation of the letter names. The availability of the two proposed 
codes was investigarted in C.S., and his performance was compared with that of a 
group of 24 children of the same age and school level. C.S.'s performance did not 
significantly differ from that of the normal controls, suggesting an unimpaired avail- 
ability of phonetic or name code. It must be pointed out, however, that Boles and 
Douglas (1983) challanged the existence of the phonetic mediation in name identity 
tasks. In normal subjects, short-term memory (STM) for sequences of phonologically 

514 
Gianfranco Denes 
similar items (strings of letters or acoustically similar words) is worse than for dis- 
similar items. This effect does not depend on the mode of presentation (visual or 
auditory). This and other evidence (Conrad & Hull, 1964; Conrad, 1971; Baddeley, 
1976) has suggested a critical role of phonological mediation in verbal STM. C.S.'s 
mean score was 4, for both similar and dissimilar strings of letters, thus showing no 
effect of phonological similarity. 
36-5. CONCLUSIONS 
Four decades after it was first recognized as an autonomous entity, many aspects of 
LKS remain unresolved: although the hypothesis of the central auditory processing 
disorder as the basis of the language comprehension disorders is suggested by con- 
verging evidence from behavioral and neurophysiological studies, it is not clear why, 
at least in some cases, a regression of written language abilities in some previously 
literate children should appear (Deonna et al., 1977; Mantovani & Landau, 1980). 
Equally thorny is the question why LKS children should, in the absence of de- 
monstrable structural lesions, have a prognosis significantly worse than children with 
aphasia following focal lesions. Morrell et al. (1995) proposed that the presence of 
an epileptogenic focus in language-specific cortex during development would activate 
elements in the language circuitry that would not normally be active and thereby 
perpetuate and sustain synaptic arrangements that are functionally inappropriate. Only 
the cessation of epileptiform discharges through surgery performed before the end of 
the critical period of language acquisition will allow restoration of functionally ap- 
propriate connections within language-specific circuitry. 
Finally, the finding that, following surgical treatment LKS subjects who were lan- 
guage deprived for years can recover at normal level (Morrel et al., 1995) seems to 
show that the language system can survive an almost total deprivation, without any 
major effect on future development.

CHAPTER 37 
The Development of Language in 
Some Neurological Diseases 
Shirin Sarkari, Arlene A. Tan, and Dennis L. Molfese 
Department of Psychology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois 62901 
The development of infants and children with neurological disorders such as 
Down's syndrome, Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, Persistent Hyperin- 
sulineric Hypoglycemia of Infancy, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and Porencephaly 
is reviewed in this chapter. The clinical and neuroanatomical features of each 
syndrome are provided and studies investigating deficits in language development 
and in visuospatial skills specific to each disorder are discussed. 
The development of language is intricately interwoven with neuroanatomical devel- 
opment (Jernigan, Bellugi, Sowell, Doherty, & Hesselink, 1993), development of cog- 
nition (Piaget & Inhelder, 1969), articulatory abilities (Mahoney, Glover, & Finger, 
1981), receptive abilities (Kumin, Councill, & Goodman, 1994), and social develop- 
ment (Williams, 1994). While various deficits associated with any of these factors may 
result in linguistic delays, others may impair the development of visuospatial abilities, 
while preserving language skills. Moreover, some neuroanatomical deficits associated 
with these syndromes may selectively affect the development of language, dissociating 
between different aspects of linguistics. This chapter provides a review of specific 
neurological disorders, focusing on the related language and cognitive impairments 
that are associated with each disease.

37-1. DOWN'S 
SYNDROME 
37-1.1. Neuroanatomical Features 
Down's syndrome (DS) is a congenital condition derived from trisomy of chromosome 
21 in 95% of cases, and is characterized by typical facies and mental retardation 
(Smith & Jones, 1982). Neuroanatomical features include reduced overall cerebral 
volume with relative preservation of the basal ganglia. The frontal cortex is dispro- 
portionately reduced in volume. Moreover, a dramatic reduction of limbic structures 
of the temporal lobes (including the uncus, hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal 
gyrus, etc.) is usually present. There is a striking larger asymmetry in the temporal 
limbic region (Jernigan et al., 1993). 
37-1.2. Language in Down's Syndrome 
A review of research on language development indicates that the pattern and sequence 
of development of language in DS children is similar to that of nonretarded children 
(babbling, developmental patterns of consonant production, etc.) (see Pruess, Vadasy, 
& Fewell, 1987 for a review). However, it has been postulated that deficits in ex- 
pressive language development do occur, possibly due to auditory deficits, articulation 
disorders, cognitive delays, and environmental factors. For example, when DS and 
normal children were chronologically age-matched, DS children were found to show 
a distinct developmental lag in speech production (Leifer & Lewis, 1984). When 
matched with normal controls by mental age, however, DS children were found to be 
superior in conversational response abilities. Leifer and Lewis (1984) concluded that 
during the one-word stage of development, DS children may be more advanced than 
controls, but stay at this stage longer, resulting in delayed language development. 
Evidence indicates that DS children are at risk for malformations of the auditory 
system, such as small external ears and a narrowed external auditory canal. These 
malformations frequently lead to an increased incidence of otitis media in this pop- 
ulation. Whiteman, Simpson, and Compton (1986) report that the recurrence of early 
otitis media may be a contributing factor to language deficits often associated with 
DS children. Although a direct causal relationship between hearing loss and language 
deficits has not yet been established, it is imperative that children with DS receive 
comprehensive auditory assessments regularly in the first few years of life (Kumin et 
al., 1994; Pruess et al., 1987; Strome, 1981; Whiteman et al., 1986). 
Another consideration in the cause of language delays observed in DS children is 
the presence of articulatory deficits due to hypotonicity of the orofacial musculature. 
Mahoney et al. (1981) examined the relationship between sensorimotor and language 
development in DS and non-retarded children with matched developmental ages of 
17 months. They determined that the deficit in language ability was related to poor 
vocal imitation skills. However, Mahoney and Snow (1983)concluded that cognitive 
and sensorimotor factors were significantly correlated with expressive language delays. 
The relationship between cognitive abilities and language development has been in- 

37 
Language and Neurological Diseases 
517 
vestigated by various researchers (Hill & McCune-Nicolich, 1981; Moore & Meltzoff, 
1978; Piaget & Inhelder, 1969; Smith & von Tetzchner, 1986). The development of 
object permanence and object identity has been found to be a crucial aspect of lan- 
guage formation. Hence both cognition and articulatory ability are implicated in the 
deficits in language seen in the DS population. 
An additional aspect to the evaluation of expressive language development is the 
assessment of phoneme acquisition. Normative data previously reported require a mas- 
tery level based on achieving 75-90% accuracy in phonemic production (e.g., Smit, 
Hand, Freilinger, Bernthal, & Bird, 1990). More recently, Kumin et al. (1994) pos- 
tulate a change in approach to the evaluation process in DS children. Rather than 
mastery of specific phonemes as measured by formalized articulation testing, the au- 
thors suggest looking at the emergence of sounds, and the use of these emergent 
phonemes in daily communication. 
Other theories have been introduced in an attempt to account for the language 
deficits observed in DS children. For example, Bird and Chapman (1994) tested the 
hypothesis that DS patients experience most difficulty with language tasks due to a 
"pervasive sequencing" deficit, where recalling the order of information is problem- 
atic (Rosin, Swift, Bless, & Kluppel Vetter, 1988). According to Bird and Chapman 
(1994), neither a deficit in sequential processing nor specific difficulties in recalling 
order of information were found. Alternatively, these authors suggest that deficits in 
auditory working memory span and a rate-based limitation to the phonological loop 
could account for the problems in language production observed in DS individuals. 
However, these possibilities need to be validated by future research. 
Mundy, Kasari, Sigman, and Ruskin (1995) proposed that the acquisition and de- 
velopment of nonverbal communication skills impact development of language. These 
skills reflect the development of cognitive processes (e.g., capacity for representational 
thought, executive functions such as selective inhibition of responses, and planned 
action sequences). Mundy et al. (1995) found that DS children were impaired in 
nonverbal requesting regardless of developmental level. In addition, nonverbal re- 
questing was positively correlated with language outcome. These findings supported 
those of Mundy, Sigman, Kasari, and Yirmiya (1988) and Beeghly, Weiss-Perry, and 
Cicchetti (1990). 
Few studies have investigated language comprehension in DS individuals. Chap- 
man, Schwartz, and Bird (1991) found that the differences between lexical and syn- 
tactic skills differed with increasing age in DS children. Although the differences are 
distinct, the source of the discrepancy remains unresolved. Chapman et al. (1991) 
suggest that the differences may be either the result of a lexical advantage or due to 
a syntactic deficiency. 
The studies cited above provide evidence for many contributing factors, but further 
research in psycholinguistics and the acquisition of language is needed in many areas 
before the language deficiency associated with DS can be fully understood. Causes of 
language delays in DS children are still debatable, with problems with hearing and 
cognitive difficulties being contributors, but not necessarily causal factors. Instruc- 
tional strategies need to be highly structured and a clear "best way" has not been 

518 
Shirin Sarkari et al. 
found. Language intervention should occur early, with families and school being very 
involved in the process so that the best use can be made of experiences occurring 
naturally. 
37-2. WILLIAMS SYNDROME 
37-2.1. Neuroanatomical and Clinical Features 
Williams Syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease that may have an 
idiopathic or a genetic etiology. It occurs in around 1 in 25,000 live births (Udwin & 
Yule, 1991). First described in 1961 by Williams, Barratt-Boyes, and Lowe, the dis- 
tinguishing physical defect is a supravalvular aortic stenosis that impedes blood flow 
from the aorta. This disorder is found predominantly (90%) in males. An abnormal 
regulation of calcitonin may result in an infantile hypercalcemia, which causes an 
abnormal density of the bones. This often causes cranial sutures to close early, giving 
rise to micro-encephaly in some cases (Culler, Jones, & Deftos, 1985). Increased 
intracranial pressures, hernia, and cardiovascular anomalies are also present in severe 
cases. Other features include an elfin-like facies and mild to moderate mental retar- 
dation (with IQ scores in the 40-60 range), but with relative preservation of linguistic 
and affective skills (Wang & Bellugi, 1994). 
In early infancy, irritability, failure to thrive, and feeding difficulties have been 
described. Common features of WS include hyperacusis, hyperactivity, deficient social 
skills, and inappropriate behaviors. Commonly, oral-cavity malformations, including 
microdontia, hypoplasia of the enamel, caries, and missing teeth have been described. 
Occlusal problems such as micrognathia and prognathia are also found in many cases 
of WS (Myerson & Frank, 1987). 
Cerebral MRIs of WS individuals have shown that cerebral volume is significantly 
decreased, while neocerebellar vermal lobules are increased in size when compared 
to DS children (Wang, Hesselink, Jernigan, Doherty, & Bellugi, 1992). 
37-2.2. Language in Williams Syndrome 
One distinctive feature of WS is the dissociation of language and cognitive functions. 
WS individuals display superior language abilities in contrast to impaired cognitive 
functions (Wang & Bellugi, 1993; Wang, Doherty, Hesselink, & Bellugi, 1992). Ac- 
cording to Reilly, Klima, and Bellugi (1991), adolescents with WS are not capable of 
resolving conservation tasks; that is, in a standard Piagetian situation, the children are 
unable to determine whether one row of objects contains more or fewer elements if 
the overall length of the two rows is the same. However, these same children excel 
in receptive and expressive vocabulary tasks. WS individuals also possess a remark- 
able command of grammar and vocal prosody. 
In a longitudinal study of early lexical development, WS, DS, and normal children, 
aged 13-26 months, were followed for 15-26 months (Mervis & Bertrand, 1995). 

37 
Language and Neurological Diseases 
519 
Children with WS were found to do significantly better in language items than in 
cognitive items, whereas DS children displayed the opposite pattern. Normal children 
passed equal numbers of language and cognitive items. 
Wang and Bellugi (1993) tested a group of 10 adolescents with WS, comparing 
their performance with DS subjects who were matched for age, full scale IQ (FSIQ) 
score (41-59), and educational background. A wide battery of tests including tests for 
cognitive functioning, language, and neurophysiological measures was administered. 
Both WS and DS subjects displayed general impairments in cognition. Subjects were 
also tested separately on each subdomain of languagemgrammar, affective prosody, 
semantics, and narrative abilities. Subjects with WS performed above expected levels 
relative to their cognitive abilities. They had large vocabularies and used significantly 
more uncommon words than either the DS subjects or normal controls. WS subjects 
also produced more syntactically and morphologically complex and well-formed sen- 
tences than children of equal mental age. In addition, these subjects showed good 
paralinguistic skills, including narration and affect. 
In contrast to studies finding a high degree of loquacity and verbal skill in WS 
subjects, other researchers have found low FSIQs (between 41 and 72) with no sig- 
nificant verbal and performance differences (Bennett, LaVeck, & Sells, 1978; Arnold, 
Yule, & Martin, 1985). Strang and Rourke (1985) have identified one group of WS 
children as resembling what they describe as "a nonverbal perceptual organization- 
output disability" (NPOOD). These children are characterized as being overly talka- 
tive, with no notable difficulty with syntax, but having a tendency to use clich6s often, 
and with an unfocused quality to their speech. 
Kataria, Goldstein, and Kushnik (1984) tested seven children with WS, 18-71 
months old, (M = 48 months). All were from lower-middle-class to middle-class 
backgrounds. All had borderline to severe mental retardation. The five youngest chil- 
dren were tested with the Mental Scale from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 
(Bayley, 1969). The two older children were tested with the Stanford-Binet Intelli- 
gence Scale (Terman & Merrill, 1973). The Receptive-Expressive Emergent Language 
Scale (Bzoch & League, 1978) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) 
(Dunn, 1959) were used to test specific language development in the older and 
younger children, respectively. In addition, motor development was tested. Follow-up 
testing of intelligence and language development was completed 14-42 months after 
the first evaluation. All seven children tested in the mild to severe retarded range (IQs 
28-64 [M = 50.6]). Five of the seven children had relatively high verbal skills when 
compared to their performance subtests. None, however, reached the statistical .05 
level of significance. The average range for language scores was not even close, as 
would have been expected from earlier reports. This is an important finding as re- 
medial early intervention can be attempted to maximize whatever potential these chil- 
dren have. 
Although it may appear that children with WS are verbally strong and possess 
superior articulatory skills, these very attributes could mask more debilitating cog- 
nitive deficits. Continued research in this area, with children and adult patients, 
would contribute to more skillful interventions. Further, cross-sectional studies with 

520 
Shirin Sarkari et al. 
larger sample sizes would help determine the justifiability of differing findings in 
this population. 
37-3. TURNER SYNDROME 
37-3.1. Anatomical Features 
Turner Syndrome (TS) affects 1 in 2,500 newborn female children. The anatomical 
characteristics of children with TS include a chromosomal variation of chromosome 
45, X (XO syndrome), with all or part of one X chromosome missing; gonadal 
dysgenesis; and congenital renal and cardiac anomalies. Other physical features in- 
clude sexual infantilism, webbed neck, elbow deformations, small stature, and high- 
frequency hearing loss (50%). 
37-3.2. Cognitive Impairments 
TS has been associated with a high incidence of neurocognitive impairment. This is 
specific to mental processing and sequencing of rotational transformations of shapes 
in the spatial dimensions of left/right, up/down, front/back (Money, 1993; Williams, 
Richman, & Yarbrough, 1992). The syndrome does not affect verbal intelligence but 
may severely affect nonverbal functioning (Williams, 1994). A marked and significant 
disparity between Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ) may be >30 points 
with a VIQ of > 130 (Money, 1993). 
In daily living, the deficit in spatial processing may prove a handicap in such tasks 
as map reading, following travel directions, deciphering sounds stereophonically, and 
recognition of facial expressions (Money, 1993). There is no handicap in learning to 
read with a rotational transformation disabilitymin fact, there is an advantage as these 
children do not mix their p/q, b/d, and so on. 
Lewandowski, Costenbader, and Richman (1984) tested 10 females with TS be- 
tween 9 and 33 years of age. The researchers found that the subjects scored signifi- 
cantly lower in PIQ in comparison to controls. There was no difference in VIQ scores 
between TS subjects and controls. TS subjects performed significantly poorer than 
controls on the Raven Color Progressive Matrices, providing further evidence for the 
hypothesis that TS subjects have a visuoperceptual deficit independent of verbal, mem- 
ory, and motor skills. 
Shucard, Shucard, Clopper, and Schacter (1992) found that TS females are deficient 
in visual-spatial processing tasks. Again, VIQ scores between TS subjects and controls 
did not differ significantly, although the comprehension and arithmetic subtests 
showed lower scores in TS subjects. 
Williams (1994) tested 10 children with TS on various measures including behav- 
ioral and verbal abilities. The controls were 10 children with no learning disability 
history, who were acting as controls in another endocrinology study. Ten other chil- 
dren diagnosed with a nonverbal learning disability (NLD) were also recruited into 
the study. No overall significant main effect for age or VIQ was found (p > .05). 

37 
Language and Neurological Diseases 
521 
37-3.3. Language in Turner Syndrome 
Language acquisition in TS subjects does not appear to be impaired. TS children tend 
to have verbal and language abilities with the average range, although spatial relations 
and poor perceptual motor organization skills tend to pull down nonverbal scores. 
Visual-spatial functioning and nonverbal learning disabilities are the areas in which 
they show deficits (Netley, 1983; Williams, 1994). In addition to nonverbal learning 
disabilities, Williams (1994) describes these children with TS as having problems with 
peer relationships, behavior, and social functioning. 
37-4. PERSISTENT HYPERINSULINERIC 
HYPOGLYCEMIA 
OF INFANCY 
37-4.1. Clinical Features 
Persistent Hyperinsulineric Hypoglycemia of Infancy (PHHI) is a condition wherein 
significant and rapidly occurring low glucose levels in the blood may result in seizure 
activity and permanent CNS damage. Diagnostic criteria include: 
1. Serum glucose levels of <40mg/dL. during the first 72 hours, with detectable 
circulating insulin levels; 
2. Low levels of free fatty acids and ketones during hypoglycemic episodes; 
3. A glucose requirement of > 15mg/kg/min; and 
4. A glycemic response to glucagon despite hypoglycemia (Aynsley-Green, 
Polak, & Bloom, 1981). 
Hypoglycemia in infancy may lead to irreversible damage in the central nervous 
system. The brain damage noted is similar to that found with ischemia (Auer, Wieloch, 
Olsson, & Siesjo, 1984). In the autopsies of three children with hypoglycemia, exten- 
sive degeneration of neurons throughout the CNS was noted. Basal ganglia and oc- 
cipital lobes showed the most degeneration (Anderson, Milner, & Strich, 1967). 
37-4.2. Language in PHHI 
In a study by Gross-Tsur, Shalev, Wertman-Elad, Landau, and Amir (1994), seven 
school-age PHHI patients and six healthy controls matched for age, sex, IQ, and 
socioeconomic status (SES) underwent a battery of tests. IQs of six out of the seven 
were in the normal range (FSIQ scores 91-123; the sixth had an FSIQ of 65). How- 
ever, writing skills and serial-word learning of PHHI patients were found to be sig- 
nificantly impaired. This was demonstrated by primary phonetic errors in the spelling 
of words, and missing letters and words. Frontal lobe functioning appeared normal 
even though the Trail Making Test showed slowed times. This could have been due 
in one case to the medication (Phenobarbital) given for control of the epilepsy. Gross- 
Tsur et al. (1994) describe the neuropsychological profile of the children in their study 
as suggesting bilateral posterior hemispheric dysfunction. 

522 
Shirin Sarkari et al. 
A number of studies with PHHI children have shown a pattern of normal devel- 
opment (Gough, 1984; Hirsch et a1.,1977; Horev, Ipp, Levey, & Daneman, 1991). 
Although mental retardation and severe neurological defects are not common with 
good postnatal care, seizures, learning disabilities, and motor incoordination are seen. 
Overall, it appears that the more aggressively the PHHI infants were treated to stabilize 
their glucose levels and seizure activity early in development, the better their neuro- 
logical outcomes. 
37-5. STURGE-WEBER 
SYNDROME 
Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) patients are characterized by the presence of facial 
angioma, a portwine stain or nevus, involving the upper face, periorbital region, and 
ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis. The angioma can involve the mucous mem- 
branes, nasopharynx, and ocular choroidal membrane, resulting in glaucoma in about 
25% of patients. A hemiparesis is present in around 25% of patients with SWS. 
Hemianopia occurs in about 25% of patients, but is difficult to assess in very young 
children. 
SWS can cause partial or generalized seizures, infantile spasms, and myoclonic 
seizures, with a relentless progression of frequency and severity of seizure activity. 
Intracranial calcifications typically assume a linear-parallel configuration or a con- 
volutional pattern, most often in the parietal or parieto-occipital regions. MRI scans 
show a thickened cortex, decreased convolutions, and areas of abnormal white 
matter. 
A study by Chugani, Mazziotta, and Phelps (1989) looked at PET scans of patients 
with SWS and found that hypometabolism and hypermetabolism in the brain were 
common. Chiron et al. (1989) studied this population with a regional cerebral blood 
flow (rCBF) paradigm, and in all six patients in the group saw an rCBF decrease in 
a large cortical and subcortical area in the affected hemisphere. The decrease of rCBF 
was remarkable--ranging from 32 to 75%. 
A study from the Mayo Clinic showed that 47% of patients had a subnormal 
intelligence (Gomez & Bebin, 1987). Mental retardation was more likely in patients 
with seizure disorders. Hemispherectomy or lobectomy is considered if seizures prove 
intractable in order to preserve mental function. 
37-5.1. Language in Sturge-Weber Syndrome 
Studies involving patients with SWS who underwent a hemidecortication in infancy 
show that though written language acquisition is possible, competency is dependent 
on the hemisphere that remains. Generally, the isolated left hemisphere appears to be 
involved in the grammatical structures of English (Dennis, Lovett, & Wiegel-Crump, 
1981). Lovett, Dennis, and Newman (1986) found that in hemidecorticate adolescents 
who had SWS the use of referential language was again dependent on the remaining 
hemisphere.

37-6. PORENCEPHALY 
37-6.1. Clinical Features 
Porencephaly is a congenital anomaly described as a focal defect of the cerebral 
mantle, where the "pore" connects the subarachnoid space with the ventricles. The 
region is often served by the major cerebral arteries (Levine, Fisher, & Caveness, 
1974). Although the definite cause is not known, it is probably caused by an intrau- 
terine insult during the second half of pregnancy. 
Children with porencephaly may develop raised intracranial pressure, seizures, 
hemisensory deficits, hemiparesis, visual field defects, and hydrocephalus. Destruction 
of the brain tissue occurs in the area of the brain where the defect is found. If the 
anomaly involves the left hemisphere, then problems with language are more likely. 
However, in a case study, Frazen, Tishelman, Seime, and Friedman (1986) describe 
a female congenital porencephaly individual who was studied at age 42. Although she 
had a congenital massive LH anomaly, part of her left hemisphere missing, her lan- 
guage development was adequate. She reported that she had had no special education 
and graduated from high school without problems, although she often felt slower than 
her peers, and thought she had to work a lot harder. She had similar experiences in 
college but received her M.A. degree just 1 year late. She held a job in a technical 
library and at this point self-referred for a neuropsychological exam. She was expe- 
riencing problems with making quick decisions, with memory, and in logical thinking. 
She was evaluated with a comprehensive battery of tests. 
CT scan localized a porencephalic cyst in the LH. The results show a pattern of 
spatial task weaknesses and adequate skills in verbal subtests. She received the lowest 
score in Block Design, usually considered an RH task, an area of the brain in which 
the scan showed no anomalies. These results are consistent with other findings, which 
show that in the presence of a considerable LH or RH lesion the functions will transfer 
to the opposite hemisphere (Bigler & Naugle, 1985). 
37-6.2. Language in Porencephaly 
The spatial skills are more likely to be impaired than verbal skills in presence of a 
lesion in either the LH or the RH. As noted earlier, a LH lesion is more likely to 
result in a language impairment. 
37-7. CONCLUSION 
The review in this chapter provides a brief insight into the various deficits associated 
with neurological diseases. Although in some cases a severe language problem is clear, 
as in the case of Down's syndrome, other diseases such as Williams syndrome more 
severely impact cognitive abilities. Overall, it is obvious that each of these neuroan- 
atomically related problems do impact some aspect of language functioning in the 

524 
Shirin Sarkari et al. 
individual. Hence, it is important that such problems are detected early in life. With 
early detection and the implementation of intervention programs, along with special 
personalized care and training, infants with such neurological diseases may be able to 
develop to optimal levels, given that the brain is more resilient and plastic during the 
critical periods of development early in life. Although it is clear that many language 
deficits are associated with the various syndromes reviewed in this chapter, detailed 
information continues to be lacking with respect to porencephaly, PHHI, SWS, and 
TS. Further research into language processes is needed in these areas. With the avail- 
ability of added information, more specialized intervention techniques may be de- 
signed, wherein infants diagnosed with any of these syndromes may be provided with 
better language experiences, enabling them to maximize their linguistic and cognitive 
development. 

CHAPTER 38 
Language and Communication 
Disorders in Autism and 
Asperger's Syndrome 
Francesca Happ~ 
Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Research Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, London, UK 
Communication problems form one of the key diagnostic criteria for autism. As 
with the other diagnostic criteria (social impairments, restricted interests) there 
is a wide variety of manifestations. The challenge is to understand such diverse 
problems as Kanner-type mutism and Asperger-type loquaciousness in terms of 
a unifying cognitive theory. The theory that autistic individuals are unable to 
represent mental states can shed light on the nature of the whole range of com- 
munication impairments, while still allowing for the presence of islets of ability 
in other areas. This theory predicts that the specific deficit lies in the use of 
language to affect other minds. Normal language acquisition appears to build on 
the ability to recognize and orient toward ostensive behavior. Children with au- 
tism fail to share attention and appear insensitive to the speaker's intentions. 
Such deficits may be sufficient to explain the almost universal prevalence of lan- 
guage delay in children with autism, without postulating additional language 
impairments. Autism, then, provides a model for studying the important distinc- 
tion between language and communication, and demonstrates the vital part that 
"mind reading" plays in normal verbal and nonverbal interaction.

This chapter reviews current work on language and communication in autism, and 
explores what this disorder can tell us about the cognitive capacities that underlie 
normal communicative functioning and language acquisition. I will focus in particular 
on one cognitive theory of autism; although there are many current hypotheses of the 
core cognitive impairment, one in particular has wide-ranging implications for our 
understanding of autistic language and communication. Before this, however, it is 
necessary to take a step back and look at what it means to communicate. 
38-1. LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION 
As many authors, including Grice and more recently Sperber and Wilson (1986), have 
made clear, language and communication are distinct processes. Although we com- 
monly use language (a grammar-governed representational system) to communicate, 
words and sentences are just one type of tool that can be employed. Communication 
has to do with conveying our intended meanings, and we can convey our intentions 
in any number of different ways: we can use gestures, pantomime, gaze, and so forth 
to let another person "read our mind." The precedence of intended thought over 
spoken word is evident in our ability to understand nonliteral language such as indirect 
requests, metaphor, and other "loose usage." 
It seems that young children too are more interested in intentions than words. In 
fact, it may be this bias that leads preschoolers to make errors in message-evaluation 
tasks--apparently believing that they know the speaker's intended meaning even when 
the surface form of the utterance is in fact uninformative. This "blindness" to literal 
meaning should, perhaps, be seen not as an immaturity but as a normal feature of the 
precedence of communication over language. After all, this precedence remains in 
adults too; think of the case of asking, "Would you mind telling me what time you 
open?" to which a common answer begins, "Yes, of course .... 
" 
What underlies the extraordinary flexibility of communication? We can begin to 
answer this question by exploring the possible dissociations between language and 
communication: communication is possible without language, but communication can 
also fail in the presence of apparently good language skills. This brings us to the case 
of autism. 
38-2. AUTISTIC LANGUAGE 
AND COMMUNICATION 
Autism is a profound developmental disorder, with biological origin, that affects 
around 1 in 1,000 children born, and lasts throughout life (Frith, 1989b). Recent years 
have brought the recognition that autism can have a range of manifestations, from 
mild to severe, with or without additional handicaps and mental retardation. What is 
common, and definitional, across this spectrum of disorders is a constellation of im- 

38 
Language and Communication in Autism 
527 
pairments in socialization, communication, and imagination, with a restricted reper- 
toire of interests and activities. 
In current practice, impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication form an 
important part of the diagnostic criteria for autism (e.g., DSM-IV; American Psychi- 
atric Association, 1994). What do we know about autistic communication? Perhaps 
the most striking finding is the great variety of problems seen. Consider the clinical 
picture presented by three individuals with autism. At one extreme is the child with 
no language and, strikingly, no compensating gesture or sign language. Such a child 
may be "aloof" and, because of a failure to orient to speech (Klin, 1991), deafness 
may be suspected (though subsequently ruled out). The child may be mute, but need 
not be silent; odd vocalizations, not resembling babbling, may be made, and can 
sometimes be decoded by parents as signals of the child's mood or needs. These cries, 
however, are idiosyncratic and are not understood by parents of other autistic children 
(Ricks & Wing, 1976). The child may show evidence of good auditory memory; for 
example, singing a complex melody heard only once. The child may lack gestures, 
but need not be motionless; odd stereotypical movements (hand flapping, toe walking) 
vie with surprisingly agile purposeful actions (spinning coins, climbing roofs). 
A second type of child, particularly well described by Kanner (1943), has some 
language, while still showing a striking inability to communicate. Echolalia, either 
immediate or delayed, may serve in some cases a self-stimulatory function, and in 
others may be used in an instrumental or code-like waymfor example, after receiving 
a gift, saying "You say 'Thank you!' ". Well known is the example of saying "Do 
you want a biscuit?" to mean "I want a biscuit." Such wholesale parroting is probably 
the source of much of the pronoun reversal ("you" for "I") common in autism. It is 
remarkable that in these echoed phrases the speaker's original intonation is often well 
preserved--in stark contrast to the lack of normal modulation in spontaneous speech 
(Fay & Schuler, 1980). The same child may use single words in a simple, associative 
way, so that "Apple" always means "Give me apple." The single words acquired are 
often esoteric (e.g., "Beethoven") and not like the first words of a normally devel- 
oping preschooler. Neologisms (e.g., "bawcet" for "bossy"; Volden & Lord, 1991), 
or familiar words with special meanings ("yes" meaning "carry me on your shoul- 
ders"; Kanner, 1943), also reflect the very concrete association of word and object. 
The child may memorize complex verbal material, which commonly has little meaning 
for him/her (e.g., an encyclopedia index page, a French lullaby). It is also common 
for such a child to start reading words, even apparently "teaching himself to read." 
The third type of child may have very advanced, adult-like language skills. Several 
such children were described by Asperger (1944/1991) as sounding "like little pro- 
fessors." Vocabulary in particular may be extensive, and syntax is more formally 
correct than is usual in everyday speech. However, content and use of language are 
often bizarre. It is, typically, impossible to sustain a conversation with such a child; 
either yes/no answers are given, or the topic is hijacked to the child's own special 
interest--at which point a monologue on train times, pylons, or beetles ensues. Such 
a child usually shows overliteral understanding of communicationmfor example, ask- 
ing earnestly for glue when told, "stick your coat down over there." Although single 

528 
Francesca Happ~ 
words are correctly used, discourse and narrative are disjointed, hard to follow, and 
lacking in coherence. No longer aloof, this child may seek social contact, even with 
strangers, for example, with repetitive questioning. Voice, prosody, intonation, and 
timing all tend to be odd; monotone, singsong, too soft, too fast, or stressing unim- 
portant parts of the utterance (Fine, Bartolucci, Ginsberg, & Szatmari, (1991). Odd, 
wooden, or overblown gestures may accompany speech, typically lacking coordination 
with verbal content. Eye gaze may be staring, rather than averted as in the aloof child. 
Such individuals are likely to receive the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, which is 
currently used for individuals at the able end of the autism spectrum (Frith, 1991). 
These three children may, in fact, be one and the same child at different ages, or 
three members of the same family (Frith, 1991). There is good reason, then, to think 
of the three pictures as different manifestations of a similar underlying handicap. What 
is that handicap? 
38-3. COGNITIVE THEORIES: UNDERSTANDING 
THE MIND IN AUTISM 
The puzzling constellation of symptoms in autism has provoked a large number of 
theories concerning the underlying cognitive impairment (see Happ6, 1994 for a re- 
view). At the present time, accounts split into two broad types: those that posit a 
primary impairment in social development, and those that suggest a more or less 
widespread nonsocial deficit with secondary social consequences. In this latter group 
is the hypothesis that autism is characterized by impaired "executive functions" (e.g., 
Ozonoff, Rogers, & Pennington, 1991). Difficulties in higher cognitive functions, such 
as inhibition of prepotent responses, shifting set, planning, and monitoring action, are 
suggested to underlie the restricted interests and insistence on sameness in autism, and 
to cause social difficulties as a result. An alternative, though compatible, hypothesis 
of nonsocial impairment in autism comes from the anatomical investigations of Cour- 
chesne, which find evidence of cerebellar damage and parietal lobe abnormalities in 
many individuals with autism (Courchesne et al., 1994). An impairment in rapid shift- 
ing of attention is postulated, which might disrupt social functioning from an early 
age by interfering with the child's development of shared attention and social refer- 
encing. As we will see, the major challenge to these nonsocial theories is to explain 
how the very specific pattern of impaired and intact abilities in autism could be caused 
by early deficits in these domain-general processes. 
Cognitive theories suggesting a primary social impairment in autism are numerous, 
and in recent years have converged on many common ideas. A number of researchers 
have shown that older children with autism have difficulty reading facial expressions, 
sharing attention, and so forth (work reviewed in Baron-Cohen, Tager-Flusberg, & 
Cohen, 1993). What is still in dispute is the causal and primary status of such deficits; 
for example, Hobson suggests that autism is the result of an early lack of "personal 
relatedness" or emotional connection to others which he claims is the foundation for 
social cognition. Sigman and colleagues give early joint attention deficits primary 
causal status in autism, while Gopnik and Meltzoff, for example, hypothesize a dam- 

38 
Language and Communication in Autism 
529 
aging lack of neonatal imitation (see chapters in Baron-Cohen et al., 1993). To date 
we lack the data to decide among these different accounts of the primary impairment 
in autism because this disorder is rarely diagnosed before the third year. Although the 
primary impairment causing social difficulties is still uncertain, there is more agree- 
ment concerning the nature of the social impairment in children and adults with 
autism. 
38-4. THE THEORY OF MIND HYPOTHESIS 
Perhaps the most influential theory in recent years has proposed that children and 
adults with autism are impaired in "theory of mind" or "mentalizing"--that is, the 
ability to attribute independent mental states to self and others in order to explain and 
predict behavior (Frith, 1989b). This hypothesis has been successful in predicting 
impairments in the ability to understand false beliefs, deception, ignorance, and knowl- 
edge (work reviewed in Baron-Cohen et al., 1993; Happ6, 1994). It also provides a 
good explanation for the observed lack of pretend play, social understanding, and 
empathy (Frith, 1989b). It fits the observed range of manifestations: a child without 
theory of mind may be aloof, passive, or socially active in odd ways. The theory 
makes sense of otherwise puzzling behavioral observations; for instance, children with 
autism, when playing a simple game, show pleasure at winning but do not coordinate 
their smiling with eye contact to communicate their glee to others (Kasari, Sigman, 
Baumgartner, & Stipek, 1993). 
Experimental work prompted by the theory of mind hypothesis has shown that 
individuals with autism are most clearly impaired where the listener's thoughts and 
feelings must be taken into account (Frith, 1989a; Tager-Flusberg, 1993). The first 
demonstration used a false belief task, in which the child must predict where Sally 
will look for her ball, having been out of the room when Ann moved it. Normal 4- 
year-olds understand that Sally will look in the old, now-empty location because she 
acts on her mistaken belief, but even able individuals with autism expect Sally to look 
where the ball really is--failing to take her mental state into account. This impairment 
in mentalizing leads to a specific pattern of intact and deficient performance. Individ- 
uals with autism can comprehend and use pointing to direct action, but not to direct 
and share attention; they can use gestures to modulate behavior but not to change 
thoughts and feelings; they can supply information but do not take account of listeners' 
needs in supplying the relevant missing facts; they can conceal objects but fail to 
conceal informative clues in a penny-hiding game; they often score well on the In- 
formation subtest but badly on the Comprehension subtest of the Wechsler scales; on 
vocabulary tests, lacunae are shown for words to do with feelings and mental states 
(work reviewed by Happ6 1994, and in Baron-Cohen et al., 1993). These "fine cuts," 
between apparently similar behaviors that differ only in their requirement for mental- 
izing, are shown only in individuals with autism. Nonsocial deficit theories of autism 
have not, to date, risen to the challenge of explaining these findings, and although 
there is considerable debate among social deficit accounts concerning, for example, 
the possible precursors to theory of mind (Baron-Cohen et al., 1993), there is 

530 
Francesca Happ~ 
widespread agreement that the idea of "mind blindness" captures something important 
about the nature of autism. 
Even those autistic individuals who do pass simple theory of mind tasks (requiring 
attribution of a false belief to a story character) seem to show impairments on higher- 
order theory of mind tasks, failing to attribute more complex mental states (e.g., 
intention to deceive) to speakers in short scenarios (Happ6, 1994). Rather than dis- 
proving the mentalizing hypothesis, the existence of these individuals has important 
implications for refining this theory. Level of theory of mind performance seems to 
relate closely to the ability to understand similes, metaphors, and irony (as predicted 
by relevance theory; Sperber & Wilson, 1986) in individuals with autism and in nor- 
mally developing young children (Happ6, 1993). 
38-5. DEVELOPMENTAL 
EFFECTS 
OF MENTALIZING 
DEFICITS 
The experimental studies summarized above, like most to date, explore the moment- 
to-moment effects of theory of mind, and its impairment, on communication; that is, 
studies of protodeclarative pointing, gesture, and so on, tap the individual's ability to 
understand the audience's mental state, and gear his/her communication to affect that 
state. Lack of ability to attribute mental states in moment-to-moment processing time 
will thwart communicative interaction in both production and comprehension, leading 
to difficulties in understanding indirect requests and other nonliteral language. Direct 
effects of lack of mentalizing, such as these, may be rather different from the long- 
term or developmental effects of this cognitive deficit. For example, one can imagine 
an adult car-crash survivor with damage to the neurological system underlying men- 
talizing, who can no longer imagine the mental states of others on-line, but who has, 
nonetheless, all the accumulated routines for insightful social and communicative be- 
havior intact. One group in which on-line mentalizing may be disrupted is patients 
with acquired right-hemisphere damage, who are known to show pragmatic impair- 
ments (e.g., failure to comprehend indirect requests, jokes, metaphors; Foldi, 1987). 
Indeed, it has been suggested that autism, and especially Asperger's syndrome, resem- 
bles right-hemisphere disorder in cognitive profile (Ellis, Ellis, Frazer, & Deb, 1994; 
Klin, Volkmar, Sparrow, Cicchetti, & Rourke, 1995). Brain scans have given direct 
evidence of right-hemisphere involvement in three cases of Asperger's syndrome 
(McKelvey, Lambert, Mottron, & Shevell, 1995), although the causal status of the 
abnormalities found, and the generality of these findings, are as yet uncertain. 
What might be the developmental effects on communication of deficits in mental- 
izing from birth? In particular, what functions does mentalizing serve in the normal 
development of language? Although language acquisition could not even begin with- 
out the existence of innate, dedicated cognitive systems, it will be facilitated by other 
processes of development, including social development. Language acquisition ap- 
pears to make great use of the normal infant's tendency to orient to ostensive behavior 
and to follow and share another's focus of attention. Recent work has highlighted the 

38 
Language and Communication in Autism 
531 
role of joint attention in lexical acquisition. For example, Baldwin (1995) has asked 
how it is that mapping errors are avoided in normal word learning. For example, what 
happens when infants hear a new word (spoken by an adult talking on the phone, 
perhaps) while they just happen to be focused on an incorrect novel object? What 
happens when the baby's attention is momentarily distracted by another object, while 
the parent is labeling something on which the baby had previously been focused? 
Baldwin's work has shown that such unintended object-word pairings do not, typi- 
cally, lead to incorrect lexical acquisition, precisely because infants appear to be sen- 
sitive to the speaker's focus of attention. In such cases, children of 18 months typically 
look to the adult and follow his/her line of regard. Without this sensitivity to the 
speaker's focus of attention, it is hard to see how ostension could serve as the useful 
aid to word learning that it, in fact, seems to be. 
Autistic children do not orient preferentially to ostension, nor share attention--and 
this may be one of the earliest signs of the disorder (Baron-Cohen, Allen, & Gillberg, 
1992). In the light of Baldwin's work, it is fascinating to speculate, then, on the source 
of the idiosyncratic word use that is reported in many individuals with autism (Volden 
& Lord, 1991). For example, Kanner (1943) reports the case of Paul, whose habit of 
exclaiming "Peter eater" whenever he saw a saucepan was traced back to when his 
mother dropped a saucepan while reciting to him the well-known nursery rhyme. This 
appears to be an example of a mapping error, of precisely the type that does not occur 
in normal language learning. 
It is possible, then, that the developmental effects of theory of mind impairment 
may account for the autistic child's problems in acquiring language. Perhaps a quarter 
of such children remain mute, and almost without exception language delays are re- 
ported (Frith 1988b). Severe mental handicap may explain some cases of muteness, 
and it is possible that additional, superimposed language problems may occur in some 
children, just as a few autistic children have additional sensory or motor handicaps. 
However, it seems plausible that a lack of mentalizing might have as one consequence 
a failure to orient to and use human language. That is to say, communication may be 
necessary for normal language development. The autistic child's failure to orient pref- 
erentially to speech, to share attention, and to use eye gaze to disambiguate an adult's 
intention (Baron-Cohen et al., 1993) would be a particularly damaging combination 
of factors for the acquisition of words. 
Although morphology, phonology, semantics, and syntax in autism have not re- 
ceived as much attention in recent research as might be wished, it appears that the 
underlying cognitive substrates for language are, as a rule, intact in individuals with 
autism (Tager-Flusberg, 1993). Therefore, alternative routes to word learning can be 
successful, if slow. Thus some children with autism acquire a limited vocabulary used 
to achieve concrete ends, and others acquire extensive sight vocabularies of words 
not fully understood. Written language vocabulary, interestingly, is not normally ac- 
quired through ostensionmand this may be why many autistic children do not suffer 
significant delay in learning to read and spell. Reading is sometimes reported to pre- 
cede speech, reading accuracy typically exceeds comprehension, and hyperlexia is 
particularly common in autism (Frith & Snowling, 1983). 

532 
Francesca Happ6 
The phonological and syntactic skills that the verbal autistic child demonstrates in 
reading are also manifest in the delight often taken in puns and word games (Van 
Bourgondien & Mesibov, 1987). One able autistic boy composed a whole "joke" 
book, starting with an overheard joke: "Where does a sick wasp go? A Waspital"; 
followed by "Where does a sick Alex go? An Alexpital," and so on, repetitively, 
through a long list of names. 
Thus, although it used to be thought that autism was at heart a language disorder 
(a problem of symbolic abstract thought), the present argument proposes that language 
may be delayed and peculiar due to a lack of insight into minds, and the resulting 
inability to enter into normal ostensive-inferential communication. This is a long- 
range developmental effect. In theory, then, the effects of a deficit in mentalizing 
ability early in development might remain (as do the effects of, e.g., early visual 
deprivation), even when theory of mind is gained later on and can then be used 
moment to moment. 
38-6. RELATIONSHIP OF LANGUAGE 
TO THEORY OF MIND 
To date there is no evidence against the idea that all individuals with autism suffer at 
least a delay in developing the ability to represent mental states. However, in some 
this ability does seem to emerge eventually, typically in adolescence. These individ- 
uals, often diagnosed as having Asperger syndrome, show more insightful commu- 
nication and socialization in their everyday lives (Happ6, 1994). People with autism 
who pass theory of mind tests also tend to be more verbally able than those who fail. 
Interestingly, individuals with autism appear to require a much higher verbal mental 
age in order to pass theory of mind tests than do either normal or mentally handi- 
capped individuals (Happ6, 1995). Language may play a different role in theory of 
mind test performance for autistic and control individuals; verbal mental age is highly 
correlated with mentalizing performance in autism, but not in other mentally handi- 
capped groups. 
It is not that autistic people who fail theory of mind tests do so due to lack of 
verbal comprehension (after all, they pass control questions)mrather, in order to pass 
theory of mind tests, individuals with autism may be relying on advanced language 
skills. Could it be that language somehow allows the autistic child to circumvent his/ 
her theory of mind impairmentmthat language can become an artificial route to the 
representation of mental states? Tager-Flusberg and Sullivan (1994) have suggested 
that some individuals with autism use their competence with complex embedded syn- 
tactic forms (e.g., sentential complements) to develop an understanding of the em- 
bedded nature of propositions in mental states. 
38-7. ASPERGER'S SYNDROME 
Exploration of the links between better language and better social understanding 
(based on mentalizing) brings us naturally to focus on Asperger's syndrome. Although 

38 
Language and Communication in Autism 
533 
this new label is still somewhat controversial, what is generally agreed is that it applies 
to those individuals on the autistic spectrum who have rather better social and com- 
munication skills. Recent research has suggested that people diagnosed as having 
Asperger's syndrome do not show the striking failure on theory of mind tasks typical 
of other autistic individuals (Ozonoff et al., 1991). Participants in these studies are 
typically adolescents, with near-normal IQ. Their good performance on laboratory tests 
suggests that theory of mind is working for them at that momentmat least in these 
simple structured tasks. These individuals are still impaired in everyday life, however, 
and show the characteristic restricted interests and odd stereotypes. It remains to be 
seen whether their mentalizing mechanism was functioning earlier in development. It 
is possible that these people have deficits due to early impairments in theory of mind 
that have irreversibly affected the developmental course. 
One way to find out whether individuals with Asperger's syndrome have early 
deficits in theory of mind is by exploring their acquisition of language. Language 
development, and specifically lexical acquisition, may be a barometer of early sensi- 
tivity to mental states (orientation to ostension, recognition of attentional focus, etc.). 
Therefore, a strong prediction would be that children with deficits in these early theory 
of mind functions will have abnormal word learning. By contrast, a child with ab- 
solutely normal acquisition of words through ostension (pointing and naming), and 
an absence of mapping errors, would have to be credited with a normally functioning 
theory of mind mechanism. Interestingly, among children with autistic disorders, the 
development of some communicative speech by age 5 is a marker for a good prognosis 
and, apart from IQ, language features appear to provide the best predictors of psy- 
chosocial outcome (Frith, 1989b). 
Somewhat controversially, the new diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome 
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994) distinguish this disorder from other forms 
of autism by specifying that there must be no significant language or cognitive delay. 
As yet there have been no follow-up studies to demonstrate that language delay is the 
important discriminating factor. However, in terms of the theory proposed in this 
chapter, it would clearly be interesting if some children on the autism spectrum (those 
fitting the Asperger picture) were not subject to the typical autistic language delay 
and abnormality. Indeed, it would suggest that for these individuals theory of mind 
is intact even early in lifemand hence a different explanation for the triad of impair- 
ments would be needed. Looking at early language history, then, may aid us in iden- 
tifying cognitively distinct subtypes within the autism spectrum, and may have pre- 
dictive value for many other areas of functioning. 
38-8. CONCLUSIONS 
AND FUTURE 
OUTLOOK 
The case of autism reminds us vividly that language and communication are distinct 
domains. Communication appears to be intimately intertwined with our human ability 
to attribute mental states to ourselves and others. In contrast, language (syntax and 
phonology) is a self-contained module that can be intact even though the ability to 
think about thoughts is impaired. Autism reminds us, also, that development is a 

534 
Francesca Happ~ 
complex process of interaction. Even a child with intact language abilities may have 
problems acquiring the agreed names for things in the normal socially mediated man- 
ner. On the one hand, normal language acquisition appears to rely importantly on the 
existence of communication; on the other hand, communication (including to the self) 
is well served by an external, flexible, abstractly mapped code such as speech. As- 
perger's syndrome promises to be an important and informative subgroup for future 
research on the relationship between language development and theory of mind. Re- 
cent advances in early diagnosis (Baron-Cohen et al., 1992), and the recognition of a 
genetic component in autism, render possible large-scale prospective studies of the 
development of language, communication, and social understanding in autism and 
Asperger's syndrome. Through studying these disorders, we may gain a better under- 
standing of the role of normal "mind reading" in language acquisition and everyday 
communication.

CHAPTER 39 
Spontaneous Recovery from Aphasia 
Stefano F. Cappa 
Laboratorio di Neuropsicologia, Universit~ di Brescia, Brescia, and Dipartimento di Scienze Cognitive, 
Scientific Institute H S. Raffaele, Milan, Italy 
Studies of spontaneous recovery from aphasia indicate that only a limited set of 
variables (severity, lesion size, time post-onset) have proven to be reliable prog- 
nostic factors, while others, such as age, gender, or handedness, have a less pre- 
dictable relationship with clinical outcome. Limited evidence is available about 
the possible role of other potentially relevant patients characteristics (education, 
language background, motivational and intellectual level). The neurological 
mechanisms underlying functional recovery are still largely unknown. Evidence 
from cerebral blood flow and metabolism studies indicates that regression of 
distance effects (diaschisis) in areas undamaged by the lesion may underlie re- 
cuperation in the first few months after an acute stroke. Takeover of selective 
aspects of language function by the healthy hemisphere may be the most relevant 
mechanism underlying recovery in later stages. 
Disorders of neurological function due to an acute, nonprogressive pathological in- 
volvement of the nervous system (as in the case of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, 
or trauma due to physical agents), if not extreme in severity, undergo a variable degree 
of recuperation in the period following injury. 
A preliminary problem for the scientific investigation of functional recovery lies 
in the definitions used to define the consequences of disease. The widely used World

Health Organization classification (World Health Organization, 1980) underlines the 
distinction between impairment, disability, and handicap. In order to apply this ter- 
minology to aphasic disorders, we refer, respectively, to the direct consequence of the 
lesion on a measurable linguistic function (such as, for example, auditory compre- 
hension of single words and sentences), to its functional consequences (in this case 
the inability to engage in useful communicative exchanges), and to the final social 
outcome (loss of job, social isolation). Recovery can be assessed in relation to tem- 
poral modifications of each of these three aspects, which do not necessarily proceed 
in parallel. 
Most studies of recovery in aphasia have addressed the "impairment" level. This 
is hardly surprising, considering that the usual end point of recovery studies is the 
scores on aphasia tests, which, with few exceptions, yield profiles of linguistic im- 
pairment. This point should be kept in mind, because, at the clinical level, what of 
course matters for the individual patient is the recovery from disability and the pre- 
vention of the handicap. 
Another general problem is what can be considered as "spontaneous" and as 
"treatment induced" recovery. There is probably no such thing as spontaneous re- 
covery: the patient is always engaged in some form of "treatment," which can vary 
from totally aspecific, to highly specialized. In this chapter, "spontaneous" is used in 
a very broad sense: although some of the studies that are referred to have tried to 
assess the role of therapeutic intervention, the problem of the efficacy of specific forms 
of rehabilitation will not be discussed here. 
39-1. CLINICAL STUDIES OF 
SPONTANEOUS RECOVERY 
Several studies of recovery from aphasia due to vascular lesions are available in the 
neurological literature. Some of them have been guided by the clinical necessity to 
formulate a prognosis for the individual patient, and to provide a baseline for the 
evaluation of treatment effects. These investigations are extremely heterogeneous. 
Most of the studies are population-based, and the general statistical framework is 
correlational or regression analysis. The size and the characteristics of the sample vary 
widely, however, from small groups of selected patients (Nicholas, Helm-Eastabrooks, 
Ward-Lonergan, & Morgan, 1993) to large consecutive series (Pedersen, Joergensen, 
Nakayama, Raaschou, & Skyhoj Olsen, 1995); the methods of assessment of aphasia 
range from clinical scales (Pedersen et al., 1995) to standardized aphasia tests 
(Pickersgill & Lincoln, 1983); the number of independent variables that are entered 
into the outcome analysis also varies, and is not always appropriate to sample size. 
This classical epidemiological approach has been supplemented, in recent years, 
by detailed longitudinal studies of single cases, which make use of the tools of cog- 
nitive neurolinguistics (see, for example, Simmons & Buckingham, 1992; Trojano, 
Balbi, Russo, & Elefante, 1994). This distinct approach is another important source 
of information about language recovery. 

39 
Spontaneous Recovery 
537 
The following, selective discussion of the variables affecting recovery is organized 
according to the usual practice of clinical medicine, subdividing the variables into 
patient-related and disease-related variables. Most of the evidence has been reviewed 
in detail by Basso (1992) to which the reader is referred for a complete bibliography. 
39-1.1. Patient-Related Variables 
39-1.1.1. Age 
Increasing age is associated with inferior recovery in some (Marshall, Thompkins, & 
Phillips, 1982) but not in all studies (Basso, Capitani, & Vignolo, 1979). For example, 
a large-scale study by Pedersen et al. (1995) found a "minimal" effect of age on 
recovery at 6 months. It must be remarked that age is associated with a number of 
phenomena that might play a detrimental role on recovery: in particular, many age- 
associated medical and neurological diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and de- 
menting conditions, can affect the brain, and thus interfere with the neurological modi- 
fications associated with functional recovery (comorbidity). When these considerations 
are kept in mind, what can be concluded from the available evidence is that old age 
per se does not appear to be a major negative prognostic factor for aphasia recovery. 
This is a point worth considering, given that economical constraints in the provision 
of rehabilitation services in most countries tend to penalize older patients. 
On the other hand, the effect of age on recovery is unequivocal in the case of 
childhood aphasia: a fast and relatively complete recovery can be expected in children 
with acquired aphasia (Martins, Castro-Caldas, Van Dongen, & Van Hout, 1991); 
moreover, within this population there is a trend for a better prognosis being associated 
with earlier lesion onset (Martins & Ferro, 1992). 
39-1.1.2. Gender 
The subtle gender-related differences observed in neuropsychological performance 
have been suggested to indicate different patterns of cerebral organization, possibly 
related to the effects of sexual hormones on neural differentiation (Fitch & Denenberg, 
1995). The idea of a different, less lateralized pattern of hemispheric specialization in 
females (McGlone, 1977), which has received some support by a recent functional 
imaging study (Shaywitz et al., 1995), has led to the prediction of better recovery in 
females. Some empirical support has been obtained for this hypothesis (Basso, 
Capitani, & Moraschini, 1982; Pizzamiglio, Mammucari, & Razzano, 1985), although 
the evidence remains limited and controversial. 
39-1.1.3. Education 
Education has usually not been included in prognostic analyses. Clinical experience 
suggests that education does indeed play a role, but it is unclear if the positive effects 
of a higher cultural level are independent from those of other potentially related var- 
iables, such as socioeconomic status and general intelligence (no effects of IQ on 

538 
Stefano F. Cappa 
recovery were found, however, by David & Skilbeck, 1984). Given that studies of 
aphasia in illiterates have suggested that the acquisition of reading skills modulates 
the clinical picture of aphasia (Lecours, 1989), an effect on the pattern of recovery 
could also be expected. 
39-1.1.4. Linguistic Background 
Several interesting observations have been reported about differential recovery in pa- 
tients who know more than one language. No clear-cut pattern emerges from the 
literature; in particular, the idea that the first acquired language recovers first has been 
challenged by several observations (Aglioti & Fabbro, 1993; Paradis, this volume). 
39-1.1.5. Handedness 
The main sources of evidence for an effect of handedness on recovery from aphasia 
have been studies in left-handed patients (Basso, Farabola, Grassi, Laiacona, & Zan- 
obio, 1990) and in patients with "atypical" hemispheric language dominance, such 
as "crossed" aphasics (Basso, Capitani, Laiacona, & Zanobio, 1985). Both these con- 
ditions have been associated with better, or faster, recovery. However, superior recov- 
ery does not seem to be the rule in all crossed aphasics (see Table 1). 
The in-depth analysis of patterns of recovery in these patients with "atypical" 
language lateralization (crossed right-handed aphasics and left-handers, with both 
crossed and uncrossed aphasias) might provide important clues about the cerebral 
organization of linguistic functions. These patients often show unusual dissociations 
of linguistic performance, which can be associated with specific patterns of recovery 
(Berndt, Mitchum, & Price, 1991; Trojano et al., 1994). 
39-1.1.6. Hemispheric Asymmetries 
This anatomical variable, as assessed in vivo on the basis of CT- or MRI-detected 
asymmetries, is related to handedness (Steinmetz, Volkmann, JS.nke, & Freund, 1991) 
and language lateralization (Foundas, Leonard, Gilmore, Fennel, & Heilman, 1994).

expected in noncrossed aphasics (i.e., right-handers with left-hemispheric lesions) with lesions 
of comparable site and extent. From Basso et al., 1985; Cappa et al., 1993; Perani, Papagno, 
Cappa, Gerundini, & Fazio, 1988. 

39 
Spontaneous Recovery 
539 
Some studies have suggested a role of hemispheric asymmetries in predicting outcome. 
The original observation of better recovery in global aphasics with "atypical" hemi- 
spheric asymmetry (i.e., right temporal wider than left) has not been confirmed in 
other studies; in particular, Burke, Yeo, Delaney, and Conner (1993) have reported 
the reverse association. 
39-1.1.7. Motivational and Social Factors 
Despite their obvious clinical significance, these aspects have been largely neglected. 
There is evidence that depression, which may be particularly severe in patients with 
anterior lesions, interacts negatively with recovery (Robinson, Starr, & Price, 1984). 
39-1.2. Disease-Related Variables 
39-1.2.1. Etiology 
It is obvious that the main negative prognostic factor for aphasia is a nonstatic eti- 
ology, that is, its association with a progressive disease of the nervous system, such 
as a malignant tumor or a degenerative condition. Leaving these general considerations 
aside, there is evidence that aphasia due to traumatic brain injury recovers better than 
aphasia due to cerebrovascular lesion (Basso & Scarpa, 1990); this effect may be 
dependent, however, on the younger age of the patients and on the generally milder 
clinical picture. Concerning aphasia due to vascular lesions, hemorrhagic strokes tend 
to be associated with a more severe clinical picture, but with better outcome in com- 
parison with ischemic strokes (Basso, 1992; Nicholas et al., 1993); this may be re- 
lated to the less destructive effects of a hematoma on brain tissue, and/or to the less 
frequent presence of diffuse ischemic changes in the brain of patients with hemor- 
rhagic stroke. 
39-1.2.2. Lesion Size 
Many studies performed after the introduction of CT scan have assessed the size of 
vascular lesions in aphasic patients. The size of the cerebral lesion, together with the 
closely associated variable of aphasia severity, seems to be the strongest negative 
predictor of recovery in all studies (for examples, see Goldenberg & Spatt, 1994; 
Mazzoni et al., 1992). 
39-1.2.3. Lesion Site 
The role of lesion site in determining recovery has of course attracted considerable 
interest, given the information it may give on the neural organization of language. 
Within this framework, the negative influence of a lesion localized to a specific cere- 
bral area on the recuperation of a definite aspect of language function has been taken 
to indicate a relevant functional contribution of that area. A remarkable series of 
papers by Knopman and his colleagues has addressed the question of the role of lesion 

540 
Stefano F. Cappa 
site on the recovery of several aspects of language function, such as speech flu- 
ency or auditory comprehension, as assessed by traditional language tests. Cortico- 
subcortical lesions of the left precentral gyrus were found in patients who remained 
nonfluent 6 months after onset (Knopman et al., 1983). Other investigations have 
suggested that the extension of the lesion toward the basal ganglia (Ludlow et al., 
1986) or mesial frontal white matter (Naeser, Palumbo, Helm-Eastabrooks, Stiassny- 
Eder, & Albert, 1989) is associated with a negative prognosis for fluency. Naming 
disorders persisted at 6 months only in patients with lesions of the posterior tempo- 
roparietal and insulo-lenticular region (Knopman, Selnes, Niccum, & Rubens, 1984), 
while repetition disorders were long-lasting in the case of lesions involving Wernicke's 
area (Selnes, Knopman, Niccum, & Rubens, 1985). The recovery of single-word com- 
prehension disorders was related only to lesion size (Selnes, Niccum, Knopman, & 
Rubens, 1984), while the lesion extent in Wernicke's area and suprasylvian parietal 
regions predicted the recovery of sentence comprehension (Selnes, Knopman, Niccum, 
& Rubens, 1983). Subsequent studies have addressed this point. According to Naeser 
and colleagues (Naeser, Helm-Eastabrooks, Haas, Auerbach, & Srinivasan, 1987), only 
the lesion extent in the temporal lobe correlated with severity and recovery of com- 
prehension disorder. A different finding has been reported by Kertesz, Lau, and Polk 
(1993): in their study, it was lesion extent in the inferior parietal area (supramarginal 
and angular gyrus) that predicted comprehension recovery. In an investigation of 
global aphasia, patients were more likely to recover auditory comprehension if the 
lesion were centered on the temporal isthmus, rather than on Wernicke's area (Naeser, 
Gaddie, Palumbo, & Stiassny-Eder, 1990). 
Aphasias associated with subcortical lesions are associated often, but not invariably, 
with a fast and complete recovery (Vallar et al., 1988), leaving the patients only with 
a mild residual semantic-lexical disorder (Kennedy & Murdoch, 1993). 
It has been suggested that pathological involvement of the temporobasal regions 
has a negative effect on rehabilitation-induced, but not on spontaneous, recovery 
(Goldenberg & Spatt, 1994); this interesting finding deserves replication in a larger 
patient sample. 
39-1.2.4. Clinical Picture 
Several studies have addressed the question of the relationship of aphasic syndromes, 
according to the traditional taxonomy, with recovery. The results are clearly con- 
founded by severity effects, as some syndromes, such as global aphasia, are intrinsi- 
cally more severe than others. Moreover, the assignment of a patient to a taxonomic 
category is based on a cluster of symptoms defined in terms of performance in dif- 
ferent language modalities (typically, oral expression, auditory comprehension, and 
repetition). This approach is not suitable for the acute stage, when the patients differ 
mainly along the severity dimension (Wallesch, Bak, & Schulte-M6nting, 1992). Dif- 
ferences in the rate of recovery for different aspects of linguistic function further 
complicate the effort to assess the influence of aphasia type: auditory comprehension 
usually recovers first (Vignolo, 1964), followed by oral expression and written 

39 
Spontaneous Recovery 
541 
language. This means that many patients evolve from one clinical syndrome to another 
in the acute period (Pashek & Holland, 1988). 
All studies concur in indicating that initial severity, defined according to global 
impairment measures, appears to be the strongest predictor of recovery (Goldenberg 
& Spatt, 1994; Mazzoni et al., 1992; Pedersen et al., 1995). 
39-1.2.5. Time Post-Onset 
The rate of spontaneous recovery is maximal in the first 6 months after stroke, with 
a very steep curve in the first 6 weeks (Pedersen et al., 1995; Wade, Hewer, David, 
& Enderby, 1986). This finding, which is typically derived from population studies 
on an unselected patient sample using very broad assessment procedures, must not 
obscure the relevant fact that significant improvement can be observed in severely 
aphasic patients up to 2 years post-onset (Hanson, Metter, & Riege, 1989; Nicholas 
et al., 1993). 
To summarize, there is unequivocal evidence that clinical severity, lesion size, and 
time post-onset are negative prognostic factors. Lesion site has predictive value for 
specific aspects of linguistic recovery. The role of other variables, such as gender, 
age, handedness, and linguistic background, deserves further investigation. 
39-2. THE NEUROLOGICAL 
BASIS OF RECOVERY 
The mechanisms underlying recovery of aphasia (and of neurological impairment in 
general) remain largely unknown. 
An amelioration of communicative abilities can sometimes be wholly accounted 
for at the behavioral level, as the consequence of "strategic" reorganization, both 
spontaneous and induced by specific training. However, recovery of basic aspects of 
linguistic impairment, such as disorders of phonemic discrimination or of lexical de- 
cision, suggests that modifications take place not only at the behavioral, but also at 
the neural, level. From this point of view, there appear to be substantial differences 
between aphasia and other neuropsychological syndromes. In the case of amnesia, for 
example, most signs of recovery can be expected at the functional level, through the 
use of memory aids and other "substitution" approaches, while measures of memory 
impairment, such as the free recall of word lists, are usually very resistant to treatment 
(Wilson, 1987). 
It is well known that the central nervous system has a limited potential for regen- 
eration: damaged axons of mature neurons fail to show spontaneous regrowth, unless 
they are presented with peripheral nerve grafts (for a comprehensive introduction to 
the neurobiology of recovery, see Kolb, 1995). The increasing body of knowledge 
about neurobiological mechanisms of recovery at the synaptic and cellular level is 
still far from providing an explanation for functional recuperation of complex func- 
tions, such as language. Two hypotheses have been advanced at the macroscopic level 
of brain organization: 

542 
Stefano F. Cappa 
. 
Regression of diaschisis: In the early period following an acute brain lesion, a 
functional impairment is present in structurally unaffected brain regions 
connected to the damaged area, both in the ipsilateral and in the contralateral 
hemisphere. This phenomenon is often called diaschisis, following von 
Monakow (1914) (for a discussion of the diaschisis concept, see Feeney & 
Baron, 1986). 
"Takeover" of function: In the case of a lateralized disorder such as aphasia, 
this takes the form of the hypothesis, originally formulated by Gowers (1895), 
of a takeover of linguistic functions by the contralateral, undamaged 
hemisphere (right-hemisphere theory of recovery). Within a Jacksonian 
framework (York & Steinberg, 1995), this is often considered as an 
"unmasking" of a preexisting functional commitment, inhibited by the left 
hemisphere (Moscovitch, 1977). Another possibility is that the reorganization 
of function takes place in undamaged areas within the same hemisphere. 
Much of the empirical evidence for these two hypotheses has been reviewed (Cappa 
& Vallar, 1992), and will be briefly summarized and updated here. 
39-2.1. Regression of Diaschisis 
The presence of diaschisis has been related to the severity of the clinical picture in 
the acute period after a stroke. A regression of diaschisis is usually, although not 
invariably, found in the following months; this finding may be related to the clinical 
recovery that is observed in the early period after a stroke. Knopman et al. (1984), 
using the Xe-133 method for the measurement of cerebral blood flow, found a "re- 
activation" of left temporoparietal areas in patients with good recovery of auditory 
comprehension. In a study with single photon emission computerized tomography 
(SPECT) of patients with aphasia or neglect after a stroke involving the subcortical 
areas, the regression of hypoperfusion in the ipsilesional, structurally unaffected cor- 
tical areas has been found to parallel the recovery of neuropsychological disorders 
(Vallar et al., 1988). 
Related mechanisms seem to be at work also in patients with aphasia due to cortical 
lesions. In a series of studies devoted to the assessment of regional cerebral metabolic 
abnormalities in structurally affected and unaffected brain areas in aphasic patients, 
Metter and coworkers (Metter, Jackson, Kempler, & Hanson, 1992) found a significant 
positive correlation between changes of left and right temporoparietal glucose metab- 
olism and the change in the auditory comprehension score of the Western Aphasia 
Battery. Heiss and coworkers (Heiss, Kessler, Karbe, Fink, & Pawlik, 1993) found 
that the value of left-hemispheric glucose metabolism outside the infarcted area in the 
acute stage after left-hemispheric lesion was the best predictor of recovery of auditory 
comprehension measured on Token test scores after 4 months, suggesting an important 
role of intrahemispheric diaschisis in determining the severity of the clinical picture 
in the acute stage and its recovery. The day following the first examination, a sub- 
sample of patients with mild aphasia was submitted to a second PET examination 

39 
Spontaneous Recovery 
543 
with (lSF) FDG in what the authors considered as an "activated" state, that is, while 
they were engaged in an open conversation. The metabolic values in the "infarcted" 
region, in its contralateral mirror area, and in left Broca's area during activation were 
highly predictive of the recovery of auditory comprehension, indicating that the pos- 
sibility of activating an extensive, bihemispheric neural network was crucial for re- 
covery. A further study (Karbe, Kessler, Herholz, Fink, & Heiss, 1995) indicated that 
at a 2-year follow-up the post-stroke metabolic rates of language-relevant regions (left 
superior temporal and left prefrontal cortex) were still the best predictors of language 
comprehension and word fluency, respectively. 
In a recent study, using quantitative assessment of regional glucose metabolism 
with positron emission tomography (PET), Cappa et al. (1997) looked for a similar 
phenomenon (regression of functional deactivation in brain regions remote but con- 
nected to the primarily injured areas) in patients with aphasia due to lesions of the 
cortical language areas. The study focused on the early period after an acute stroke 
involving the cerebral cortex of the left hemisphere; only patients with lesions of 
limited size and mild aphasia, where significant spontaneous recovery can be expected, 
were included. The patients were studied for the first time 2 weeks after the stroke, 
that is, when the clinical picture of aphasia can be considered "stable." The follow- 
up study was performed 6 months later, when extensive recovery can be expected in 
this patient group. This study confirmed the presence of extensive metabolic depres- 
sion in structurally unaffected areas in patients with acute stroke. The reduction in 
glucose metabolism was not limited to the ipsilateral hemisphere, but extended con- 
tralaterally. An association was found between regression of functional deactivation 
in structurally intact regions connected with the area of anatomical damage and spon- 
taneous recovery in the first 3 months after a stroke. 
Taken together, these findings suggest that the regression of intrahemispheric and 
transhemispheric diaschisis may be associated with the recovery of a function, such 
as language, that is subserved by an extensive network of interconnected regions in 
both hemispheres, at least in the first 6 months.after stroke. 
39-2.2. Functional Takeover 
Several case studies of patients with bilateral lesions have reported the worsening of 
language function in a recovered patient after a second stroke in the right hemisphere 
(for a recent example, see Cappa, Miozzo, & Frugoni, 1994); these observations con- 
cur with the results of pharmacological inactivation of the right hemisphere in aphasics 
(Kinsbourne, 1971), and suggest a role of the right hemisphere in mediating residual 
or recovered linguistic performance (see also Kinsbourne, this volume). This hypoth- 
esis has been supported by the results of some noninvasive studies of hemispheric 
language dominance in aphasics. Most dichotic listening studies have shown a re- 
versed ear advantage for linguistic stimuli (i.e., superiority of the left ear). This find- 
ing, however, cannot be univocally interpreted as the result of a reversal of language 
dominance. The presence of a lesion in the left hemisphere can be expected to interfere 
by itself with right-ear superiority if it involves the auditory cortex (Niccum & Speaks, 

544 
Stefano F. Cappa 
1991). The interpretation of the results of divided visual field studies is hampered by 
the same problem, that is, lesion effects. Neurophysiological studies, using the re- 
cording of evoked responses to linguistic stimuli, have shown a reversed asymmetry 
in the amplitude of the responses in recovered aphasics (Papanicolaou, Moore, 
Deutsch, Levin, & Eisenberg, 1988). 
The measurement of regional cerebral blood flow in aphasics using the xenon-133 
method (Demeurisse & Capon, 1987) has also provided evidence of an increased right- 
hemispheric contribution (Demeurisse & Capon, 1991). The investigation of regional 
cerebral activations in recovered and nonrecovered aphasic patients, studied with PET 
while engaged in linguistic tasks, allows a more direct investigation of the functional 
reorganization of the brain after acute damage. Activation methods have been applied 
to the study of recovery of motor function after striatocapsular ischemic lesions 
(Chollet et al., 1991; Weiller, Chollet, Friston, Wise, & Frackowiak, 1992). An exten- 
sive functional reorganization, including both ipsilateral and contralateral regions, has 
been observed in recovered patients performing a motor task. Several methodological 
problems, which only recently have been superseded by technical developments, and 
which are associated in particular with the necessity to perform group studies, have 
hampered the application of language activation paradigms to the study of aphasia. 
An example of this approach is a report by Weiller et al. (1995) concerning a group 
of partially recovered Wernicke's aphasics studied with PET while engaged in two 
linguistic tasks: nonword repetition and verb generation. The results of this study 
indicate a significant recruitment of frontal and temporal areas in the right hemisphere, 
mirroring the left-hemispheric areas that were activated in control subjects. Buckner, 
Corbetta, Schatz, Raichle, & Petersen (1996) reported a PET activation study in an 
aphasic patient with a left inferior frontal infarction. During a word-stem completion 
task, he showed a right lateralized instead of a left lateralized prefrontal response, 
suggesting recruitment of a compensatory brain pathway. A recent transcranial Dopp- 
ler study (Silvestrini, Troisi, Matteis, Cupini, & Caltagirone, 1995) provides further 
evidence for the contribution of the right hemisphere to the word-fluency task in 
recovered aphasics. 
However, there is evidence that some aspects of language function do not migrate 
to the opposite hemisphere. For example, Vallar and colleagues (1988) used an inter- 
ference task (articulation in normal subjects interferes with visual reaction time per- 
formance only when the stimuli are presented in the right hemispace, that is, to the 
left hemisphere). Recovered aphasic subjects showed the same effect as normal con- 
trols, suggesting that the left hemisphere was still in charge for articulatory program- 
ming. Similarly, the normal right-sided asymmetry in mouth opening during speech 
has been shown to be preserved in most aphasic patients (Graves & Landis, 1985). 
39-3. CONCLUSIONS 
In conclusion, there is considerable evidence that both intrahemispheric and interhem- 
ispheric reorganization play a role in the recovery process. It may be hypothesized 
that in the first months after a stroke, when the recovery proceeds at a fast rate, the 

39 
Spontaneous Recovery 
545 
regression of functional depression in ipsi- and controlateral areas is the main mech- 
anism underlying recovery. At the clinical level, this period is usually associated with 
a prevalent improvement of auditory comprehension. The subsequent phase, charac- 
terized by a much less steep recovery function, might be related to the process of 
functional reorganization; the relative contribution of undamaged regions of the left 
hemisphere and of the healthy right hemisphere remains to be assessed. For example, 
the available evidence suggests that different aspects of expressive function may be 
subserved by a specific pattern of reorganization: a contribution of the healthy hemi- 
sphere is probable for lexical retrieval, while speech programming aspects seem to 
remain strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere. 
Knowledge about spontaneous recovery and its underlying biological mechanisms 
provides the foundations for the study of therapeutic intervention. A relatively large 
amount of data is available about the natural history of aphasia and the influence of 
several variables on its course; what is still missing is an understanding of its neu- 
rological underpinnings. PET appears to be a promising tool of investigation, address- 
ing the crucial issues of cerebral plasticity and reorganization of function. There are 
several clinically relevant aspects of the recovery process that have never been in- 
vestigated, and that deserve particular attention. For example, there is now sufficient 
evidence that rehabilitation has a positive effect on recovery: specific predictions about 
the neurological correlates of different treatment methods can now be put to test using 
functional imaging. Another important aspect is the effect of drugs, and their possible 
interaction with behavioral methods. The time is ripe for more precise studies, based 
on linguistically and neurologically grounded hypotheses, taking advantage of the po- 
tentials offered by the current advancement of functionally imaging methods, such as 
3-D data collection with PET, which allows single-subject studies, and functional MRI.

Improvements are often considered the result of 
spontaneous" recovery, fol- 
lowed by changes due to language treatment. Recent neurobiological findings 
show that the mechanisms underlying brain reorganizations after injury are also 
involved in normal learning processes. Language relearning and neuroplasticity 
work in concert to modify brain organization over considerably longer periods 
of time than is often assumed. The appreciation of this symbiosis between lan- 
guage and brain repair may enrich recent developments in rehabilitation re- 
search. It is argued that longitudinal studies of structured learning paradigms 
combined with simultaneous drug treatments are needed to study and remediate 
the restitution and substitution of language functions. 
Brains can recover from injury. Patients can recover from language and communi- 
cation disorders. How might the two be related?

Aphasia rehabilitation methods often formulate the goals of treatment in terms of 
restoration or substitution (Holland & Forbes, 1993; M6the, Huber, & Paradis, 1993) 
implying that treatment ultimately results in some specific neurobiological changes. 
However, brain repair theories are rarely included in models of rehabilitation (but see 
Holland, 1989; Weniger & Sarno, 1990). Is there anything to learn from the way 
language experience interacts with a reorganizing and learning brain? Recent findings 
in neuroscience about the mechanisms underlying brain repair and learning and mem- 
ory do not leave much doubt about the answer. Aphasia treatment constitutes a learn- 
ing situation and learning does change the brain, especially a brain that is energetically 
trying to cope with and repair the results of injury. 
These developments in the neurobiology of recovery are paralleled by hotly debated 
new developments in the rehabilitation of language disorders; see the special journal 
issues Aphasiology, 1994, 8(5); Brain and Language, 1996, 52(1); European Journal 
of Disorders of Communication, 1995, 30(3); Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 
1995, 5(1-2). As the debate centers around the cognitive neuropsychological approach 
to rehabilitation, it seems appropriate to start the quest about language and brain 
interactions by investigating the contributions of this approach to an understanding of 
recovery from language and communication disorders. 
40-1. THE 
COGNITIVE 
NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL 
APPROACH TO RECOVERY 
The development of cognitive neuropsychological approaches to rehabilitation (Seron 
& Deloche, 1989; Humphreys & Riddoch, 1994) has first and for all led to theory- 
guided deficit interpretations. 
Model-driven cognitive neuropsychological treatment is focused on "fixing" im- 
pairments that are interpreted to reflect specific defects in processing models. The 
problems inherent in handling a cognitive theory of normal processing as a theory of 
cognitive rehabilitation have been sufficiently discussed elsewhere (e.g., Basso, 1989; 
Caramazza, 1989; Wilson & Patterson, 1990; Holland, 1994; Mitchum & Berndt, 
1995). The blurring of the distinction between the explanation and treatment of lan- 
guage disorders (e.g., Howard & Hatfield, 1987; Lesser & Milroy, 1993) and the 
subsequent disappearance of the distinction between deficit assessment and treatment 
methods and goals (Edmundson & McIntosh, 1995) seems to set a natural limit to 
this purely model-driven rehabilitation approach. 
Other cognitive rehabilitation methods try to account for the fact that models of 
normal language processing are still clearly underspecified and that patients show 
heterogeneous deficit patterns, by developing focused and explicit intervention meth- 
odologies. For example, Schwarz, Fink, and Saffran (1995) propose a modular ap- 
proach, consisting of component skill treatments sensitive to different causes for 
specific aphasic symptoms. Springer and Willmes (1993) are among the few who 
explicitly emphasize the learning component in treatment procedures and advocate 
the use of crossover designs to compare the effects of different structured learning 

40 
Brain and Rehabilitation 
549 
paradigms within patients. It is noteworthy that both approaches focus on symptom- 
specific small groups with special attention for individual differences. 
The emphasis on theory-guided assessments, explicit descriptions of materials 
(Weniger, Springer, & Poeck, 1987; Byng, 1995) and training methods (e.g. Springer 
& Willmes, 1993; Schwarz, Saffran, Fink, Myers, & Martin, 1994; Schlenck, 
Schlenck, & Springer, 1995), constitutes a methodologically critical ingredient for the 
study of language recovery after brain damage. However, it is evident that the effects 
of behavioral intervention on recovery processes are intimately related to brain 
changes. Unfortunately, cognitive neuropsychological approaches do not differ from 
most other rehabilitation approaches in that they sometimes acknowledge, but seldom 
address, the consequences of brain repair for language rehabilitation and the effects 
of language learning on brain function. This neglect contrasts sharply with the firm 
roots early aphasia rehabilitation had in neurobiological and learning theory (Schuell, 
Jenkins, & Jimenez-Pabon, 1964; Luria, Naydin, Tsvetkova, & Vinarskaya, 1969; 
Weigl, 1979). In the following I will explore the question of whether it is worthwhile 
to restore or to substitute these roots. 
40-2. RESTORATION AND SUBSTITUTION 
OF FUNCTION 
Concepts like restoration and substitution of function are not only central to neuro- 
biological theories of recovery after brain damage (e.g., Almli & Finger, 1988), but 
also to cognitive theories of recovery from language disorders. For example, Howard 
and Patterson (1989) described the improvements of three cases (patient P.S.: de Partz, 
1986; B.R.B.: Byng, 1988; B.B.: Jones, 1986) in terms of a psycholinguistic model 
of normal language processing. The fact that it was possible to fit these data in such 
a model constituted the sole reason to interpret this improvement as a restitution of 
the original function. Weniger and Bertoni (1993) challenged this restoration interpre- 
tation by pointing out that the improvements were linguistically limited and context- 
dependent. They interpreted the reported improvements as the learning of a strategy 
to adapt to a processing impairment and, therefore, as a partially successful substitu- 
tion for the original function. This example illustrates that one cannot distinguish 
between restitution and substitution of function without a careful analysis of what the 
patient actually did learn. Interpreting changes after training is at least as dependent 
on the availability of a theory of normal processing as it is on an analysis of learning 
paradigms and thus training methods: "A theory of remediation without a model of 
learning is a vehicle without an engine" (Baddeley, 1993b, p. 235). 
Neuroscience is confronted with questions of whether brain repair mechanisms are 
necessary for functional improvement to occur (Finger & Almli, 1985) and sufficient 
to sustain recovery (Stein, Brailowsky, & Will, 1995). Although the questions asked 
in neuroscience differ in content from questions in cognitive neuropsychology, both 
research areas nonetheless may profit from the same set of behavioral data. Longitu- 
dinal intervention studies with an emphasis on explicit learning paradigms are needed

to clarify the mechanisms involved in the restoration and substitution of function. 
Such studies will also naturally address the how-to-treat-what-and-when issue so 
prominent in aphasia rehabilitation. 
Before embarking on the relations between brain and language repair, relevant 
neurobiological concepts and mechanisms of recovery will be briefly introduced. 
40-3. NEUROPLASTICITY AND RECOVERY 
The main neurobiological mechanisms traditionally thought to mediate recovery were 
vicariation, redundancy, and diaschisis (for a critical review, see Finger, LeVere, Almli, 
& Stein, 1988). Vicariation is the idea that another area of the brain, not previously 
involved in a particular function, takes over the function of the damaged area. Re- 
dundancy assumes that uninjured neurons in the damaged area function as spare sys- 
tems that can compensate for those that are nonfunctional. Diaschisis asserts that brain 
injury to a certain area will inhibit connected noninjured areas and recovery consists 
of the removal of this inhibition and therefore of a return to normal function (see also 
Cappa, this volume). 
Experimental evidence for these theories is mainly negative or equivocal (Marshall, 
1985), and known neurobiological mechanisms of recovery do not relate to these 
theories (e.g., Slavin, Laurence, & Stein, 1988; Stein & Glazier, 1992). However, this 
critique does not appreciate that the effects of stroke (Zivin & Choi, 1991) deviate 
from the effects of experimental lesions. After all, long standing lowered metabolic 
rates in areas remote from the lesion site, predicted by diaschisis theory have been 
demonstrated (Metter, 1987). 
The traditional theories shared a common origin: they offered explanations for the 
reappearance of "lost" skills given a finite brain with rigidly localized functions. 
However, neuroscientists have established that a brain responds to damage by pro- 
ducing trophic factors and neuromodulators, stimulating regeneration processes and 
changing synaptic sensitivity. "This means that when damage occurs it triggers a 
complex cascade of processes that take place over potentially very long periods of 
time (days, weeks, months and perhaps even years) and produce changes throughout 
the entire nervous system which are not limited to the injury site alone" (Stein & 
Glazier, 1992, p. 8; my emphasis). The relative merits of these neuroplasticity mech- 
anisms for cognitive improvements after brain damage are still controversial (see also 
Section 7.3 in this chapter). However, the finding that the mechanisms underlying 
brain reorganizations are also involved in normal learning processes (e.g., Weinberger, 
1995; Kolb, 1995) indicates a strong relation between neuroplasticity and recovery. 
40-4. NEUROPLASTICITY AND LEARNING 
The brain "has the capacity for continuously changing its structure and ultimately its 
function, throughout a lifetime" (Kolb, 1995, p. 4) and thus allows us to adapt to 

40 
Brain and Rehabilitation 
551 
changes in our internal and external environments. Recent research revealed evidence 
for the functional reorganization of cortical representational maps not as a consequence 
of damage, but as a consequence of sensory stimulation (Jenkins, Merzenich, & 
Recanzone, 1990). Weinberger et al. (1990) have demonstrated the possibility of re- 
tuning representations in auditory cortex: changes in receptive field sizes could be 
attributed to an associative learning process. This plasticity of cortical representational 
maps as a consequence of learning has been replicated in different species and dif- 
ferent sensory modalities (Recanzone, Schreiner, & Merzenich, 1993; Kaas, 1995; 
Weinberger, 1995). Now that it has been shown that learning changes representational 
maps in primary sensory cortices, it would be surprising if representations of cognitive 
functions are not dramatically dynamic in nature and sensitive to learning experience. 
A complete understanding of these neuroplastic mechanisms is not necessary to 
appreciate that the concept of a continuously changing brain sensitive to behavioral 
manipulation poses serious challenges for core beliefs about the rehabilitation of cog- 
nitive impairments, and language and communication disorders in particular. 
40-5. LIMITS TO NEUROPLASTICITY 
AND RECOVERY 
Although representational changes due to neuroplasticity may occur at any time, it 
will come as no surprise that there are limits to recovery. The size and site of 
the lesion play a significant role in level of outcome (e.g., Mazzoni et al., 1992; 
Goldenberg & Spatt, 1994). Marshall (1985) estimated that 10-15% of the tissue of 
a given structure must be spared to allow at least some recovery to occur. 
An example of a limit to recovery is the globally impaired aphasic patient. The 
widely held belief that these patients have little chance to recover (e.g., Schuell et al., 
1964; Mark, Thomas, & Berndt, 1992) probably rests on the assumption that the 
damage to their brains is beyond repair. An accepted rule of thumbm".., the lower 
the level of performance at onset, the more limited the amount of recovery" (Basso, 
1992, p. 342)mis based on the results of large aphasia recovery studies (e.g. Kertesz 
& McCabe, 1977). However, it is likely that the use of standard aphasia batteries as 
well as limited follow-up periods have restricted the possibility of measuring recovery 
in globally impaired patients. For example, Sarno and Levita (1981) reported signif- 
icant functional communication improvement in seven out of seven globally aphasic 
patients, although none of them improved on standard neurolinguistic measures. A 
Dutch study followed first-time stroke patients with unilateral damage in the left hem- 
isphere over the first year post-onset (Blomert, 1994). It was shown that half of the 
76 patients who were initially very severely impaired on a measure of purely verbal 
communicative efficacy (ANELT: Blomert, Kean, Koster, & Schokker, 1994) did show 
improvements: 17% just significant, 28% good, and 9% excellent recovery. Most 
patients still improved significantly in the second half of the first year. Economic 
pressures on health-care systems may deprive such patients of access to researchers 
and therapists long before recovery starts to be measurable or even to have occurred.

40-6. NEUROCHEMICAL 
THRESHOLDS 
AND 
COGNITIVE 
PROCESSING 
LIMITATIONS 
Adequate cognitive functioning requires a relatively high level of neurochemical ca- 
pacity. Functional (metabolic) "lesions" may represent depressed levels of neurotrans- 
mitters and/or receptor populations and thus form the biological basis of many proc- 
essing limitations. Because the quality and quantity of receptor populations is a 
dynamic property, long-standing functional lesions may signal the potential restitution 
of impairments. 
Processing limitations may be a primary cause of impairments at central levels of 
ongoing language activity (Friederici, 1995). Linebarger, Schwartz, and Saffran (1983) 
showed that agrammatic patients were able to detect syntactic anomalies, but were 
not able to use this knowledge on-line to produce well-formed sentences. Broca's 
aphasic patients did detect syntactic violations in spoken language if sentences were 
simple, but not if they were complex (Haarman & Kolk, 1994). Martin, Dell, Saffran, 
and Schwartz (1994) studied a patient over a period of 6 years post-onset. His overall 
improvement in naming performance as well as change in error pattern was interpreted 
as a normalization of the decay time of activated lexical items. This demonstration of 
a restitution of function after long-standing specific processing limitations is as elegant 
as it is rare. Adequate lexical retrieval no doubt requires sufficient processing resources 
to occur. A restitution of processing capacity very likely indicates a change in neu- 
rochemical thresholds. This change may have been brought about indirectly, by brain 
reorganizations unrelated to the function under study, or more directly by specific 
behavioral and/or pharmacological treatments. 
Luria et al. (1969) were among the first to appreciate the dynamic nature of cog- 
nitive deficits. They used a combination of pharmacological and behavioral treatment 
for seemingly permanent disorders and showed significant behavioral improvements 
by boosting levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It was further reported that 
the drug effects were stronger if combined with behavioral training. This beneficial 
effect of drugs as potential adjuvants to behavioral treatment was recently confirmed 
in a study reporting significant improvements in chronic aphasic patients receiving 
systematic language training in combination with a "cognitive enhancer" such as 
piracetam (Huber, Willmes, Poeck, Van Vleymen, & Deberdt, 1997). 
The concept of biochemical thresholds for the recovery of different functions was 
investigated by Russell, Smith, Booth, Jenden, and Waite (1986). They injected into 
rodents a compound binding irreversibly to cholinergic receptors in the brain and 
reducing the receptor population to approximately 10% of its normal volume. The 
results showed that recovery, from an almost complete neurochemical lesion, occurred 
in a strict hierarchical and temporal order: physiological functions reappeared first and 
cognitive functions last. This hierarchical recovery matched the increase of a newly 
synthesized receptor population. Cognitive functions were observed only after the 
receptor population had reached 90% of its normal level. These studies indicate that 
biochemical thresholds and balances in damaged areas and their connections may 
constitute key concepts for understanding (a) cognitive processing impairments in the 

40 
Brain and Rehabilitation 
553 
absence of extensive structural damage, (b) improvements without extensive structural 
changes, and (c) late recovery phenomena. Training programs may sometimes not be 
successful because they inappropriately tax the available processing capacity. Phar- 
macological and/or stimulation treatment preceding structured training may suffi- 
ciently alter neurochemical activity levels to make improvements possible and enhance 
the learning process. It has recently been shown that it is possible to significantly 
improve verbal memory of aged adults, if the subjects were administered a drug, 
sensitive to memory encoding, prior to the learning task (Lynch et al., 1997). These 
drugs (ampakines) promote the induction of long-term potentiation (Staubli et al., 
1994) and thus change functional biochemical thresholds. The authors suggest that the 
drugs used may be particularly effective in the context of reduced memory processing. 
There probably is more potential for recovery than is often assumed in the field of 
cognitive rehabilitation. 
40-7. THE INTRICATE RELATION OF LANGUAGE 
REHABILITATION AND BRAIN REPAIR 
Let us now consider the relevance of some neurobiological research findings for re- 
covery and rehabilitation. 
40-7.1. "Spontaneous" Recovery versus Rehabilitation 
The following is a recurrent statement in studies of the efficacy of treatment: the 
patient was x months post-onset and therefore improvements cannot be attributed to 
"spontaneous" recovery. Kertesz (1993) discriminated two recovery stages. During 
the first stage, absorption of cellular debris and edema are paralleled by attempts to 
reestablish circulation. This period may take anywhere from a few days to a month. 
After this, a second phase dominated by brain repair mechanisms may continue for 
months, and even for years. The period of "spontaneous" recovery often referred to 
in aphasia rehabilitation research presumably coincides with the start of this second 
stage and is typically assumed to end after 3 to 6 months. This assumed limit is based 
on large-scale heterogeneous group studies using compound average scores over a 
range of language modalities and is contradicted by evidence from single-case long- 
term recovery studies (e.g., Schlenk & Springer, 1989). 
Theories of the neurobiology of recovery as well as learning and memory, cast 
serious doubt on a categorical separation of "spontaneous" recovery and rehabilitation 
effects: brain damage results in behavioral changes and these in turn produce changes 
in the brain. The patient under investigation may change by the mere act of being 
studied. "Spontaneous" recovery and (re)learning can only be separated at a concep- 
tual level. The actual outcome of recovery processes reflects changes within an inte- 
grated organism that are determined by structural, neurochemical, physiological, and 
behavioral interactions (Russell, 1992). 

554 
Leo Blomert 
40-7.2. The Time Course of Recovery 
The controversy over the time course of recovery is mainly due to considerable dif- 
ferences in assessment methods and patient selection criteria. Estimates range from a 
few weeks or until "the lesion stabilizes" (Delwaide & Young, 1992), to months 
(Basso, 1992) or even years (Sarno, 1991). It has also been observed that recovery 
from aphasia may start to occur after many years (Geschwind, 1974, 1985; Luria et 
al., 1969). 
A time course analysis of brain plasticity revealed the partial overlap of initial de- 
and regeneration processes; glial scar tissue is already forming when sprouting and 
reactive synaptogenesis have barely started (Cotman & Nieto-Sampedro, 1985). 
This illustrates that the different repair processes cannot be separated in time and 
that "there is no principle of neuronal organization that demands that functional re- 
covery occurs immediately or not at all" (Stein & Glazier, 1992, p. 15). Treatment in 
an early period of massive biological change in a complex system may be as crucial 
as in seemingly stable stages of recovery. There is convincing evidence that recovery 
often does not occur "spontaneously" or will not reach a functional optimum without 
appropriate behavioral and/or pharmacological treatment. Recovery of stable, long- 
standing deficits has been reported following specifically designed training for com- 
plex motor (Bach-y-Rita, 1990, 1992), visual-perceptual (Zihl & von Cramon, 1979), 
and syntactic production deficits (Jones, 1986; Springer, Willmes, & Haag, 1993). 
Success of intervention may be dependent on the time post-onset when the treatment 
was given, "windows of opportunity" (Kolb, 1995), but interactions between time 
course and type of intervention is still terra incognita. The potential for long-lasting 
as well as late recovery, sometimes only to be uncovered by rehabilitation, indicates 
that the results of treatment efficacy studies using "chronic" or "stable" patients may 
need a reinterpretation. 
40-7.3. Are Changes Always Improvements? 
The main problem that confronts neuroscientists is not if the brain changes after injury, 
but whether these reparations are beneficial or detrimental (Stein et al., 1995). A 
comparable problem faces aphasia rehabilitation. If a patient fails a given criterion 
after considerable training, it is not reasonable to conclude that nothing was learned. 
This is not a prominent issue in discussions about rehabilitation (but see Baddeley, 
1993b; Weniger & Bertoni, 1993; Holland, 1994; Byng & Black, 1995). The hidden 
premise in rehabilitation seems to be: if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt. This may be 
misleading. "It is likely that many changes, perhaps the majority, are unfavorable, serv- 
ing to prevent the expression of latent restorative processes. Studies of these unfavorable 
mechanisms may be even more important than investigation of spontaneous recovery in 
leading to improved methods of therapy" (Geschwind, 1985, p. 2). The large number of 
permanently impaired patients is advanced as evidence for these maladaptations. 
Brain repair mechanisms seem not quite prepared for the task set for them (Finger 
& Almli, 1985). The reason may be that potential recovery mechanisms have been 

40 
Brain and Rehabilitation 
5 55 
sacrificed in evolution to favor other specializations, as, for example, functional la- 
teralization instead of duplicate hemispheres. Inappropriate rewiring or synaptic re- 
organization could potentially be more detrimental than neuronal loss (Galaburda, 
1990). "Bad brain is far worse than no brain" (Kolb, 1992, p. 176). Cotman, 
Cummings, and Pike (1993) argue that a disruption of the balance between "adaptive 
and pathological plasticity" may in time prevent a restoration of function, especially 
in an aging brain subject to multiple injuries and compensations. Therefore, it seems 
reasonable to assume that incomplete recovery may result from the damage per se 
and/or the neurobiological maladaptations. Furthermore, since learning is one of the 
modulators of brain (re)organization, it is necessary to find out which training methods 
improve and which actually may prevent a restoration of function. An evaluation of 
changes over time may identify beneficial and pathological adaptations and controlled 
learning paradigms may clarify the impact of treatment at different times post-onset. 
Reporting null effects of treatment is, therefore, not only useful for the evaluation of 
method, but certainly contributes to the building of an integrated theory of recovery. 
40-8. CAN SYNTAX BE (RE)LEARNED? 
What constitutes restitution and what substitution in the process of relearning lan- 
guage? Insights may be gained from the study of language properties that need in- 
herent brain capacities to develop and thus possibly constrain the degree to which this 
property can be (re)learned. Syntactic proficiency requires an innate computational 
device and a critical period of exposure to spoken language. For example: children 
and adults deprived of early language experience never really mastered complex syn- 
tactic structures, such as wh-sentences (e.g., Pinker, 1994). Ludlow (1973) investigated 
when and how syntactic structures not essential for the production of simple declar- 
ative sentences would reappear in the speech of fluent and nonfluent aphasic patients. 
She showed that the order of recovery of the investigated structures did not differ 
between individuals or aphasic groups and mainly correlated with the frequency of 
occurrence of these structures in normal speech. Given these potential constraints on 
the degree to which syntax can be (re)learned, what are the mechanisms underlying 
syntactic improvements in severely agrammatic patients? 
It has been shown that agrammatic patients did not generate untrained wh-structures 
despite elaborate training consisting of isolated sentences (Thompson & McReynolds, 
1986). Thompson and Shapiro (1995) based their treatments on the assumption that 
the training of a given sentence type will generalize to sentences subject to similar 
syntactic rules and principles, supposedly using the same "mentalistic operations." If 
sentences similar in structure to the target picture/sentence were primed, enhanced use 
of these same structures was measured in restricted sentence production and discourse 
tasks. However, no generalizations across sentence types were observed. 
Springer et al. (1993) used a two-period crossover design combining a linguistically 
specific learning approach and a prosodic stimulation approach. Remarkable improve- 
ments in the use of wh-questions were observed in dyadic conversations. The linguistic 

556 
Leo Blomert 
learning approach was significantly more effective than the stimulation approach. In- 
terestingly, it was also found that prosodic stimulation followed by specific language 
training proved even more advantageous. The authors concluded that these improve- 
ments in chronic patients indicate that "it is not just deblocking of temporarily affected 
abilities but controlled (re)learning that takes place in linguistically oriented therapy." 
B lomert and de Roo (1995) analyzed the evolution of syntax in the first year post- 
stroke. Twenty-one patients were presented with the same standardized daily life sit- 
uations (ANELT: Blomert et al., 1994) 1 and 13 months post-onset. All patients re- 
ceived some form of therapy during the year, but nobody received specific syntactic 
training. The results showed a clear relation between initial and outcome level of 
syntactic complexity and well-formedness within patients, irrespective of aphasia type. 
These findings suggested that, without specific training, patients evolve to a level of 
syntactic proficiency mainly determined by the pattern of initial impairment and the 
degree of biologically conditioned "spontaneous" recovery. Interestingly, some 
agrammatic Broca patients showed significant verbal communicative improvements 
without showing improvements on neurolinguistic measures. A syntactic analysis re- 
vealed that these patients preferably produced bare VP (verb phrase) structures, which 
are syntactically simple, but potentially rich in information (Blomert & de Roo, 1992). 
This latter finding emphasizes that the results of syntactic elicitation procedures are 
not only sensitive to the context of the task, but also to the cognitive processes in- 
volved in formulating a communicative intention. Findings show that the ability to 
structure information at the propositional level (Levelt, 1989) may change dramati- 
cally over time (personal observation) and may be more important in determining 
the form and content of aphasic verbal utterances than is often assumed (Blomert, 
1990). 
The studies above show that the relearning of syntactically complex structures, 
often thought of as not relearnable in principle, may depend on the use of structured 
learning paradigms. It was also shown that the nature of the sentence elicitation pro- 
cedures influences the observed syntactic variability. The context of the task and 
therefore the relevance of the communicative intent help shape syntactic performance. 
The study of syntactic impairments in a meaningful context may help disentangle the 
mechanisms involved in the recovery from language and communication disorders. 
40-9. CONCLUSIONS 
In this chapter, I have argued that theories of recovery after brain damage should 
approach brain and language repair as a Siamese twin. Language relearning and neu- 
roplasticity work in concert to modify brain organization. It is suggested that longi- 
tudinal studies of symptom-specific small groups receiving structured learning tasks 
probably best probe the how-to-treat-what-and-when issue. Systematically varied com- 
binations of different intervention approaches and simultaneous pharmacological treat- 
ments are promising. Future rehabilitation programs may not only concentrate on 
enhancing recovery but also on preventing disabling adaptations. The occurrence of 

40 
Brain and Rehabilitation 
557 
these maladaptations deserves more attention in an era in which evidence from single 
cases is highly valued. Given the many new directions in recovery and rehabilitation 
research, it seems worthwhile to stress that it is critical to show the functionality of 
an improvement, independent of the approach, method, and language function chosen 
for treatment. Aphasic patients, like most of us, use language mainly as a communi- 
cative device.

Recovery and Treatment of Acquired 
Reading and Spelling Disorders

19140 
Studies of recovery and treatment of acquired language disorders are not new, 
but the application of such investigations to the development of neuropsychol- 
ogical models of language is a relatively recent development. Patterns of recovery 
and effects of treatment provide insight into the relations of the functional com- 
ponents of the language system and dynamics of processes that mediate verbal 
and written language. This chapter aims to acquaint the reader with recent ad- 
vances in the study of recovery and treatment of reading and spelling impair- 
ments resulting from acquired brain damage. 
This chapter focuses on the study of recovery and treatment of acquired dyslexias and 
dysgraphias--reading and spelling disorders. Although this enterprise is relatively 
young, it holds promise as a window on the dynamic relations among components of 
the reading system that are not readily apparent in cases studied at one period in time. 
We will begin with a brief overview of processes involved in reading and spelling 
and a description of neurologically based disorders of these processes. This will be

followed by a review of recent investigations of recovery and rehabilitation of reading 
and spelling. Most of the work in this area has been carried out on disorders of central 
reading and spelling mechanisms that process orthographic representations of lan- 
guage, as opposed to peripheral systems that process perceptual aspects of visual 
stimuli. Accordingly, this chapter will limit the discussion to those reading and spelling 
disorders that are due to disruption of linguistic processing of visual stimuli. As the 
review will indicate, these studies lead to some new insights into old questions, as 
well as many new questions that set the stage for future research in this area. 
41-1. PATHWAYS 
TO READING 
Peripheral visual systems are responsible for the analysis of the visual stimulus and 
identification of the visual form of letters within the visual context in which the letters 
are viewed. Linguistic processing of visual stimuli begins when the visual forms of 
letters are mapped onto abstract letter identities. These representations then map onto 
a word form and its corresponding semantic representations to mediate comprehension 
of the letter string. Pronunciation of the letter string, according to most models, can 
occur by a mapping of the semantic representations onto output phonological units. 
Reading words aloud, however, is not limited to this semantically mediated route. In 
fact, we can pronounce words that have no meaning and novel words whose meaning 
is unfamiliar via a direct conversion of the abstract letter representations extracted 
from the printed word to the phonological units that guide production processes. The 
conversion process entails segmenting the letter string into pronounceable units (syl- 
lables, morphological units, phonological segments), a process that takes time. For 
this reason, many models of reading assume a buffer that maintains phonological 
information as the input is processed. Ellis (1984) terms these two routes as "reading 
by ear" (orthographic to phonological conversion) and "reading by eye" (reading via 
access to the orthographic word-form store). It is likely that most readers use both 
routes when reading--sometimes relying on one over another depending on the nature 
of the stimulus. Impairment to these systems "fractionates" the pathways so that a 
dyslexic reader is forced to rely on one route over another. 
41-2. READING DISORDERS 
41-2.1. Pure Alexia or Alexia without Agraphia 
It is generally agreed that pure alexia reflects a failure in transmission of sensory 
feature information onto word units, but it remains a point of dispute whether the 
syndrome is due to a central or a peripheral visual processing disturbance. Patients 
with pure alexia are often referred to as letter-by-letter readers because they tend to 
laboriously read each letter of a printed word aloud in order to access its pronunciation. 
This syndrome was once attributed to a partial or complete impairment of the word- 

41 
Disorders of Reading and Spelling 
561 
form system (Warrington & Shallice, 1980). Subsequent studies indicated, however, 
that pure alexic patients gain access to some higher-level information via the printed 
word (Bub & Arguin, 1995; Coslett, Saffran, Greenbaum, & Schwartz, 1993). For 
example, they can perform lexical decision and semantic categorization tasks without 
explicit report. Additionally, reading performance improves with rapid presentation of 
words, presumably forcing a more visually based direct activation of lexical-semantic 
information. This evidence does not disprove the involvement of an impaired word- 
form system, but does indicate that such impairment can only be partial (Shallice & 
Saffran, 1986). 
There are numerous competing hypotheses regarding the fundamental impairment 
underlying pure alexia. Friedman and Alexander (1984) propose that the locus of the 
impairment is more peripheral at the early stages of visual analysis. Others have 
argued that the problem impairs the ability to synthesize multiple forms, a consequence 
of a more general visual deficit termed simultagnosia in which separate visual forms 
cannot be perceived simultaneously (Coslett & Saffran, 1989). Rapp and Caramazza 
(1991) propose that the deficit affects the efficiency of an early stage of processing 
in which attention is deployed across a spatial map of the visual stimulus. Finally, 
Behrmann and Shallice (1995) claim that the syndrome is rooted in a letter activation 
deficit in which rapid and efficient processing of single letters is disrupted. They argue 
that impairments described by previous accounts as the source of letter-by-letter read- 
ing are present in some, but not all, pure alexics. Letter processing is disrupted in 
most pure alexics, however, and this fact argues for the view that deficient letter 
processing leads to the letter-by-letter reading strategy. 
In addition to understanding the deficit underlying pure alexia, theorists seek an 
account of mechanisms underlying the residual reading abilities in this syndrome. How 
do pure alexics gain access to lexical and semantic information about words they 
cannot pronounce? One hypothesis is that their reading is mediated by access to a 
right-hemisphere lexicon that is known to be limited in the range of words it can 
process. This account is similar to that which has been proposed for reading patterns 
in deep dyslexia (see Section 41-3), although the impairments underlying the two 
syndromes are not the same. 
41-2.2. Surface Dyslexia 
Patients with this reading disorder rely on use of the phonological route that maps 
input orthography (abstract letter identities) onto output phonological representations 
(reading by "ear" in Ellis's [1984] terms). Dependence on this route for reading stems 
from a difficulty in mapping the abstract letter identities onto the input orthographic 
lexicon. Although the direct route is adequate for reading many words, it cannot be 
used to access the pronunciation of irregularly spelled words (spellings that do not 
correspond directly with the sounds used in pronunciation, for example, yacht). In 
order to access the pronunciation of irregularly spelled words, the reader must first 
access the word-level representation in the input orthographic lexicon and then use 
this representation to gain access to output phonology. 

562 
Nadine Martin 
Three characteristics of surface dyslexia reflect use of the orthographic-phonolog- 
ical route to reading. First, regularity effects are observed in reading; words whose 
spellings do not convert transparently to pronunciation will be mispronounced in a 
manner that forces the direct orthographic-phonological conversion. The word pint, 
for example, will be pronounced as /pint/ and blood will be read as /blud/. High- 
frequency irregularly spelled words may be preserved in these patients, suggesting 
that deployment of orthographic-phonological mappings may be influenced by the 
frequency of letter-sound associations such that more frequent mappings (for example, 
oo --->/u/) replace those that are relatively rare (for example, oo ~/U/). Nevertheless, 
the inability to read irregularly spelled words serves as evidence of a reading disorder 
that impairs access to the orthographic lexicon via written input. Second, reading- 
comprehension errors tend to reflect the reader's would-be pronunciation of the word. 
For example, the written word bear is defined as "something you would drink" (/bir/ 
beer). Third, these patients have a preserved ability to read nonwords with regular 
spellings (a task mediated by the orthographic-phonological conversion route). 
41-2.3. Phonological Dyslexia 
In this disorder we see a pattern somewhat opposite to that of surface dyslexia. There 
is no regularity effect and known words are read better than nonwords or unknown 
words. Word-class effects and morphological errors are also common in the reading 
pattern of this syndrome. Nouns are read better than function words and sometimes 
more accurately than verbs. Affix substitutions are common (for example, farming ---> 
farmer) and typically occur with inflectional affixes (for example, directed) more than 
derivational affixes (for example, direction). Inflectional affixes do not change mean- 
ing or grammatical class of word and are probably computed. Derivational affixes, on 
the other hand, are stored as whole words and are presumed to have their own lexical 
entry. Finally, concreteness effects (concrete words are read more accurately than 
abstract words) are sometimes present in these patients. This overall error pattern 
indicates that, to read aloud, the subject is relying on a reading pathway by which 
graphemic input maps onto representations in the orthographic lexicon, then onto 
representations in the phonological lexicon before phonological output systems are 
activated. 
41-3. DEEP DYSLEXIA 
This reading disorder shares many features with phonological dyslexia and has been 
characterized by some as a more extreme form of that syndrome (for example, Glosser 
& Friedman, 1990). The ability to read nonwords is severely impaired, indicating 
damage to the system that translates grapheme input directly to phonological output. 
Also, as in phonological dyslexia, errors occur on word inflections and function words. 
Visually based errors (kind ---> king; desire ---> desert) are common but tend to occur 
more often on abstract words. Two features that distinguish this syndrome from 

41 
Disorders of Reading and Spelling 
563 
phonological dyslexia are the production of semantic errors in reading single words 
(for example, tulip ~ crocus; applaud ~ clap) and the consistent presence of con- 
creteness effects in single-word reading. 
Most accounts of deep dyslexia postulate two functional impairments: one that 
disrupts the orthographic-phonological conversion route, and a second partial impair- 
ment of processes that disrupts reading by the lexical-semantic route (for example, 
Shallice, 1988). Of those theorists who view deep dyslexia as a severe form of pho- 
nological dyslexia, Glosser and Friedman (1990) propose that it is the severity of the 
semantic impairment that determines whether symptoms will be more in keeping with 
deep or phonological dyslexia. Evidence to support this hypothesized continuum 
comes primarily from investigations of recovery and will be addressed in more detail 
in the discussion of recovery studies. 
A well-known account of reading in deep dyslexia is that it is mediated by the 
unaffected right hemisphere. Patients with deep dyslexia often have very large lesions 
affecting language abilities other than reading. According to this account, access to 
the left hemisphere is rendered impossible by the impairment but does not preclude 
access to the limited language stored in the right hemisphere. Lexical entries accessed 
in the right hemisphere are used as input to output lexical systems in the left hemi- 
sphere (Coltheart, 1980). 
41-3.1. Nonsemantic Reading 
This reading impairment affects the later stages of processing written information. 
Words and sentences can be read, but are not understood. Nonwords can be read, and 
so in that sense, the syndrome resembles surface dyslexia. However, unlike that syn- 
drome, words with irregular spelling (that cannot be mapped directly to phonology; 
for example, leopard) can be read aloud. Schwartz, Saffran, and Marin (1980) first 
described this syndrome in a case report of a patient, W.L.P, who suffered from pre- 
senile dementia. W.L.P. showed a remarkable dissociation between her ability to read 
aloud both regularly and irregularly spelled words and her ability to comprehend those 
words. This finding provided strong evidence for a third route to reading aloud that 
makes use of word-form representations but not semantic information. 
41-4. PATHWAYS 
TO SPELLING 
When evaluating disorders of spelling, we must first consider that writing is not simply 
the reverse of reading in the same way that speaking is not simply the reverse of 
hearing and comprehending. There are parallels, however, in our taxonomy of spelling 
disorders. As in reading, the pathways to spelling vary depending on the task. Writ- 
ing thoughts to compose a letter involves a different combination of processes than 
writing a dictated letter or copying lecture notes from a chalkboard. Thus, it is con- 
ceivable that acquired brain damage might affect spelling ability via one route but not 
another. 

564 
Nadine Martin 
Spontaneous generation of written language (for example, writing a letter or story) 
is mediated by a mapping of conceptual-semantic representations onto word forms 
and their corresponding orthographic representations. Spelling words that are spoken 
can proceed by one of three pathways (Margolin & Goodman-Schulman, 1992). One 
route involves a direct mapping of nonlexical phonology onto individual orthographic 
segments. This route enables us to spell nonwords or unfamiliar words. Two other 
routes by which spoken words are spelled access output orthographic word forms by 
way of lexical phonology or semantics. Finally, the process of copying a written 
stimulus (word, nonword, letter) can be carried out by mapping orthographic units 
onto output orthographic representations or copying visual forms of letters directly 
without any access to the abstract letter identities they represent. In the latter case, 
writing is purely dependent on peripheral input and output mechanisms. 
41-5. SPELLING DISORDERS 
41-5.1. Surface (Lexical) Dysgraphia 
This disorder parallels surface dyslexia and is characterized by difficulty in accessing 
lexical-orthographic representations of words. Thus, spelling must be carried out pri- 
marily by relying on phoneme-grapheme correspondences. The clearest indication of 
a surface dysgraphia can be observed when a subject is asked to write irregularly 
spelled words. Regularization errors will be observed in this spelling-to-dictation task, 
that is, irregularly spelled words will be misspelled in a way that corresponds to their 
pronunciation (for example, broad will be written as brawd). 
41-5.2. Phonological Agraphia 
This disorder involves an inability to associate input phonological representations with 
output orthographic representations, thus forcing a reliance on orthographic word-form 
representations stored in lexical memory in order to write. A key symptom of pho- 
nological agraphia is a preserved ability to write words but not nonwords. Addition- 
ally, the ability to write irregularly spelled words is preserved. Other problems usually 
present in this syndrome include errors in retrieving affixes (because they are not 
stored lexically) and in accessing the spelling of low-frequency words (a consequence 
of relying on lexical information to mediate the spelling process). 
41-5.3. Deep Dysgraphia 
Symptoms of this disorder overlap with those of phonological agraphia, in the same 
way that deep and phonological dyslexia are related. Nonword spelling is impaired, 
and there are numerous errors in spelling grammatical words and inflectional mor- 
phemes. The ability to write concrete words is invariably better than the ability to 
write abstract words (a problem sometimes present in phonological dysgraphia), and 

41 
Disorders of Reading and Spelling 
565 
semantic errors (for example, star --~ moon, lilac ~ 
orchid) as well as visual errors 
(for example, rabbit --~ raffit) are produced in spelling to dictation. Finally, written 
output tends to be agrammatic in style, indicating that it is difficult for these subjects 
to access orthographic representations of grammatical/syntactic morphemes. 
41-6. STUDIES OF RECOVERY AND TREATMENT 
We now turn to the focus of this chapter: recovery and rehabilitation of reading and 
spelling disorders. What can be gained from an examination of changes in language 
performance that accompany recovery or treatment? Early neuropsychological inves- 
tigations of reading and spelling disorders aimed to identify symptom complexes that 
dissociated one process from another. These dissociations revealed the possible routes 
by which a task could be mediated but shed less light on the dynamics of information 
processing. A primary goal of recovery studies is to observe and account for change 
in language performance over time: How do once inaccessible representations become 
accessible? Treatment research is also essentially concerned with dynamics of pro- 
cessing in that a primary goal is to develop better means to effect change in language 
performance. Thus, recovery and treatment studies require theories that account for 
the dynamic aspects of information processing, but at the same time, they will provide 
an important testing ground for such theories. In this sense, studies of treatment and 
recovery have the potential to make an important contribution to neuropsychological 
theories. 
Apart from their theoretical contributions, recovery and treatment studies have 
obvious practical applications. Recovery studies serve as a useful guide to treatment 
of acquired language disorders (Behrmann, Black, & Bub, 1990) by outlining se- 
quences of changes over the course of recovery. Treatment studies identify stimuli, 
tasks, and modalities that maximize immediate and long-term improvements as well 
as generalization of these effects to untreated items. Of equal practical value, treat- 
ment studies identify stimuli and methods that do not effect change in a particular 
disorder. 
Currently, model-based investigations of recovery and treatment in the area of 
reading and spelling disorders are relatively few in number and sporadic with respect 
to the amount of attention paid to some syndromes over others. Nevertheless, they 
have made an important contribution to our understanding of the dynamic relations 
among processes and stages of representation in reading and spelling, and have led 
to a number of questions yet to be answered in future studies. We will now review 
critical studies of recovery and treatment of disorders of central processes of reading 
and spelling. 
41-6.1. Studies of Recovery 
The most informative recovery studies to date are those that have followed the evo- 
lution of deep dyslexia to phonological dyslexia. Recall that deep and phonological 

566 
Nadine Martin 
dyslexia share many features but differ in severity and in the presence of one specific 
error type, the semantic error (the defining feature of deep dyslexia). Early conceptions 
of deep dyslexia postulated two separate impairments affecting the two routes to read- 
ing--one more severely than the other. Friedman (1996) reviewed five cases of deep 
alexia whose symptoms evolved into the pattern associated with phonological dyslexia 
(Laine, Niemi, & Marttila, 1990; Glosser & Friedman, 1990 [two cases]; Job & 
Sartori, 1984; Klein, Behrmann, & Doctor, 1994). That is, the semantic errors that 
were present in the early stages of their disorder dropped out of the symptom complex 
as recovery ensued. In one case (Laine et al., 1990), the evolution was documented 
from 2 weeks post-onset, at which time the patient was unable to read a single word, 
to 4 years post-onset, at which time reading was near normal. Assessments at intervals 
over the course of recovery revealed stages at which the subject's reading was char- 
acteristic of deep dyslexia and then phonological dyslexia. Friedman (1996) has further 
identified a succession of symptoms along this evolution from deep to phonological 
dyslexia. 
This evolution of error patterns suggests that deep and phonological dyslexia rep- 
resent a single impairment whose symptoms vary along a continuum of severity. Klein 
et al. (1994) suggest that a double deficit remains a viable account of the disorder 
and propose that with recovery, only one reading route, the semantic route shows any 
recovery. In another version of this account, Friedman (1996) proposes that the dis- 
tinction between deep and phonological alexia lies in the severity of the semantic 
deficit. Thus, interpretation of this recovery pattern has, for the most part, adhered to 
the idea that two deficits underlie the more severe syndrome, deep dyslexia, and that 
recovery reflects changes in one of those routes. 
The double-deficit account of deep dyslexia and its relation to phonological dys- 
lexia developed largely on the basis of information-processing models that allow 
descriptions of impairments in terms of the locus within a model of language proc- 
essing and the level of representation affected by the impairment. A single impair- 
ment that affects phonological and semantic reading processes is conceivable in 
computational models (interactive activation and parallel distributed processing 
models) that postulate a highly interactive system in which representations proc- 
essed at one stage are not independent of representations processed at another ear- 
lier or later stage. Computational models allow exploration of the dynamics of proc- 
essing, an element critical to our understanding of changes in performance that 
accompany recovery and treatment. Two studies of recovery carried out in the 
framework of computational models are relevant to the relation of deep and pho- 
nological dyslexia. Martin, Saffran, and Dell (1996) proposed a single deficit ac- 
count of the recovery patterns observed in deep dysphasia (the auditory-spoken 
counterpart to deep dyslexia in which semantic errors are produced in repetition). 
This account defined the deficit in terms of processing characteristics (activation 
spread rate and activation decay rate) rather than locus of transmission route af- 
fected. Martin et al.'s (1996) patient was determined to have an impairment that af- 
fected maintenance of activated representations due to an abnormally high decay 
rate. Recovery, in this model, took the form of resolution of that decay rate toward 

41 
Disorders of Reading and Spelling 
567 
the "normal" premorbid rate. A similar account of the resolution of deep dyslexia 
to phonological dyslexia is conceivable in such a model. 
In another recent study, Plaut (1996) attempted to simulate resolution of pure alexia 
to deep dyslexia and then to phonological dyslexia in a connectionist network. Al- 
though the model successfully reproduced the early shift from few responses to the 
deep dyslexic pattern, it failed to produce the dropout of semantic errors that char- 
acterizes the evolution from deep to phonological dyslexia. This was the case when 
lesions were applied to connections between intermediate and semantic representations 
and also between orthographic and intermediate representations. This finding led Plaut 
(1996) to conclude that the evolution from deep to phonological dyslexia actually 
reflects improvements in both phonological and semantic routes of reading. Case stud- 
ies of recovery patterns echo this conclusion in that many patients show a recovery 
pattern in which the ability to read nonwords (a barometer of phonological function) 
improves in conjunction with the reduction of semantic errors. 
41-6.1.1. Recovery Patterns in Deep Alexia 
Recovery patterns in this rather severe impairment of reading have been documented 
by Behrmann et al. (1990). Their subject, D.S., was able to read words accurately 
with a letter-by-letter strategy, but only after considerable delay. Thus, Behrmann et 
al. (1990) based their investigation of recovery on changes in response latencies in 
conjunction with word-length effects rather than changes in error patterns. Letter- 
by-letter readers show increased reading times as a consequence of their laborious 
attempts to read words by reading each individual letter and this latency increases as 
word length increases. Behrmann et al. (1990) followed their subject from the 1st 
week post-onset and periodically over the following 12-month period. Initially, this 
patient showed all the classic symptoms of a severe pure alexia: intact visual and 
peripheral analytic abilities, letter-by-letter reading, and reading times that were pos- 
itively associated with word length. Additionally, D.S. displayed some ability to gain 
access to higher-level information about written words, but only with unlimited ex- 
posure time. Thus, the underlying impairment, difficulty in accessing the word-form 
system, was successfully circumvented by this patient with the letter-by-letter strategy. 
Behrmann et al. (1990) found that reading times improved dramatically with recovery, 
although they still remained below normal. Nevertheless, subsequent testing of the 
underlying deficit (access to the word form) revealed no evidence of improvement. 
Behrmann and her colleagues concluded that improved reading times resulted from 
an improvement in D.S.'s compensatory reading strategy rather than any resolution 
of the underlying deficit. 
This case study emphasizes that recovery can take two forms and illustrates the 
relevance of recovery patterns to treatment research. Changes in reading ability asso- 
ciated with recovery from pure alexia can occur because impaired mechanisms recover 
or because compensatory strategies become more efficient (see also Tuomainen & 
Laine, 1991). Thus, a therapist can determine which approach coincides with a sub- 
ject's natural course of recovery and treat the deficit accordingly.

41-6.2. Studies of Treatment 
41-6.2.1. Deep and Phonological Dyslexia 
Most treatment studies of deep dyslexia and its near relative, phonological dyslexia, 
have focused on direct retraining or reestablishment of the impaired orthographic- 
phonological route. An important early study of treatment for acquired deep dyslexia 
(de Partz, 1986) illustrates how early models of the functional organization of reading 
processes served as a useful guide to an organized program of treatment. De Partz 
(1986) treated the reading deficit in a deep dyslexic subject by systematically retrain- 
ing the impaired orthographic-phonological conversion route. Initially, the subject was 
taught cue words whose initial segments held direct grapheme-phoneme correspon- 
dences to associate with each letter of the written alphabet. Following this, the subject 
was taught to blend the grapheme-phoneme correspondences into words. The first part 
of the program targeted only those correspondences in which a single letter and sound 
are associated. The final part of the program involved training correspondences in 
which a single phoneme was represented by a sequence of graphemes (for example, 
/u/~ ou). Although de Partz demonstrated substantial improvement in this subject's 
reading, it was not entirely clear that the changes were due to the treatment alone 
since the training program coincided with the period of natural recovery. 
In a more recent study, Nickels (1992) applied the treatment program developed 
by de Partz (1986) to a patient, T.C., with a more long-standing (11 months post- 
CVA) reading impairment. Using link words as cues to the identities of grapheme- 
phoneme correspondences, Nickels demonstrated improvement in her subject's ability 
to link graphemes with corresponding phonemes. However, T.C. remained unable to 
blend the grapheme-phoneme correspondences into words (except high-imageability 
words) and nonwords. Patterson (1994) notes that these two studies illustrate how a 
particular therapy technique may not have identical effects in all subjects with a com- 
mon reading deficit (in this example, deep dyslexia) because more than one underlying 
impairment may give rise to a set of symptoms associated with that deficit. This 
necessitates that treatment studies provide accounts for the deficits being treated as 
well as the changes that occur in response to treatment (Patterson, 1994). 
Treatment programs for deep dysgraphia (which frequently co-occurs with deep 
dyslexia) have also made use of cues to link known words with words that cannot be 
spelled. Hatfield (1983) pioneered the use of a link-word technique to tackle the 
problem of deep dysgraphics' difficulty in spelling closed-class words. She trained 
subjects to link a content word that could be spelled by the subject with an ortho- 
graphically similar closed-class word (for example, INN ---> IN). This technique con- 
tinues to be applied in more recent studies of treatment in deep dysgraphia (for ex- 
ample, Carlomagno & Parlato, 1989). The associative cues provide a means by which 
access can be facilitated. More specifically, the content word cues (as were used in 
Hatfield's study) supply a link with a semantic representation that is richer and more 
accessible than any semantic level representation normally accorded a closed-class 
word. If deep dyslexia and dysgraphia do indeed reflect reading by the semantic route 

41 
Disorders of Reading and Spelling 
569 
(or reliance on semantic representations to gain access to grapheme representations), 
then this interpretation is plausible. 
41-6.2.2. Treatment of Pure Alexia 
Behrmann et al.'s (1990) study of recovery patterns in this syndrome (see Section 41- 
6.1.1) demonstrated two paths of recovery that would lead to a reduction in the letter- 
by-letter reading strategy observed in pure alexics. Other studies confirm that effects 
of treatment strategies differ depending on whether they address compensatory strat- 
egies or the impairment itself (for example, Coslett & Saffran, 1989; Rothi et al., 
1985). Whereas the subject of Behrmann et al. (1990) did not show improved access 
to the word-form system with the improved compensatory strategy, other subjects 
have shown such improvement with treatments that emphasize direct access to the 
word-form system, even after natural recovery processes have occurred (Rothi et al., 
1985). These investigations of pure alexia have two important implications for treat- 
ment. First, Rothi et al.'s (1985) subject showed reading improvement 4 years after 
onset of the disorder and in spite of a firmly established letter-by-letter reading strat- 
egy. This indicates that the subject shifted reading strategies and that direct training 
led to that shift (Coslett & Saffran, 1989). Thus, although access to the word-form 
system might improve naturally, it can also be "trained" with some possibility of 
success. Second, like many treatment studies targeting other language impairments, 
improvements in function are noted long after spontaneous recovery has occurred, 
indicating that continued treatment after neurophysiological recovery is justified. 
41-6.2.3. Treatment of Surface Dyslexia and Dysgraphia 
A central goal in many treatments of surface dyslexia (which affects access to the 
meaning of written words) is to facilitate direct or indirect access to semantic infor- 
mation about words that are being read; that is, treatments tend to include some means 
of forcing the subject to learn a written word's meaning. One subject, E.E., studied 
by Coltheart and Byng (1989), showed the typical surface dyslexic pattern indicating 
an inability to derive semantics from orthography. Coltheart & Byng directed training 
specifically toward relearning the pronunciation of words with highly irregular spell- 
ings. Rather than just drilling E.E. on these pronunciations, however, they included 
pictures that corresponded to the irregularly spelled words. Combining the semantic 
representation with the word-pronunciation drill resulted in improved performance on 
both treated and untreated words. In another study, Scott & Byng (1988) incorporated 
a semantic task into treatment of reading in a surface dyslexic, J.B., who made errors 
on homophones (words that sound similar but are spelled differently and have different 
meanings). They used a sentence completion task in which J.B. had to choose the 
target word among other words. Here, the subject is asked to consider a written word's 
meaning and is cued not by a picture but by the circumstances described by the 
sentence to be completed. 

570 
Nadine Martin 
The importance of (re)establishing links between written words and their meanings 
is also apparent in treatment studies of surface dysgraphia. Behrmann (1987) used 
training tasks that paired a written word with its meaning (sentence completion, picture 
matching) in a treatment program for a surface dysgraphic 53-year-old patient, C.C.M. 
Training was carried out in two stages, the first to train spellings of homophonic word 
pairs and the second to train spellings of nonhomophonic irregular words. The pictures 
were used to distinguish the meanings of the homophonic words. Of interest in this 
study was the finding that training generalized to untrained words with irregular spell- 
ings, but not to untrained homophonic pairs. In a more recent study, de Partz, Seron, 
and Van der Linden (1992) used an imagery technique to facilitate access to spellings 
of words with ambiguous or irregular spellings. Specifically, they trained the subject 
to associate a visual image semantically related to the whole word's meaning but also 
visually similar to the letters in the misspelled portion of the word. The purpose of 
the visual-semantic cues was to facilitate memorization of the ambiguous and irregular 
spellings. They were found to be effective compared to no training and to more classic 
training approaches using repetitive presentation of the ambiguous and irregularly 
spelled words. 
The positive effects of combined semantic and phonological stimulation have been 
emphasized by a number of authors in the treatment of anomia (for example, Howard, 
Patterson, Franklin, Orchard-Lisle, & Morton, 1985; Nettleton & Lesser, 1991), a 
disorder that parallels surface dysgraphia in that it involves an inability to link word 
meanings with the phonological form. This combined approach has been shown to 
have a more profound effect on the endurance of treatment effects as well as gener- 
alization of those effects to untrained items. Generalization of effects is notoriously 
difficult to obtain, and there are few strong clues as to what should be effective in 
this regard. Thus, the success of studies employing combined semantic-phonological 
or semantic-orthographic stimulation to access written or spoken word forms repre- 
sents a significant contribution to the treatment literature. 
Generalization of treatment effects remains an important area of investigation, and 
despite the success of some approaches, others have met with little success. It is 
equally important to understand why one treatment is effective and why another treat- 
ment is ineffective. This is particularly true when a theory predicts success of a par- 
ticular treatment strategy. The next few studies report training programs in which 
improvement was restricted to the items that were trained. 
Hillis (1993) studied immediate effects and generalization of treatment on a subject, 
ES., who had multiple impairments affecting different sites within the reading system. 
Treatments were tailored to the levels of representation affected. For example, in order 
to improve function of the phonological route, treatment involved direct training of 
grapheme-phoneme correspondences. To improve access to lexical-orthographic rep- 
resentations, a lexical decision training task was used. And finally, to improve reading 
by the semantic route, homophonic pairs were used in tasks that connect a written 
word with some representation of its meaning (definition, picture, sentence comple- 
tion). Although all treatments were effective in improving performance on targeted 
items, generalization was minimal. 

41 
Disorders of Reading and Spelling 
571 
Behrmann and Lieberthal (1989) investigated treatment of the reading abilities of 
C. H., a 57-year-old globally aphasic subject who demonstrated, among other things, 
severe semantic impairment. Therapy was directed toward improving the association 
of words and their meanings. Treatment generalization was tested within semantic 
categories; that is, generalization was anticipated from treated words to untreated 
words within the same semantic category. Some generalization was obtained between 
treated and untreated items, but the amount varied considerably across semantic cat- 
egories. 
As these studies indicate, the mechanisms that maximize generalization to untrained 
items are poorly understood. Clearly, incorporation of semantic processing in treatment 
is an important aspect, but even this is not always effective. The Behrmann and 
Lieberthal (1989) study suggests that we should anticipate generalization primarily to 
semantically related untrained items, although category effects may lead to inconsis- 
tent generalization. Plaut (1996) provides a useful insight into this issue in a simulation 
study of treatment changes in reading within a connectionist network model of read- 
ing. He notes that generalization of retraining after the network is lesioned is influ- 
enced by the structure of mapping between orthography and semantics and that the 
structure of that mapping is related to the extent to which word units are semantically 
organized. Thus, generalization should depend in part on the degree to which a set of 
treated words encompasses an estimate of the semantic characteristics of other words 
within that semantic category. Plaut (1996) proposed that using a set of words rep- 
resenting atypical members of a category would provide the estimate needed to 
achieve generalization to both atypical and prototypical members of a category. This 
is because relatively atypical members contain (collectively) more features of all mem- 
bers of a category than prototypical members and thus would provide more infor- 
mation about the overall structure of that category. Plaut demonstrated this principle 
in a simulation of reading in which trained words varied in the typicality of their 
semantic representations. This study is an excellent demonstration of the ways in 
which connectionist models can be used to demonstrate effects that depend on dy- 
namics of processing. 
41-7. SUMMARY 
AND INDICATIONS 
FOR FUTURE RESEARCH 
In this review of studies that focus on processes of change that accompany recovery 
and treatment of reading and spelling disorders, I have tried to illustrate the major 
issues targeted in such investigations and some current approaches employed in studies 
of recovery. There are practical issues to resolve such as documenting the course of 
recovery, identifying stimuli and methods that result in long-term effects of treatment, 
and maximizing generalization of treatment from trained to untrained items. Addi- 
tionally, there are theoretical issues of importance such as the relationship among 
components and processes that compose the language system and the nature of proc- 
esses underlying facilitation effects obtained in treatment.

The practical concerns of treatment studies have been greatly aided by the devel- 
opment of theoretical models that identify possible routes to mediate a particular task 
such as reading. These models provide a framework within which a reading impair- 
ment can be diagnosed in terms of its functional characteristics. In turn, the model- 
based diagnosis is readily translatable into an appropriate set of treatment tasks that 
consider the characteristics of the words to be treated (for example, semantic versus 
phonological characteristics) and processes that need to be reestablished (for example, 
phoneme-grapheme correspondences). The success of these studies in recent years has 
established the use of a psychological model of cognition to devise a treatment plan 
as the standard approach to investigating treatment issues. This enterprise has been 
further aided by the introduction of connectionist models of language. Such models 
enable a description of the dynamics of processing written and spoken language that 
are central to our understanding of recovery and treatment effects. 
Although our understanding of processes underlying treatment and recovery is in 
its infancy, there is no better time for this enterprise to proceed. Our knowledge of 
the functional components of language systems is well established, and in recent years 
our knowledge of the dynamic relations among those components has increased 
greatly. Advances in computer implementations of cognitive models provide a means 
to make and test predictions about dynamics of processing that previously was not 
available. It is likely that treatment and recovery studies will grow in number and 
quality in the next decade, in part because the means to pursue critical questions about 
these processes are available, but also because the endeavor has a direct application 
to theoretical issues as well as to treatment of neuropsychological impairments such 
as reading and spelling.

Treatment of Childhood

Childhood dyslexia is a disorder affecting the acquisition of written language. 
Approaches to treatment can be discussed in relation to questions about the 
causes of the difficulty, and the cognitive architecture and development of the 
reading process. According to peripheralist theories, treatment should be di- 
rected toward a cause located in the transient component of the visual or au- 
ditory systems, or in higher-level visual orthographic or phonological processes. 
The alternative view places the difficulty in one or more of the components 
of a central orthographic system. The important questions for treatment con- 
cern the linkage between orthographic and phonological segments, the size and 
nature of these segments, and their interaction with stages of reading devel- 
opment. 
The term "dyslexia" refers to disorders that affect the use of written language. It is 
well known that reading and spelling processes can be disturbed by damage to the 
mature brain, producing an acquired dyslexia or dysgraphia (Ellis & Young, 1988). 
Such damage generally involves the left (language) hemisphere. The disorder can also 
occur in a childhood form, producing a developmental dyslexia in which the learning 
of the basic elements of reading and writing is affected (Critchley, 1970). Possible 
connections with developmental pathology of the left hemisphere have been suggested

(Galaburda, Sherman, Rosen, Aboitiz, & Geschwind, 1985), and also a dependence 
on a genetic etiology (De Fries, 1991). 
This chapter is concerned mainly with childhood dyslexia. The disorder is manifest 
as a failure to advance in a normal age-related way when appropriate instruction in 
reading and spelling is provided in school. It is held that the difficulty may be dis- 
sociated from general intelligence. Opinions differ as to whether it should be viewed 
as an isolated disorder, specifically affecting written language processes, or whether 
it is part of a larger syndrome that includes more general disturbances of language 
processing (Miles, 1983). A view that is currently widely favored states that the read- 
ing and spelling difficulty is commonly associated with a disturbance of phonological 
processing that constitutes a proximal cause of the dyslexia, and that may affect other 
aspects of language, such as syntactic processing and comprehension (Stanovich, 
1988; Pennington, 1991; Shankweiler & Crain, 1987). 
The objective in this chapter is to examine questions concerning the most appro- 
priate forms of treatment of dyslexic disorders. In particular, the aim is to draw on 
current neuropsychological research and theory in order to consider whether particular 
recommendations can be supported. To do this, it will be necessary to explore a 
number of fundamental issues, including the following: 
1. Does dyslexia have an identifiable cause ? If so, at what level (physiological, 
sensory, cognitive) should the cause be defined? Can the disorder be treated 
by removal or amelioration of the cause? 
2. What is the structure of the cognitive system that supports reading and 
spelling? Can different forms of dyslexia be identified, depending on which 
components are most affected? If so, do such differences have implications 
for the design of treatment programs? 
3. Is there a normal sequence in reading and spelling development? If so, should 
treatment programs mimic the normal sequence? 
42-1. CAUSAL 
ARCHITECTURE 
The second of the questions above refers to the cognitive architecture of the processes 
involved in reading and spelling. This has typically been represented as an arrange- 
ment of specialized processors (or "modules") that are linked by pathways along 
which information can be transferred (the "box-and-arrow" models). These models 
have proved valuable in the study of the acquired dyslexias because they have made 
it possible to formulate and test hypotheses regarding the particular components or 
pathways that have been compromised by neurological damage (Ellis & Young, 1988). 
This information is held to be relevant for the design of treatments in that the iden- 
tification of the damaged functions provides a rationale for the direction of remediation 
(Coltheart, Bates, & Castles, 1994). 
The cognitive architecture models represent the systems involved in the processing 
of information. As such, they are well adapted for the description of the failures to 

42 
Treatment of Childhood Dyslexia 
575 
perform standard tasks (such as reading aloud of words or nonwords) that are char- 
acteristic of acquired dyslexia. However, the models do not address the first issue, the 
question of causation, or the third issue, the course of reading development. On these 
grounds, it can be argued that a theoretical model that represents both the architecture 
of the cognitive system and causal influences on the development of processes may 
be needed as a first step in a discussion of the treatment of developmental dyslexia. 
A schematic format for such a model is presented in Figure 1. The framework incor- 
porates the distinction between central and peripheral processes that has previously 
been applied in the studies of the acquired dyslexias (Shallice, 1988). Thus, it is 
suggested that reading and spelling depend on the integrity of a set of "central ortho- 
graphic processes." There are, in addition, various peripheral processes that deal with 
the reception and categorization of visual and auditory input. 
The diagram in Figure 1 is intended to illustrate two general hypotheses about the 
causes of developmental reading disorders. One hypothesis states that the cause is 
intrinsic to the central orthographic processes themselves. The other ascribes the dif- 
ficulty to a peripheral process that is functionally adjacent to the central processes 
and that provides them with essential data. If the first hypothesis is correct, it would 
be appropriate to direct treatment toward the construction of the central orthographic 
processes. Further, if the process has an internal modular structure, treatment should 
be directed toward the subcomponent that is most severely affected. If the second 
hypothesis is correct, it would become important to identify the peripheral process 
that was impaired so that remediation could, perhaps, be directed toward that process. 
This peripheralist hypothesis will be considered first.

42-2. PERIPHERALIST HYPOTHESES 
Figure 1 suggests the existence of a number of modular processing systems in addition 
to the central orthographic processes. In the diagram, the arrows represent causal 
influences of an adverse or beneficial nature rather than information flow. The addi- 
tional components can be viewed as peripheral visual and auditory processes, which 
can be defined at two levels. The first level concerns the functioning of the sensory 
pathways that are involved in the direct acquisition of information from the environ- 
ment. These are referred to as "low-level" processes in the diagram. The second level 
is cognitive and deals with the internal representation of incoming information, in- 
cluding, for example, the possibility of distinct processors for categorization of visual 
objects and written language. 
42-2.1. Low-Level Visual Processes 
The first of the peripheralist hypotheses holds that central dyslexic difficulties result 
from an impairment located in the visual processing pathways. At the level of phys- 
iology and basic sensory functioning, the visual system is held to be divisible into 
two pathways, which are referred to as the parvocellular (P) or "sustained" channel, 
and the magnocellular (M) or "transient" channel (Lehmkuhle, 1993). The pathways 
may be traced from the retina through the lateral geniculate nuclei into the visual 
cortex and are associated with differing processing characteristics. In particular, the P 
pathway is specialized for perception of color and detail (high spatial frequencies) 
over an extended period of processing time, whereas the M pathway responds rapidly 
and briefly to stimulus change and deals with global features of patterns (low spatial 
frequencies). There is accumulating evidence that dyslexia may be associated with 
abnormally slow functioning in the M (transient) pathway. This comes from anatom- 
ical studies (Livingstone, Rosen, Drislane, & Galaburda, 1991) and from perceptual 
studies of evoked potentials and stimulus judgments (Lovegrove, Martin, & Slaghuis, 
1986) in which the spatial and temporal frequencies of simple patterns (gratings or 
checkerboards) have been systematically manipulated. 
Figure 1 suggests that an adverse influence of an impaired visual transient system 
on central reading and spelling processes presupposes an intervening effect on the 
visual cognitive analyzers. One possibility is that the transient system defect influences 
visual object recognition (link [a]) which in turn affects the establishment of a spe- 
cialized visual (orthographic) processor (link [c]) which in its turn undermines the 
development of the central processes (link [d]). A second is that the transient system 
defect directly affects the development of the visual (orthographic) processor (link 
[b]). At the present time, the studies needed to trace these possible connections have 
not been carried out. Hence, although there is good evidence of a co-occurrence of 
transient system defects and central reading difficulties, the underlying causal mech- 
anism has not been adequately documented. Indeed, the main interpretation of the 
effect has focused on eye movements in reading, and the role of the transient system 

42 
Treatment of Childhood Dyslexia 
577 
in clearing the sustained channel prior to reception of new input following a saccade 
(Breitmeyer, 1993). 
If the transient system is the origin of difficulty, then an implication is that treat- 
ments that improve transient system functioning might be effective. These could in- 
clude manipulations of text format, such as reduction in line length (to reduce the 
involvement of saccadic eye movements) or changes in the color of letters or back- 
ground that are calculated to enhance transient system responsiveness (Lovegrove & 
Williams, 1993). A convincing case for the applicability of this type of treatment 
would require (a) a demonstration of the effect on transient system processing; (b) 
confirmation of improved functioning at the visual (orthographic) level; and (c) an 
analysis of central reading processes that showed changes in specific components. In 
the absence of studies of this type, the value of peripheral visual treatments of dyslexia 
remains uncertain. 
42-2.2. Visual Orthographic Processes 
A common element in the visual hypothesis is the suggestion that the central reading 
impairment depends on a dysfunction in the visual (orthographic) processor (link [d]). 
This could occur, independently of the status of the low-level processes, if the neural 
substrate of the processor was underresourced. It is possible to test for deficiencies 
located within the processor by using reaction time methods, including same-different 
judgments of letter arrays and analyses of effects of distortion of format (e.g., zigzag 
or vertical arrangements of letters). Studies of this type indicate that a proportion of 
dyslexic children (maybe 50% or more) exhibit entirely normal processing at this level 
(Seymour & Evans, 1993). According to the model in Figure 1, this means that the 
visual hypothesis cannot be true of all cases of dyslexia, but may be appropriate for 
a subset of cases. This could be connected with the proposed differentiation within 
the central orthographic processes (see Figure 1), that is, with the distinction between 
lexical and nonlexical processes. Thus, it might be that an impairment of the visual 
(orthographic) processor undermines only one aspect of the central process, for ex- 
ample, the lexical pathways that are required for word identification and spelling. If 
this was true, it could follow that treatment directed at the efficiency of visual (or- 
thographic) processes might be appropriate only for cases having a predominant im- 
pairment of the lexical processes. 
In order to support this more differentiated hypothesis, one would wish to establish 
that impaired visual (orthographic) processing accompanied a central dyslexia of the 
lexical (or "surface") type. In this context, it will be important to recognize that the 
functions of the peripheral processor are, in themselves, quite complex, and may 
include aspects such as (a) the internalization of sequential regularities in legal letter 
sequences; (b) a capability for "analytic" (letter-by-letter) processing; and (c) a ca- 
pability for "global" processing of entire words or segments of words (morphemes, 
syllables, and so forth). There is evidence that "surface dyslexia" is particularly as- 
sociated with impairment of the "global" functioning of the visual processor 

578 
Philip H. K. Seymour 
(Seymour & Evans, 1993). This is because surface dyslexic individuals appear unable 
to recognize words as familiar wholes and characteristically resort to an analytic letter- 
by-letter mode of processing. Nonetheless, studies that have sought to establish a link 
between specific impairments of the visual processor and particular forms of central 
dyslexia have not produced particularly clear outcomes. Seymour (1986) found some 
cases who exhibited large effects in visual (orthographic) processing that were not 
associated with comparable central effects. Nor has it proved possible to establish a 
secure association between impaired holistic visual processing of letter arrays and 
"surface dyslexia" (Seymour & Evans, 1993). Hence, although there is a good prima 
facie case for attempting to treat "surface dyslexia" by training the global function 
of the visual (orthographic) processor, there is currently a lack of evidence that the 
connection is a real one. 
Also, it remains unclear what the best method of training might be. Seymour and 
Bunce (1994) reported a longitudinal treatment study of a surface dyslexic boy, R.C. 
Despite prolonged training, which was effective in improving lexical reading and 
spelling, the underlying approach remained strongly sequential (indexed by the effects 
of variations in word length on the reading reaction time). It is worth noting that other 
individuals show a contrasting pattern that suggests an impairment of the "analytic" 
function of the visual processor. This is shown by an overreliance on global processing 
that is effective in recognition of whole words but that results in numerous errors 
when attempts are made to read unfamiliar nonwords. Seymour and Bunce (1994) 
described a second case, D.K., of this type. In this instance, training that was directed 
toward the adoption of a more analytic approach to reading was effective in improving 
accuracy of response to nonwords. The training also produced a change in processing 
strategy, including the adoption of a more deliberate and analytic procedure when 
attempting to read unfamiliar forms (indexed by changes in reaction time distribu- 
tions). 
42-2.3. Auditory Processes 
The second main hypothesis represented in Figure 1 is that dyslexia results from a 
peripheral cause that is located in the auditory system. The arguments here are very 
similar to those that have been mounted in respect of the visual hypothesis. It is held 
that the processing of incoming speech stimuli takes place within an auditory pathway 
that includes a "transient" component sensitive to the rapid shifts in acoustic char- 
acteristics that convey information necessary for the categorization of speech seg- 
ments. There is evidence from anatomical studies of the medial geniculate nucleus 
(Galaburda, Menard, & Rosen, 1994) and from psychophysical procedures (Tallal, 
1980) that this auditory transient system may be defective in cases of dyslexia. 
The contention that a peripheral disturbance of speech processing might be causally 
related to dyslexia raises questions about the existence of the connections illustrated 
in Figure 1. It would be desirable to be able to show that the auditory transient sys- 
tem disturbance was associated with deficiencies in a "phonological processor" in 
which speech segments may be represented and manipulated (link [e]), and that this 

42 
Treatment of Childhood Dyslexia 
579 
disturbance was, in its turn, associated with a specific impairment of the central read- 
ing processes (link [f]). Alternatively, it would be necessary to show that training that 
improved auditory processing exerted a consequent effect on the activities of the 
phonological processor, and that this eventually led to improved reading and spelling. 
Tallal et al. (1996) have indicated that this might be done by modifying the duration 
or intensity of the critical segments of the speech signal. However, it is not known 
whether the expected effects on phonological processing and reading would follow 
from the application of such treatments. 
42-2.4. Phonological Processes 
At the present time, the most widely acknowledged hypothesis regarding the causation 
of dyslexia postulates an influence of "phonological processing" on the central read- 
ing processes (link [f]). This could arise independently of the integrity of low-level 
auditory processes as a consequence of neural underresourcing of the phonological 
processor. A large amount of research has been directed toward the evaluation of this 
hypothesis. In essence, this research has aimed (a) to develop methods of measuring 
the functioning of the phonological processor; (b) to show that an association exists 
between impaired phonological functioning and impaired reading; and (c) to demon- 
strate that the direction of training toward the phonological processor will exert a benefi- 
cial effect on reading development. Various techniques for assessment of "phonological 
awareness" have been devised, the common feature being a requirement to isolate and 
manipulate segments of speech (by counting, addition or deletion of elements, inver- 
sion of sequence, and so forth). Ability to perform these speech manipulation tasks 
is strongly and reliably correlated with reading progress (Goswami & Bryant, 1990). 
This research supports the reality of link (f) in Figure 1. However, there are some 
complications. One of these concerns the size and nature of the phonological units 
that are held to be related to reading acquisition. In the past, it has been maintained 
that small segments of speech, the phonemes of the language, are crucial, because 
these units stand in an approximate correspondence with the letters of the alphabet 
and form the basis of the relationship between written and spoken language (Gough 
& Hillinger, 1980). But the studies suggest that preliterate children are not aware of 
the phonemic structure of speech and that it is only after formal instruction in alpha- 
betic reading that children begin to succeed in phoneme manipulation tasks (Goswami 
& Bryant, 1990). This raises a question about the directionality of link (f). It looks 
as though reading acquisition influences phonological processing, implying the reverse 
of the direction of influence, or at least the possibility of bidirectionality (Morais, 
Alegria, & Content, 1987). 
In addition, it has been noted that preliterate children may be able to demonstrate 
awareness of some segments of speech, particularly if the units involved are large 
ones, such as whole syllables or rhymes. This observation has been discussed in the 
context of linguistic analyses of the internal structure of the syllable, particularly the 
suggestion that an intermediate level of organization into an onset group (the initial 
consonant or consonants) and a rime group (the vowel + final consonants) can be 

580 
Philip H. K. Seymour 
identified (Treiman, 1992). The ability of preliterate children to perform tasks such as 
oddity detection with sets of words that are distinguished in terms of onsets or rimes 
has been taken to imply that the phonological processor supports an awareness of 
these segments (Goswami & Bryant, 1990). As a corollary, it is argued that phono- 
logical processes influence reading development by supporting a classification of 
words in terms of onsets and rimes and the development of a capacity to read new 
words by looking for rime analogies with known words (Goswami, 1993). 
It follows that the implications of the phonological hypothesis for the remediation 
of dyslexic difficulties are somewhat ambiguous. It is not clear whether teachers 
should emphasize large units (rimes) or whether they should emphasize small units 
(phonemes). Further, the uncertainty about the directionality of link (f) means that 
teachers cannot be confident that a deficiency within the phonological processor can 
be identified as a cause of the reading difficulty that might be corrected by the direction 
of training toward the processor. 
An effective test of this possibility requires that training in speech manipulation 
should be shown to be successful (i.e., to result in a clear improvement in phono- 
logical skill) and to result in consequent gains in reading. Some positive results 
have been obtained by Lundberg and his group in Scandanavia. Lundberg, Frost, 
and Petersen (1988) trained preliterate kindergartners in a range of phonological ac- 
tivities that had large effects on phonological skill and produced advantages in later 
reading and spelling relative to the results obtained from a control group. Lundberg 
(1994) subsequently reported results for a subset of children who had performed 
poorly on phonological tasks at the outset of the study and who could, accordingly, 
be seen as being "at risk" for the development of subsequent reading difficulties. 
The comparison with similar control cases suggested that phonological training had 
had the effect of offsetting the risk of reading difficulty. However, a comparable 
study by Bradley and Bryant (1983), directed toward children who had shown poor 
preliterate skills in rime oddity detection, did not demonstrate significant gains in 
reading following two years of phonological training (carried out concurrently with 
normal instruction in reading). 
Hatcher, Hulme, and Ellis (1994) investigated the effect of intensive phonological 
training on 7-year-old children with documented reading difficulties. This was effec- 
tive in producing improvements in phonological skill, but no consequent gain in read- 
ing and spelling occurred. Hence, this study calls into question the assumptions (a) 
that there is a unidirectional causal link from phonological processing to reading, and 
(b) that direction of treatment toward the phonological processor is an effective 
method of improving reading difficulties. 
42-3. CENTRALIST HYPOTHESES 
It is assumed (Figure 1) that the literate brain contains a set of "orthographic proc- 
esses" that support information about written word forms, print-sound correspon- 
dences, and links with semantics. Damage to the neural basis of these processes will 

42 
Treatment of Childhood Dyslexia 
581 
produce a "central dyslexia." In the diagram, it is suggested that the central ortho- 
graphic process may have its own internal modular structure, which is organized 
around the distinctions between input and output (reading and spelling), and between 
lexical (word-specific) and nonlexical (letter-sound) processes. These submodules may 
themselves be vulnerable to damage, allowing for the possibility that central dyslexias 
may take different forms, depending in particular on whether the predominant effect 
is on the lexical processes or on the nonlexical processes. Such effects are by now 
well documented and support a distinction between two categories of central dyslexia: 
(1) "surface dyslexia," which reflects damage to the lexical processes, and (2) "pho- 
nological dyslexia," which results from damage to the nonlexical processes (Shallice, 
1988; Ellis, & Young, 1988). A similar contrast can be observed in spelling ("surface 
dysgraphia" versus "phonological dysgraphia"). 
With regard to developmental disorders, the critical question is whether an analo- 
gous pattern of contrasting difficulties can be observed in children who are having 
difficulty in learning to read. Castles and Coltheart (1993) have maintained that de- 
velopmental forms of "surface dyslexia" and "phonological dyslexia" occur. In their 
study, the reading of words of irregular spelling was treated as an index of the lexical 
process and the reading of nonwords as an index of the nonlexical process. Results 
obtained from severely dyslexic children were compared with results of normal readers 
of the same age (chronological age, or CA match) in a regression analysis. Castles 
and Coltheart (1993) reported that there were some dyslexic children who exhibited 
impaired irregular word reading combined with "normal" (within chronological age 
range) nonword reading, and others who displayed the opposite pattern (impaired 
nonword reading combined with normal irregular word reading). They argued that 
dyslexic children present a dissociation between surface and phonological patterns of 
dyslexia that is comparable to that found in adults. Their conclusion was that the 
dual process (lexical, nonlexical) model of the cognitive architecture of the central 
orthographic processes was applicable to developmental disorders as well as to adult 
disorders. 
According to the centralist hypothesis, the basis of developmental dyslexia is an 
underresourcing of the neural substrate of the central orthographic processes. One 
implication is that, to be effective, remedial training should be directed toward the 
orthographic processes themselves and not toward a peripheral process. This impli- 
cation is supported by the intervention studies. Bradley and Bryant (1983) gave one 
of their groups of "at risk" children training that included both practice in classifying 
spoken words according to their sounds and demonstrations of the way in which these 
distinctions were reflected in the letters making up the words. This dual approach 
resulted in substantial gains in reading and spelling. Hatcher et al. (1994) treated one 
of their groups of 7-year-old dyslexic readers in a similar way. A group that received 
phonological training combined with reference to letters and orthography improved 
their reading and spelling relative to an untreated control and to groups receiving 
training in phonology alone or (nonphonological) remedial reading. The authors con- 
cluded that the key requirement for successful remediation was the teaching of linkage 
between phonological segments and orthography. The question, raised earlier, of the 

582 
Philip H. K. Seymour 
size and nature of the segments was not addressed in this study. Thus, it remains 
unclear whether the linkage should be established for small units (phonemes) or for 
large units (onsets and rimes). 
A further issue that was not considered by Hatcher et al. (1994) concerns the 
possibility of individual variations, particularly the distinction between "surface dys- 
lexia" and "phonological dyslexia." Should this distinction be taken into account in 
designing remedial programs, with different approaches, targeting either the lexical or 
the nonlexical process, being required for different individuals? Or is there a single 
approach that is relevant for all dyslexic cases, notwithstanding the occurrence of 
individual variations? 
Treatment studies based on the modular standpoint have been reported by Broom 
and Doctor (1995a, 1995b). In the first study, an l 1-year-old dyslexic boy, D.E, 
who exhibited the features of "surface dyslexia" (reliance on letter-sound process- 
ing, difficulty with irregular words, homophone confusions, regularization errors, 
phonetically plausible spelling errors), was given training (using the method of "si- 
multaneous oral spelling") designed to establish visual representations of unknown 
irregular words. An individual case multiple baseline design was used to assess the 
effectiveness and generality of the training. Acquisition of specific words occurred, 
but there was little evidence of generalization to other words or tasks. The second 
study concerned another boy, S.P., who exhibited the features of "phonological dys- 
lexia" (errors and response delays in nonword reading, occurrence of visual and 
derivational errors). An attempt was made to direct treatment toward the nonlexical 
process by training the sounds attached to complex graphemes contained in unfa- 
miliar regular words. The treatment was successful in establishing grapheme- 
phoneme correspondences and there was evidence of generalization to the reading 
of new words and nonwords. 
Broom and Doctor's studies were based on the assumption that central orthographic 
processes possess the modular structure shown in Figure 1. Other investigations have 
produced somewhat different outcomes. For example, Seymour and Bunce (1994) 
reported a study of two dyslexic boys, aged about 10 years. R.C., who has already 
been mentioned in connection with peripheral visual accounts of dyslexia, presented 
the features of "surface dyslexia," including regularity effects, phonetic spelling, and 
reaction time anomalies (slowness of response, letter-by-letter reading). D.K. was con- 
sidered to be a case of "phonological dyslexia," showing a very large dissociation 
between word reading (9% error rate) and nonword reading (94% error rate). Both 
cases participated in an extended treatment study during which an attempt was made 
to establish the basis of orthographic structure. This involved highlighting of letter 
groups at two levels of complexity. In both cases, the interventions were successful 
in producing changes in reading and spelling, although the underlying contrast be- 
tween the cases (i.e., the "surface" and "phonological" dyslexia) remained. 
In the present context, the important point concerns the generalization of the 
effects of the treatments. The approach adopted acknowledged the proposed modular 
structure of the orthographic system and attempted the selective training of the four 

42 
Treatment of Childhood Dyslexia 
5 83 
components identified in Figure 1. This was done by devising instructional programs 
that emphasized recognition (reading) or production (spelling), and that used nonwords 
(nonlexical process) or real words (lexical process) as exemplars. The emphasis on 
orthographic segments produced a large amount of generalization, which extended 
beyond the specific vocabularies that were used, and beyond the system that was 
targeted. Thus, teaching that emphasized reading of words produced effects on, for 
example, the spelling of nonwords. 
These results suggest that an important issue in the evaluation of teaching ap- 
proaches concerns the degree to which the effects generalize across vocabularies and 
functions. This principle is at variance with the modular conception of the ortho- 
graphic process. It might, indeed, be seen as more in the spirit of the connectionist 
formulations (Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989) in which lexical and nonlexical reg- 
ularities are held to be encoded within a single network. 
42-4. ORTHOGRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT 
The analysis presented so far suggests that the remediation of childhood dyslexic 
disorders might most usefully focus on the central orthographic processes, and might 
aim to promote generalized learning by emphasizing orthographic segments that are 
related to phonology. However, this is a very general prescription that provides little 
guidance regarding either the content or the sequence of instruction. 
Several models of literacy acquisition have been formulated. They typically rep- 
resent development as a progression through a succession of "stages" in which new 
strategies or processes emerge. A common view is that reading starts with reliance 
on a visual "logographic" strategy but that, with the development of phonological 
awareness, an "alphabetic" strategy emerges that supports the capacity to read un- 
familiar forms (i.e., the nonlexical process), while at the same time providing a pho- 
nological basis for word recognition (the lexical process) (Gough & Hillinger, 1980; 
Ehri, 1992). 
One way of looking at this is to make a distinction between an early foundation 
level in reading development and a subsequent orthographic level (Seymour, in press). 
The foundation level involves acquisition of basic letter-sound knowledge and the 
formation of two primitive functions: (1) a logographic process of global word rec- 
ognition and storage; and (2) an alphabetic process of sequential letter-sound trans- 
lation. Later development depends on the formation of a central structure called the 
orthographic framework. This is built up step-by-step by a process of internal pho- 
nologically motivated redescription of data held in the logographic system. According 
to this view, the approach to treatment will differ according to level, focusing on 
specific components and phonemic awareness at the "foundation level," and on the 
construction of generalizable knowledge, perhaps based on rime segments, at the "or- 
thographic level."

42-5. CONCLUSIONS 
This chapter has explored implications of cognitive neuropsychological research for 
treatment of childhood literacy disorders. One possibility is that treatment might be 
directed toward the supposed cause of the difficulty. However, despite large research 
investments, the causal connections needed to justify peripheralist approaches to treat- 
ment are not yet established. The second possibility is that treatments should be di- 
rected toward the central orthographic processes themselves. These processes may 
have an internal modular structure, implying a need for (a) identification of the weak- 
ened process, and (b) direction of treatment toward that process. However, it is un- 
certain whether this degree of selectivity is possible or desirable. A conclusion is that 
progress may depend on the availability of a developmental account of the steps 
involved in construction of a central orthographic system, especially the achievement 
of linkage between orthographic and phonological segments.

The computer can be an effective clinical tool by incorporating what we know 
about aphasia treatment and computer programming. Computers can administer 
activities designed by clinicians, vary stimulus characteristics, adjust response 
requirements, present cues, and select tasks, all in response to patient perform- 
ance. Many supporters of computers as a clinical tool focus on relevant issues 
such as cost effectiveness and operational efficiency, but ignore the important 
issue of the efficacy of the treatment provided. This chapter reviews major factors 
that influence the development and use of computer therapy programs in aphasia 
rehabilitation. Attention is given to theories of aphasia and limitations inherent 
in the computer medium. The structure, content, and efficacy of aphasia treat- 
ment software as well as the role and responsibilities of the clinician are also 
discussed. 
Computers can be powerful clinical tools. They can administer activities designed by 
clinicians, vary stimulus characteristics, adjust response requirements, present cues, 
and select tasks, all in response to patient performance. Computers can increase the 
amount of time patients are involved in treatment and provide more treatment at lower 
cost. Performance data aggregated across patients and tasks can be used to create a 
database from which aphasia and the effects of therapy can be abstracted. Most

advocates of computers focus on their "appealing" featuresmcost effectiveness and 
operational efficiencymall but ignoring the important issue of the efficacy of treatment 
provided (Loverso, 1987). 
Many factors influence the development and use of computer therapy programs in 
rehabilitation (Kaasgaard & Lauritsen, 1995). Software for treating aphasia, however, 
is shaped primarily by (a) theories of aphasia, (b) limitations inherent in the computer 
medium, and (c) effectiveness of treatment software. 
43-1. MODELS OF APHASIA 
Effective therapy is individualized for each patient's abilities and disabilities. Explicit 
models of aphasia treatment (e.g., stimulation-facilitation, linguistic, modality, proc- 
essing, minor hemisphere, functional) should guide therapy structure and content 
(Chapey, 1994; Horner, Loverso, & Gonzalez Rothi, 1994). For example, treatment 
software based on the stimulation-facilitation model (Duffy, 1994) is repetitive and 
intensive, uses many different and meaningful stimuli, and elicits responses that are 
unforced and not corrected (Katz & Wertz, 1997). Treatment software developed from 
the linguistic model (Lesser, 1978) attempts to restore language by organizing stimuli 
according to linguistic systems (Guyard, Masson, & Quiniou, 1990; Loverso, Prescott, 
Selinger, Wheeler, & Smith, 1985). Treatment software developed from the modality 
model (Luria, 1973b; Weigl & Bierwisch, 1970) attempts to reorganize language and 
communication through intra- and intersystemic stimulation by pairing weak modal- 
ities with strong ones to "deblock" impaired performance (Scott & Byng, 1989). 
Horner and Loverso (1991) provided four major reasons for describing aphasia treat- 
ment in terms of explicit models: (1) facilitate the translation of linguistic, psycholin- 
guistic, neurolinguistic, and cognitive psychology literature into meaningful and ra- 
tional treatment techniques; (2) articulate the rationale of treatment; (3) help clinicians 
to evaluate the specific therapeutic technique; and (4) accumulate data from model- 
driven scientific investigations of therapy efficacy to help determine the validity of 
various theoretical models. Many modality-specific tasks and modality combinations 
can be reconstructed using modern multimedia computers to address the therapeutic 
needs of aphasic patients (Kosa, 1994; Roth, 1992a, 1996). 
43-2. LIMITATIONS 
OF COMPUTERS 
IN APHASIA THERAPY 
Contemporary computer treatment programs consist of a finite set of rules that are 
stated explicitly. From these rules, an algorithm (i.e., finite series of steps) is derived 
that specifies actions at any particular point during therapy. However, unlike most 
computer programs, aphasia therapy is governed by an evolving set of assumptions 
derived from a diverse body of research. Treatment provided by a computer is quan- 
tifiable and qualitatively different from treatment provided by a clinician. Although 

43 
Computers in Rehabilitation 
587 
many nonlinguistic communication behaviors are omitted (e.g., facial expressions, 
gestures, postures, spatial positions, clothing styles), the information generally ex- 
changed through computer-controlled modalities (visual and auditory, and, to a certain 
extent, kinesthetic) is often sufficient to support effective (though rarely comprehen- 
sive) language therapy. Although many large and complex computer treatment pro- 
grams provide systematic and reliable auditory and visual stimulation and accept and 
evaluate single-key, "pointing," and typing responses, a clinician can do much more 
by generating an infinite number of novel and relevant stimuli and by recognizing, 
evaluating, and modifying treatment in response to previously unacknowledged as- 
sociations and unanticipated responses. In this last aspect alone, computerized training 
will always be a subset of speech and language therapy provided by clinicians. 
43-2.1. Properties of Computer-Provided Treatment 
Bolter (1984) provided four properties of computers and computer programming in 
general that help clinicians describe limitations inherent in the application of com- 
puters to aphasia treatment: discrete, conventional, finite, and isolated. 
43-2.1.1. Discrete 
Because computers are discrete (i.e., digital), qualitative description and decisions are 
difficult for them. Events must first be separated into distinct, unconnected elements 
before they can be acted upon. However, treatment of communication disorders, such 
as aphasia, is recognized as a multilevel, simultaneously interactive behavioral 
exchange. Face-to-face communication is a complex act described as our "oldest and 
highest bandwidth technology" (Rheingold, 1991, p. 216). In summarizing his re- 
search on competing messages (i.e., the listener's perception of the meaning of words 
versus the message's emotion) during face-to-face communication, Mehrabian (1968) 
estimated that 55% of a message's affect (i.e., the emotional content) is communicated 
via facial cues, 38% is communicated vocally, but only 7% is communicated by the 
actual words. Although many individual language tasks can be programmed, applying 
computer technology appropriately to aphasia rehabilitation requires appreciation for 
the intricacies and interdependence of verbal (i.e., language) and nonverbal (e.g., ki- 
nesics, proxemics) channels of communication. 
43-2.1.2. Conventional 
Most computer programs apply predetermined rules to symbols that have no effect on 
the rules. While changing values of the symbols directs the outcome of the program, 
the rules themselves never change. However, although a consensus exists for some 
fundamental guidelines of aphasia treatment, all the rules are not known and those 
that are may not always be right (Rosenbek, 1979). Conventional computer-provided 
therapy programs, even those utilizing complex branching algorithms (e.g., Katz & 
Wertz, 1992), do not follow the clinical cycle of (a) administer treatment, (b) analyze 

588 
Volkbert M. Roth and Richard C. Katz 
performance, (c) modify treatment, and (d) readminister treatment, and therefore are 
not adequately responsive to the dynamics of patient performance. Programs utilizing 
artificial intelligence techniques, such as Guyard et al. (1990), more closely ap- 
proached the process employed by aphasia clinicians. 
43-2.1.3. Finite 
Programs incorporating dynamic rules or "fuzzy logic" to create additional rules of 
therapy as new data are received are unfortunately rare in aphasia rehabilitation. Al- 
though impressive for their flexibility and responsivness, these "expert systems" are 
generally limited in scope in the same manner as more conventional therapy programs. 
For example, Guyard et al. (1990) describe a prototype program that utilizes a lin- 
guistic model, the "mediation theory" (Gagnepain, 1982), to guide artificial intelli- 
gence techniques to provide patients with appropriately selected stimuli and detailed 
feedback. Each patient is presented with a unique sequence of exercises based on a 
diagnostic "patient portrait." However, the goal of the exercise described is deliber- 
ately restricted to improve accurate selection of the French language articles le and 
la by determining the gender of a list of nouns. Little if any research has described 
programs using artificial intelligence to treat areas of rehabilitation that are more 
complex or functional. 
Most currently available aphasia therapy software does not incorporate artificial 
intelligence programming. The rules and symbols that control these conventional 
computer-provided treatment programs are limited to those defined within the pro- 
gramming code. Unforeseen problems and associations do not result in creation of 
new rules and symbols. Therapy presents the opposite case. Not all therapeutically 
relevant behaviors are identified; those that have often vary in importance between 
patients and situations. Computer-assisted learning commonly defers decisions to soft- 
ware designers and programmers who are not physically present during the session, 
but must plan in advance how to handle the intervention and code these steps into a 
computer program (Odor, 1988). 
43-2.1.4. Isolated 
Problems and their solutions presented by computer exist within the computer's own 
parameters, apart from the real world. Problems are stated in a way that symbols can 
be manipulated to solve the problem by following an algorithm. This lack of "world 
knowledge" is perhaps the most significant impediment to comprehensive computer- 
provided treatment. Language tasks as presented by computers essentially differ from 
the meaningful, pragmatic setting in which communication occurs among people. 
Computers, therefore, only consider problems in which all the variables and rules are 
known ahead of time, and can be solved in a step-by-step procedure with a finite 
number of steps, much like a game of chess. Learning to solve linguistic riddles on 
a computer program may lead to better scores in a standardized aphasia test; improving 
communication, however, is quite another matter.

43-2.2. Characteristics of Aphasic Patients 
Patients vary according to age, gender, handedness, education, premorbid learning 
style, site of lesion, etiology, time post-onset, severity of aphasia, type of aphasia, 
coexisting communication problems, referral source, inpatient/outpatient status, family 
support, and other characteristics that have been determined to influence potential for 
recovery. For some authors (Katz, 1990; Kotten, 1989), the ability of aphasic people 
to use computers is also influenced by elements that are cognitive (e.g., attention, 
vigilance, memory, resource allocation), cybernetic (e.g., slow rise time, noise buildup, 
intermittent imperception), behavioral (e.g., discriminatory stimuli, chaining, extinc- 
tion), pragmatic (e.g., functionality, social status), and emotional (e.g., interest, rele- 
vance, novelty, enjoyment). In addition, pathologic characteristics commonly associ- 
ated with brain damage, such as perseveration and abstract attitude, can interfere with 
use of treatment software. These problems may affect motivation, independence, prag- 
matics, and interpersonal relations, ultimately diminishing potential for recovery, suc- 
cess of treatment, and quality of life for aphasic patients. Computer treatment pro- 
grams rarely attend to these factors. 
43-2.3. Task Structure 
Language therapy presented on computer is usually organized in one of four nonex- 
clusive formats: stimulation, drill and practice, simulation, and tutorial (Katz, 1995). 
43-2.3.1. Stimulation 
As mentioned earlier, stimulation-facilitation activities permit the patient to respond 
quickly and usually correctly over time for the purpose of achieving and stabilizing 
the underlying processes or skills, rather than learning a new set of responses. The 
process, not a specific response, is the focus of the task. Stimuli are selected not for 
informational content, but for characteristics affecting their processing, such as length, 
complexity, and number of critical elements. Stimulation tasks can be programmed 
on computers rather easily as intervention can be minimal (Mills, 1982). 
43-2.3.2. Drill and Practice 
The goal of drill-and-practice tasks generally is to learn a specific set of (functional) 
responses. Stimuli are particular to each patient (e.g., family names, favorite foods, 
home address), so convenient authoring or editing capability is required for this format 
of computer therapy (Roth, 1992c). Patients commonly experience a higher error rate 
with drill-and-practice tasks than with stimulation tasks. Since computer programs 
typically offer a limited variety of cues, a clinician must be prepared to intervene, 
especially during complex tasks. Because specific responses are the focus, drill-and- 
practice programs are usually convergent tasks (Seron, Deloche, Moulard, & Rouselle, 
1980). 

590 
Volkbert M. Roth and Richard C. Katz 
43-2.3.3. Simulation 
Simulation tasks are also called, "microworlds." They present a structured environ- 
ment with an intentional problem. The patient must often use elements within the 
simulated environment to solve the problem. Microworlds provide the opportunity to 
design divergent therapy tasks with various solutions to real-life problems. Although 
microworlds require complex programming, the skills patients acquire from using 
them seem more likely to generalize to real-world situations than gains achieved 
through more traditional formats as microworlds more closely approximate variables 
found in the real world. The focus of simulations is to develop an effective (problem- 
solving) strategy (Crerar, Ellis, & Dean, 1996). 
43-2.3.4. Tutorial 
Simply "teaching" aphasic patients in the same manner as new information is taught 
in a classroom is rarely successful. However, early work by Eisenson (1973) and others 
suggests that aphasic patients are best served by modifying their communicative en- 
vironment. Computerized tutorials can provide important information, such as tech- 
niques to facilitate communication (Pulvermtiller & Roth, 1991) or explanations to 
foster greater empathy and patience (Brumfitt, 1995) to family members, friends, and 
others who influence the aphasic person's world to help improve the aphasic patient's 
independence and satisfaction. Non-computer-based tasks, such as PACE (Steiner, 
1993) and PACT (Roth, 1989), are suitable therapeutic follow-up activities to such 
tutorials. 
43-3. 
EFFICACY 
OF TREATMENT 
SOFTWARE 
Treatment software can be viewed along a continuum of complexity that represents 
salient features of therapy, including those discussed earlier (i.e., aphasia models, 
program properties, patient characteristics, task structure). At one end of the contin- 
uum, simple, isolated drills are utilized in the same manner as therapy workbooks to 
improve specific language-related skills, such as identifying pictures of objects named 
verbally by the clinician (Mills, 1982). Toward the far end of the continuum, series 
of integrated activities utilize complex branching algorithms (Katz & Wertz, 1997, 
1992), multiple tasks, or artificial intelligence (Guyard et al., 1990) to provide a com- 
prehensive approach to improving language ability and communication (Pulvermtiller 
& Roth, 1993; Roth, 1992b). 
Although general discussions of efficacy of aphasia rehabilitation are available 
elsewhere (Caprez, 1992; Wertz, 1995), the issue is central to the examination of 
the validity of computer-provided aphasia treatment and deserves mention. Aphasia 
treatment is the systematic application of conditions designed to improve language 
ability and communicative competence. Treatment efficacy considers whether out- 
comes are improved as a result of a specific intervention (McGlynn, 1996). According 

43 
Computers in Rehabilitation 
591 
to Rosenbek (1995), efficacy is improvement resulting from treatment applied in a 
rigidly controlled design when treatment and no-treatment conditions are compared. 
Wolfe (1987) found that early reports of computerized aphasia treatment did not pro- 
vide explicit models of rehabilitation (e.g., linguistic models) from which the software 
could be evaluated. In an extensive review of the literature, Robinson (1990) reported 
that the efficacy of computerized treatment for aphasia as well as for other cognitive 
disorders had not been demonstrated. The research studies reviewed suffered from 
inappropriate experimental designs, insufficient statistical analysis, and other deficien- 
cies. Since Robinson's critique, a number of studies have reported the effect of par- 
ticular computerized interventions (Crerar et al., 1996; Katz & Wertz, in press, 1992; 
Loverso, Prescott, & Selinger, 1992). The following is a description of five areas 
illustrating the development of computer-provided aphasia treatment. 
43-3.1. Reading and Writing 
Even before the availability of multimedia computer systems, computers were viewed 
as an appropriate medium for treating reading and writing problems. Most aphasic 
people have these problems. As communicative acts, reading and writing are usually 
done alone, and having greater interpersonal distance, are socially appropriate to prac- 
tice in isolation. Reading requires minimal response by the patient, thereby simplifying 
software development and hardware requirements. The independent use of computers 
to provide reading and writing treatment outside of the traditional treatment session 
can increase the total time a patient is involved in therapeutic activities. The clinician, 
no longer directly providing reading and writing treatment, can then use the time freed 
during traditional treatment sessions to focus on auditory comprehension, verbal ex- 
pression, and other components of face-to-face communication (Pulvermtiller & Roth, 
1991, 1993). 
43-3.1.1. Reading Comprehension 
Early reports of reading treatment software included mostly simple drills converted 
for the computer. Scott & Byng (1989) tested the effectiveness of a program de- 
signed to improve reading comprehension of similar sounding words (homophones) 
for a 24-year-old woman who suffered traumatic head injury and underwent subse- 
quent left temporal lobe surgery that resulted in aphasic symptoms as well as sur- 
face dyslexia and surface dysgraphia. The patient demonstrated particular difficulty 
with homophones. The computer program designed to treat this problem was based 
on an information-processing model. After using the program over 10 weeks, the 
subject improved in recognition and comprehension of treated (p < .001) and un- 
treated (p < .002) homophones used in sentences. Improvement was also demon- 
strated on recognition of isolated homophones that were treated (p < .05) and on 
defining isolated treated (p < .03) and untreated homophones (p < .02). Recogni- 
tion of isolated untreated homophones and spelling of irregular words showed no 
improvement. 

592 
Volkbert M. Roth and Richard C. Katz 
Katz & Wertz (1997) conducted a longitudinal group study based on earlier research 
(Katz & Wertz, 1992) to investigate the effects of computer-provided reading com- 
prehension activities on language performance for chronic aphasic adults. Fifty-five 
aphasic adults were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: 78 hours of com- 
puter reading treatment, 78 hours of computer stimulation, or no treatment. Computer 
stimulation software consisted of nonverbal games and cognitive rehabilitation tasks. 
Standardized language measures were administered to all subjects at entry and after 
3 and 6 months. Significant improvement (p < .01) over the 26 weeks occurred on 
five language measures for the computer reading treatment group, on one language 
measure for the computer stimulation group, and on none of the language measures 
for the no-treatment group. Results suggest that computerized reading treatment can 
(a) be administered with minimal assistance from a clinician, (b) generalize to non- 
computer language performance, and (c) be efficacious for chronic aphasic patients. 
Additionally, improvement resulted from the language content of the software and not 
the stimulation provided by using computers. 
43-3.1.2. Writing 
Most computer programs designed to improve writing substitute typing for writing. 
Selinger, Prescott, and Katz (1987) found no significant differences on standardized 
graphic tasks when comparing writing and typing performance for seven left 
hemisphere-damaged subjects. Several investigators have incorporated complex 
branching algorithms in computerized writing programs to provide multilevel inter- 
vention for spelling (Seron et al., 1980), written confrontation naming (Katz, Wertz, 
Davidoff, Shubitowski, & Devitt, 1989), and written sentence completion (Glisky, 
Schlacter, & Tulving, 1986). Deloche, Dordain, and Kremin (1993) developed software 
to treat oral and written modality differences in confrontation naming for two aphasic 
subjects, a surface dysgraphic and a conduction aphasic. The intervention focused on 
written naming from the keyboard. Both subjects maintained improvements 1 year 
following therapy. 
43-3.2. Verbal Output 
A number of early efforts demonstrated how computers could be used to assist aphasic 
patients experiencing dysnomia and other verbal problems. Van de Sandt-Koenderman 
(1994) described a computer program, "Multicue," that is designed to help aphasic 
patients identify and select self-cuing and compensatory strategies for word-finding 
problems. A picture is presented in the upper-left quarter of the computer screen and 
the patient's goal is to find the appropriate name. If the patient does not know the 
name, various cues can be selected (e.g., word meaning, word form, sentence com- 
pletion) to help the patient retrieve the word. The goal of the program is to allow the 
patient to evaluate and practice several word-finding strategies. Further study is under 
way to assess the effectiveness of Multicue. 

43 
Computers in Rehabilitation 
593 
Early attempts to develop a computerized "speech prosthetic device" for people 
with aphasia met with limited success due in part to the existing state of computer 
technology (e.g., Colby, Christinaz, Parkison, Graham, & Karpf (1981). Recent at- 
tempts appear more hopeful. Lingraphica is an integrated, computerized communi- 
cation system that combines spoken words, pictures (icons), and text processing. It is 
an extension of the C-VIC system (Computerized Visual Communication) developed 
as an alternative mode of communication for severely impaired aphasic people. The 
empirical evidence to support the efficacy of C-VIC was collected in a series of single- 
case studies (Steele, Weinrich, Kleczewska, Wertz, & Carlson, 1987; Weinrich et al., 
1989). Lingraphica and C-VIC are the current results of these efforts. Aphasic patients 
use a mouse device to select one of several icons, each of which represents a general 
category. The selected icon then "opens up" to reveal pictures of the items within 
the selected category. After selecting the desired item, the picture is added to a se- 
quence of other selected pictures; this "string" of pictures represents the message. 
The message can be read via the sequence of icons, words printed below the sequence, 
or, in some cases, heard through digitized speech. Much attention is given to the 
selection of icons. Weinrich et al. (1989) reported that concrete icons were learned 
and generalized faster than abstract icons, but neither type of icon generalized well 
to new situations. Steele et al. (1987) reported improvement on expressive and recep- 
tive tasks for a globally impaired aphasic subject using C-VIC, although communi- 
cation through more traditional modes (e.g., speech) remained unchanged. Conversely, 
Weinrich, McCall, Weber, Thomas, and Thornburg (1995) trained two Broca's aphasic 
subjects in the production of locative prepositional phrases and S-V-O sentences on 
C-VIC and reported that their verbal ability improved considerably. Clearly, further 
single-subject and group research utilizing standardized measurements is needed to 
test the effectiveness of new computer technology adapted to the communicative needs 
of aphasic patients. 
43-3.3. Training at Home and in a Self-Help Context 
Athough not intended specifically as a treatment efficacy study, Petheram (1996) as- 
sessed the feasibility and acceptability of computers for therapy by patients in their 
homes. Computer systems were installed in the homes of 10 aphasic patients. Therapy 
software automatically varied the level of difficulty of the treatment material for each 
patient. Although patients demonstrated a wide variation in performance, the author 
reported that their extensive use of the computer supports the notion of therapeutic 
application of home computer systems. In a similar fashion, multimedia computers 
have been used in self-help groups of aphasic people (Roth, 1996). In Germany, for 
example, the first two language-training computers (with digital speech input and 
output) were donated in 1990. Self-help groups in metropolitan and provincial areas 
had an early opportunity to gain experience using computers outside of rehabilitation 
centers. For example, Roth and Sch6nle (1992) followed a "systemic" approach. 
Sessions incorporating a PC were arranged for an aphasic father (39 years old, 

594 
Volkbert M. Roth and Richard C. Katz 
polytrauma following a car accident) and his family at their home. In addition to a 
version of the Stachowiak program (1992), a second program, WEGE (Roth, 1992a), 
was used that focused on understanding everyday language. The authoring system 
allowed for the introduction of new material designed to measure performance during 
pleasant, nonstressful family sessions at the computer. Role-playing activities and 
drawings from the sessions were stored on the multimedia computer. The aphasic 
father participated (minimally) in the overall production, but he could run through the 
stored activities repeatedly when they were part of exercises such as matching audible 
and written language. The gains made during half a year of daily training facilitated 
initially by his wife and two students, supervised by a professional speech-and-family 
therapist, were significant (Roth & Sch6nle, 1992). Other aphasic people occasionally 
participated, working with the aphasic father, who in turn responded to tasks presented 
by the language training program. 
Many people suffering the mild residual effects of aphasia will no longer be able 
to work productively in a paying job, but still want to improve their ability to com- 
municate. Training with a speech-language therapy computer in a self-help group 
can be a way to provide this care efficiently. Programs commonly used by German 
self-help aphasia groups include LingWare/STACH (Stachowiak, 
1993) and 
NeueWEGE/MODAKT (Zechner & Roth, 1996). An evaluation study in five German 
self-help groups (of an estimated total of 20 computer-user groups) is being prepared 
by Tollktihn at the University of Leipzig (section F6rderp~idagogik) concentrating on 
the aspect of user acceptability for different programs and types of tasks that use 
familiar pictures and voices from the patient's own environment. Integrating significant 
others in the rehabilitation process has been advocated by many authors. Today's 
multimedia PC technology offers new ways to do this. In the last few years, the self- 
help movement has started to offer patients and their families a chance to see for 
themselves how technology can help them communicate (Roth, 1994). 
In Sweden, Magnusson (1996) described a "telematic pilot study" at the University 
of Karlstad funded by the Foundation for Communication Research in which "video- 
telephony" is used as a therapy tool for communicatively impaired patients who live 
in remote areas of Sweden where speech therapy is not readily available. The project 
(called "VITSI") includes a 3-year project to provide remote therapy using both visual 
and auditory signals ("videoconferencing") to people with aphasia and to evaluate 
their attitudes about this form of support. Twenty-six aphasic adults are participating 
in the study, all of whom have had prior conventional therapy and most of whom 
have prior experience with computer-based therapy. Sessions are 45 minutes long and 
are scheduled once every 2 weeks in order to accommodate all 26 participants. In 
addition to individualized therapy programs, surveys and interviews will be used to 
evaluate the response of the participants to this mode of treatment. 
43-3.4. Artificial Intelligence 
Guyard et al. (1990) introduced a new stage in the development of treatment software 
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) programming and computer-assisted instruc- 

43 
Computers in Rehabilitation 
595 
tion (CAI) for the rehabilitation of aphasic patients. Barr and Geigenbaum (1982) 
described a union between AI and CAI as "Intelligent CAI" (ICAI). ICAI can expand 
the scope, responsiveness, and flexibility of aphasia therapy software so that a com- 
puter program would determine the type, sequence, and rate of stimuli presented based 
on evaluation of the patient's responses. Although valued in education, ICAI has met 
limited success in aphasia rehabilitation primarily due to two factors: the heterogeneity 
of the aphasic population and the complexity of aphasia therapy (Katz, 1990). 
43-3.5. Microworlds 
Roth (1992b, 1995) and Gadler and Zechner (1992) each described computer- 
simulated worlds (NeueWEGE and AUSWEGE, respectively) in which patients, 
guided by their clinicians, explore a microworld, making decisions, "traveling," and 
taking chances without any real physical or interpersonal risks. Messmer and Roth 
(1996) and Norosel and Roth (1997) developed a WEGE version running under Win- 
dows 95, opening aphasia therapy software up to current technological possibilities 
such as PC to PC linking via ISDN, integration of video. Crerar and Ellis (1995) 
described the "Microworld Project," a computer system based on sound neuropsy- 
chologic and psycholinguistic theory and designed to treat sentence processing im- 
pairments. Concepts such as agent, action, object, and spatial relations were manip- 
ulated to improve sentence comprehension. A series of experiments (Crerar & Ellis, 
1995; Crerar et al., 1996) demonstrated improvement in chronic aphasic subjects after 
a relatively short duration of treatment. Other attempts at developing microworlds and 
other therapeutic virtual reality environments are described by Brodin and Magnusson 
(1993) and others. Much is expected from this approach as computer and communi- 
cation technologies continue to develop and interact. 
43-4. CONCLUSION 
We reviewed three factors central to the development of effective computer-provided 
aphasia treatment: aphasia models, technological limitations, and published research. 
These three factors influence the way clinicians perceive the role of computers in 
treatment. Computers can be effective clinical tools for clinicians who incorporate 
what is known about aphasia, computers, and the state of the art. Those who are 
concerned that researchers are advocating computers in place of clinicians are missing 
our point. In the studies described in this chapter, clinicians selected and tested the 
patients, designed treatment plans, designed and modified treatment tasks, trained the 
patients to use the computers, and measured treatment efficacy. Computers and treat- 
ment software, like all tools, should extend the abilities of the clinician, allowing 
clinicians to intervene when skills, experience, and flexibility are required. Rather 
than emphasize what computers can or cannot do better than clinicians, our focus 
should be on an intelligent division of labor between computers and clinicians, a 
combination that can do more than either alone. For example, Stachowiak (1993) 

596 
Volkbert M. Roth and Richard C. Katz 
reported that daily multimedia computer-provided supplemental treatment led to ad- 
ditional gains in therapy for aphasic patients receiving a minimum of 3 hours a week 
of conventional treatment. 
A real danger comes from a failure to appreciate the scope and depth of clinical 
work. How many symbols and algorithms do we need to represent aphasia therapy? 
A program that accurately represents clinician-provided therapy would quickly exceed 
the capacity of most computers. Treatment software will always be an imperfect re- 
flection of clinician-provided therapy, but, by improving the software, clinicians and 
programmers will learn more about how and why treatment works. In the best tradition 
of scientific and rehabilitative efforts, aphasiologists can work together to shape this 
new tool of technology for the development of their professions and the benefit of all 
patients. Controlled treatment studies can assist clinicians in developing treatment 
models and tasks that translate to the computer medium by identifying the salient 
features of treatment and the strengths and limitations of the computer.

CHAPTER 44 
Computational Transcript Analysis 
and Language Disorders 
Brian MacWhinney 
Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 
The errors and omissions found in aphasic language production are a rich source 
of information about how language is processed in the brain. However, in order 
to fully exploit this type of data, we need a consistent methodology for elicitation, 
recording, transcription, and analysis. One such framework is provided by tools 
developed for the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) Project. 
This paper examines those tools in the light of the development of research meth- 
odology from the precomputer period into the current period of connectivity and 
exploratory reality. Although these tools were originally developed for the anal- 
ysis of language acquisition data, they can be readily adapted to the study of 
language disorders. 
When asked to describe simple pictures or to recite simple narratives, aphasics often 
illustrate a wide variety of paraphasias, word-finding difficulties, phonological dis- 
fluencies, and grammatical errors. These errors and omissions provide us with two 
important windows into the functioning of language in the brain. First, by studying 
the various types of errors and omissions in psychological and linguistic terms and 
by comparing their relative frequencies, we can learn a great deal about how aphasia 
affects the basic mechanisms of language processing. For example, the study of 
omissions of markers like the plural on the noun or the past tense on the verb has

Brian MacWhinney 
been useful in developing our understanding of production processes in aphasia 
(MacWhinney & Osman-Sfigi, 1991; Menn & Obler, 1990). 
Error patterns also offer us potential information about clinical groupings. By look- 
ing at differential patterns of errors and omissions, we can distinguish the telegraphic 
production patterns found in agrammatism or Broca's aphasia, the more verbose and 
error-prone patterns characterizing Wernicke's aphasia, the exclusively lexical error 
patterns characterizing anomia, and the more exclusively phonetic error patterns found 
in dysarthria and apraxia of speech. These patterns in aphasia can also be compared 
with possibly similar language patterns in the speech of people with schizophrenia, 
right-hemisphere damage, frontal lobe damage, Alzheimer's disease, and other neural 
disorders. We can then couple this information with additional information from com- 
prehension, neural imaging, and other methodologies to advance claims regarding the 
structuring of language in the brain. 
Unfortunately, the study of production errors and clinical patterns in production 
has often been a rather hit-or-miss endeavor. Because there is no standardized refer- 
ence database of production data, it is difficult to evaluate the relative position of new 
clinical samples and data from single subjects. There are a number of standard diag- 
nostic tests available for the study of aphasia, but the actual transcripts from these 
tests have not been collected in a publicly available repository and organized in a 
fashion that permits easy comparison between individual subjects and the larger da- 
tabase. 
There are some fairly good reasons why this database has not yet been developed. 
Although it is extremely easy to collect production data, it is much more difficult to 
analyze these data in a scientifically consistent manner. Many laboratories have dozens 
and dozens of transcripts of disordered speech sitting in paper repositories or stored 
on computer disks. It is easy to turn on a tape recorder or videotape recorder and 
build up a huge library of hundreds of hours of tapes. However, transcribing, coding, 
and analyzing hours upon hours of recordings involves an enormous time commit- 
ment. If the work spent doing this transcription is to be meaningful, we need to set 
standards to guarantee the comparability of data across subjects, laboratories, proto- 
cols, and transcription formats. 
44-1. THE CHILD LANGUAGE DATA EXCHANGE 
(CHILDES) SYSTEM 
Fortunately, there already is a well-developed framework for the process of database 
formation and analysis that can be directly applied to the study of aphasia. This is the 
system of programs and codes developed by the Child Language Data Exchange 
(CHILDES) Project (Higginson & MacWhinney, 1990, 1994; MacWhinney, 1991a, 
199 lb, 1993, 1994b, 1994c, 1995, in press; MacWhinney & Snow, 1985; 1990). The 
CHILDES project has been directed by the author in collaboration with Catherine 
Snow of Harvard University and has been supported since 1987 by the National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

It is important to realize that, although the CHILDES system was originally de- 
veloped for use in the study of child language data, we took care early on to make 
sure that the system would also be applicable to the analysis of aphasic language data. 
We did this by emphasizing the development of tools for the analysis of speech errors 
and by including data from both children and adults with language disorders. At this 
point, the acronym CHILDES is largely a historical relic, since the system is being 
used not only by child language researchers, but also by discourse analysts, sociolin- 
guists, speech pathologists, aphasiologists, computer scientists, and applied linguists 
studying second language acquisition. 
Sometimes researchers who are unfamiliar with CHILDES think of it only as a 
database. However, in order to develop a useful and consistent database, we had to 
construct a system based on three integrated components: 
1. CHAT is the system for discourse notation and coding. This system includes 
detailed conventions for marking all sorts of conversational features, such as 
false starts, drawling, overlaps, interruptions, errors, and so on. This system 
was developed over the course of 6 years with continual input from language 
researchers. This standard transcription system is used for all the data in the 
database. 
2. CLAN is the set of computer programs for searching and manipulating the 
database. Rather than focusing on canned analyses or rigid clinical packages, 
these programs provide the user with a tool kit of analytic possibilities that 
can be combined to fit a specific research agenda. Most recently, the programs 
have been extended to provide tools for linking transcripts to digitized audio 
and video records. 
3. Database. Finally, the system includes the database itself, with data donated 
to the language community from more than 40 major projects in English and 
additional data from Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, 
Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Mambila, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese, 
Russian, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, and Ukrainian. Along with data from 
normally developing children, there are data from children with language 
disorders, adult aphasics, second language learners, and early childhood 
bilinguals. In essence, the database is simply a set of standard text files of 
transcripts of conversational interactions. In a few cases, the computerized 
transcript is accompanied by digitized audio and even video, but the vast 
majority of the corpora have only transcripts without audio or video. 
The system has been used as the basis of nearly 400 published research studies in 
the areas of language disorders, aphasia, second language learning, computational 
linguistics, literacy development, narrative structures, formal linguistic theory, and 
adult sociolinguistics. 
There are two major modes in which researchers have used the CHILDES system. 
The first mode focuses on the examination of patterns in the existing database. 
Researchers operating in this first mode need to learn the basic functions of the 
CLAN programs for searching across corpora. However, they are mostly interested in 

602 
Brian MacWhinney 
understanding the shape of the database and the nature of the various existing corpora. 
They may be interested in studying the development of specific syntactic constructions 
or parts of speech, such as questions, prepositions, plurals, or demonstratives. To study 
these issues, they typically use the basic search and tabulation programs in CLAN. 
Because there are fewer data on child language disorders and even fewer still on adult 
aphasics, this mode of research is somewhat less attractive currently for the areas of 
developmental language disorders and aphasiology. 
The second mode of research uses the CLAN programs and the CHAT transcript 
format to transcribe and analyze new data. Workers operating in this second mode 
usually develop their own coding schemes and analysis routines designed to address 
project-specific questions. When researchers have completed their work, they then 
contribute their transcripts as new corpora for the database. Researchers operating in 
this mode are particularly interested in understanding the ways in which the various 
CLAN programs can help them address their current research needs. In order to max- 
imize their use of the CLAN programs, they also need to understand the various 
alternative ways in which one can use the CHAT transcription system. 
Each of the three components of the CHILDES system was designed from the 
beginning to be useful across languages. The crosslinguistic focus of the CHILDES 
system is not just an optional methodological nicety; it is conceptually central. And 
this centrality holds equally well for both child language and aphasiology. In both of 
these fields, certain prominent theories make strong claims about universals of gram- 
mar (Chomsky, 1965), conceptual structure (Bickerton, 1984; Slobin, 1985), or sen- 
tence processing (Frazier, 1987). Proponents of these universalist theories often argue 
that these abilities are located in specific brain modules that can be damaged in specific 
ways (Friederici & Frazier, 1992; Grodzinsky, 1990; Warrington & McCarthy, 1987). 
In the simplest case, these accounts would claim that all language is organized in the 
same basic way and that the patterns of dissociation we find across languages (Paradis 
& Lebben, 1987) should be basically the same. An alternative view stresses the im- 
portance of language differences in determining patterns of errors and omissions in 
aphasia (Bates, Wulfeck, & MacWhinney, 1991). These between-language differences 
are then attributed to variation in cue distribution (MacWhinney & Bates, 1989) or 
social interaction (Schieffelin & Ochs, 1987). In order to understand how both uni- 
versals and particulars interact in language learning and language loss, researchers 
must adopt a crosslinguistic perspective. Ideally, we will also want to maximize com- 
parability across languages by settling on a standardized set of pictures and other tasks 
for the elicitation of language production. 
Before we begin a more detailed examination of the current status of the CHILDES 
system, it may be useful to step back a bit to look at the ways in which the meth- 
odology for the study of spontaneous language production has evolved historically. 
This historical overview can help us gain some perspective on the status of our current 
methodological advantages and the ways in which changes in methodology are linked 
to changes in theory. Starting in ancient times and continuing up through the present, 
we can distinguish five major periods. In each of these periods, our understanding of 
the nature of language has been closely linked to the nature of the methodology that 

44 
Computational Transcript Analysis 
603 
has been available for studying language performance. During each of these periods, 
the methodology used for the study of language acquisition has been essentially the 
same as the methodology used for the study of language disorders. 
44-2. FIVE METHODOLOGICAL PERIODS 
44-2.1. Period 1: Naive Speculation 
The first attempt to understand the process of language development appears in 
a remarkable passage from the Confessions of Saint Augustine (Augustine, 397). In 
this passage, Augustine actually claims that he remembered how he had learned lan- 
guage: 
This I remember; and have since observed how I learned to speak. It was not that my elders 
taught me words (as, soon after, other learning) in any set method; but I, longing by cries 
and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express my thoughts, that so I might 
have my will, and yet unable to express all I willed or to whom I willed, did myself, by the 
understanding which Thou, my God, gavest me, practise the sounds in my memory. When 
they named anything, and as they spoke turned towards it, I saw and remembered that they 
called what they would point out by the name they uttered. And that they meant this thing, 
and no other, was plain from the motion of their body, the natural language, as it were, of 
all nations, expressed by the countenance, glances of the eye, gestures of the limbs, and 
tones of the voice, indicating the affections of the mind as it pursues, possesses, rejects, or 
shuns. And thus by constantly hearing words, as they occurred in various sentences, I col- 
lected gradually for what they stood; and, having broken in my mouth to these signs, I 
thereby gave utterance to my will. Thus I exchanged with those about me these current signs 
of our wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human life, yet depending 
on parental authority and the beck of elders (p. 4). 
Augustine's fanciful recollection of his own language acquisition remained the 
high-water mark for child language studies through the Middle Ages and even the 
Enlightenment. However, Augustine's recollection technique is no longer of much 
interest to us, since few of us believe in the accuracy of recollections from infancy, 
even if they come from saints. 
44-2.2 Period 2" Diaries and Biographies 
The second major technique for the study of language production was pioneered by 
Charles Darwin. Using note cards and field books to track the distribution of hundreds 
of species and subspecies in places like the Galapagos and Indonesia, Darwin was 
able to collect an impressive body of naturalistic data in support of his views on 
natural selection and evolution. In his study of gestural development in his son, Dar- 
win (1877) showed how these same tools for naturalistic observation could be adapted 
to the study of human development. By taking detailed daily notes, Darwin showed 
how researchers could build diaries that could then be converted into biographies 
documenting virtually any aspect of human development. Following Darwin's lead, 
scholars such as Ament, Preyer, Gvozdev, Szuman, Stern, Ponyori, Kenyeres, and 

604 
Brian MacWhinney 
44-2.3. Period 
Leopold created monumental biographies detailing the language development of their 
own children. 
Darwin's biographical technique also had its effects on the study of adult aphasia. 
Following this tradition, studies of the language of particular patients have been pre- 
sented by Low (1931), Pick (1913, 1971), Wernicke (1874), and many others. 
3: Transcripts 
The limits of the diary technique were always quite apparent. Even the most highly 
trained observer could not keep pace with the rapid flow of normal speech production. 
The emergence of the tape recorder in the 1950s provided a way around these limi- 
tations and ushered in the third period of observational studies. This period was char- 
acterized by projects in which groups of investigators collected large data sets of tape 
recordings from several subjects across a period of 2 or 3 years. As long as there was 
sufficient funding available, these tapes were transcribed either by hand or by type- 
writer. Typewritten copies were reproduced by ditto master, stencil, or mimeograph. 
Comments and tallies were written into the margins of these copies and new, even 
less legible, copies were then made by thermal production of new ditto masters. Each 
investigator devised a project-specific system of transcription and project-specific 
codes. As we began to compare handwritten and typewritten transcripts, problems in 
transcription methodology, coding schemes, and cross-investigator reliability became 
more apparent. 
44-2.4. Period 4: Computers 
Just as these new problems were coming to light, a major technological opportunity 
was emerging in the shape of the powerful, affordable microcomputer. Microcomputer 
word-processing systems and database programs allowed researchers to enter transcript 
data into computer files, which could then be easily duplicated, edited, and analyzed 
by standard data-processing techniques. In 1981, when the CHILDES Project was first 
conceived, researchers basically thought of these computer systems as large notepads. 
Although researchers were aware of the ways in which databases could be searched 
and tabulated, the full analytic and comparative power of the computer systems them- 
selves was not yet fully understood. 
44-2.5. Period 5" Connectivity and Exploratory Reality 
Since 1981, the world of computers has gone through a series of remarkable revolu- 
tions, each introducing new opportunities and challenges. The processing power of 
the home computer now dwarfs the power of the mainframe of the 1980s, new ma- 
chines are now shipped with built-in audiovisual capabilities, and devices such as CD- 
ROMs, DAT tapes, and optical disks offer enormous storage capacity at reasonable 
prices. This new hardware has opened up the possibility for multimedia access to 
transcripts of aphasic language production. In effect, a transcript is now the starting 
point for a new Exploratory Reality in which the whole interaction is accessible 

44

through the transcript in terms of both full audio and video images. For those who 
are just now becoming familiar with this new technology, Table 1 summarizes some 
of the relevant pieces of hardware and software options. 
Most recently, microcomputers all across the world have become interconnected 
through a global high-speed network called the Internet that supports the movement 
of all sorts of information, including text, sound, and video. This connectivity between 
computers is matched by an increasing interactivity between the operating system and 
individual programs. The user can record a sound in one program, take it immediately 
to another for detailed acoustic analysis, and then to a third for database storage. 
Together, these new hardware and software developments have led to an enormous 
increase in interconnectivity between computers, between programs, and between re- 
searchers. We are just now beginning to understand the potential consequences of this 
connectivity for researchers. 
From this quick survey of the development of tools for language analysis, we see 
that the possibilities for careful, detailed analysis of production data have markedly 
widened in the last few years. The methodological tools that are now available far 
exceed those of previous eras. What we lack now in the field of aphasiology are not 
the conceptual or computational tools, but the organizational commitment that will be

needed to push forward the development of a standardized database. In order to en- 
vision the possibilities that are open for constructing a database for aphasia, let us 
look at the shape of the current database for first and second language development 
and for child language disorders. 
44-3. THE DATABASE 
The first major tool in the CHILDES workbench is the database itself. Through 
CD-ROM or FTP, researchers now have access to the results of nearly a hundred 
major research projects in 20 languages. Using this database, a researcher can test a 
vast range of empirical hypotheses directly against either the whole database or some 
logically defined subset. The database includes a wide variety of language samples 
from a wide range of ages and situations. Almost all of the data represent real spon- 
taneous interactions in natural contexts, rather than some simple list of sentences or 
test results. Although more than half of the data come from English speakers, there 
is also a significant component of non-English data. 
Until 1989, nearly all of the data in the CHILDES database were from normally 
developing children. However, recent additions to the database have included several 
major corpora from children with language disorders. These include data from Down's 
syndrome contributed by Nahid Hooshyar, Jean Rondal, and Helen Tager-Flusberg; 
data from autistic children contributed by Helen Tager-Flusberg; data from SLI (Spe- 
cific Language Impairment) contributed by Lynn Bliss, Patricia Hargrove, Gina Conti- 
Ramsden, and Larry Leonard; and data from children with articulatory disorders con- 
tributed by Susan Fosnot-Meyers and the Ulm University Clinic. 
In the area of adult aphasia, the database includes two large corpora. The first is a 
set of conversational interviews with 42 aphasic patients during the period of recovery 
from stroke donated by Audrey Holland. The second is a collection of interview and 
picture description data from aphasic speakers of English, German, Hungarian, Chi- 
nese, and Italian donated by Elizabeth Bates and her colleagues. One of the major 
priorities for the CHILDES project is the inclusion of additional data on both child- 
hood language disorders and aphasia during the coming years. We are aware of a 
variety of additional computerized corpora in the area of adult aphasia (Menn & Obler, 
1990; Paradis & Lebben, 1987) and we hope to be able to convince researchers in 
aphasiology of the importance of making these data sets publicly available. 
All of the major corpora have been formatted into the CHAT standard and have 
been checked for syntactic accuracy. The total size of the database is now approxi- 
mately 180 million characters (180 MB). The corpora are divided into six major 
directories: English, non-English, narratives, books, language impairments, and bilin- 
gual acquisition. In addition to the basic texts on language acquisition, there is a 
database from the Communicative Development Inventory (Dale, Bates, Reznick, & 
Morisset, 1989) and a bibliographic database for Child Language studies (Higginson 
& MacWhinney, 1990). 
Membership in CHILDES is open. Members are listed in a standard database and 
receive electronic messages through the info-childes@andrew.cmu.edu electronic 

44 
Computational Transcript Analysis 
607 
bulletin board. In order to be officially included in the info-childes electronic mailing 
list and database, researchers should send E-mail to childes @cmu.edu with their com- 
puter address, postal address, affiliations, and phone number. Users are asked to abide 
by the rules of the system. In particular, they should abide by the stated wishes of 
the contributors of the data. Any article that uses the data from a particular corpus 
must cite a reference from the contributor of that corpus. The exact reference is 
given in the CHILDES manual (MacWhinney, 199 l b). In addition, researchers should 
cite the 1991 version of the manual, since this allows us to track references in the 
literature. 
All of the CHILDES materials can be obtained without charge by anonymous FTP 
to childes.psy.cmu.edu in Pittsburgh and atila-ftp.uia.ac.be in Antwerp. Our address 
on the World Wide Web is http://childes.psy.cmu.edu. For users without access to the 
Internet, as well as for those who want a convenient way of storing the database, we 
have published (MacWhinney, 1994a) a CD-ROM that can be read by Macintosh, 
UNIX, and MS-DOS machines that have a CD-ROM reader. The disk contains the 
database, the programs, and the CHILDES/BIB system. One directory contains the 
materials in Macintosh format and the other contains the materials in UNIX/DOS 
format. The CD-ROM, the printed manual, and the research guide are available at 
nominal cost through Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 
44-4. CHAT 
All of the files in the database use a standard transcription format called CHAT. This 
system is designed to accommodate a large variety of levels of analysis, while still 
permitting a bare-bones form of transcription for those research projects in which 
additional levels of detail are not needed. Here is a brief example of segment of a 
transcript from a Broca's aphasic transcribed in CHAT. The file begins with these 10 
lines of identifying material, or "headers." 
@Begin

@ Situation: 
Given/New task 
After the headers, the actual transcript begins. This is a picture description task 
and each picture is identified with an @g marker to facilitate later retrieval. In the 
first three @g segments, the patient is describing a set of three pictures used in Bates, 
Hamby, and Zurif (1983) and MacWhinney and Bates (1978). In this first set, various 
animals are all eating bananas. In its "raw" form, what the patient said was simply, 
"rabbits, squirrel, monkeys." Here is how this is transcribed: 

608 
Brian MacWhinney 
@g: 
3c = bunny is eating banana 
*PAT: 
rabbits [*]. 
%mor: 
DETI0 NIrabbit-*PL 
%err: 
rabbits = rabbit $SUB 
@g: 
3b = squirrel eating banana 
*PAT: 
squirrel. 
%mor: 
DETI0 NIsquirrel 
@g: 
3a = monkey eating banana 
*PAT: 
monkeys [*]. 
%mor: 
DETI0 Nlmonkey-*PL. 
%err: 
monkeys = monkey $SUB 
Here, the *PAT line conveys the simple shape of the patients description of the 
three pictures--"rabbits, squirrel, monkeys." We can notice several things about this 
transcription. First, the err or "error" lines code the fact that plurals are used for two 
of the pictures when, in fact, only a single animal appears in each. The locus of these 
errors is marked in the main line or *PAT line with the symbol [*]. The %mor line 
is designed to indicate the morphological shape of the words on the main line. This 
line is used to study the use of different parts of speech and syntactic constructions. 
In this example, the %mor also provides a backup to the %err line, since both lines 
code for errors of omission and commission. The %mor line is intended to have a 
one-to-one correspondence with the main line, but when an item is marked as missing 
on the %mor line, it does not need to be present on the main line. For example, the 
code "DETI0" indicates that the determiner is missing on the main line. The code 
"Nlmonkey-*PL" indicates that the patient used the noun monkey in the plural, but 
that the use of the plural was an error in this case. The advantage of the elaborate 
coding on the %mor line is that it provides a more systematic structure for search 
programs that tabulate missing items by part of speech. 
Let us look at one more segment from the same patient in the same study. Here 
the picture involves the dative verb give. It is "raw" form, what the patient said was 
simply, "boy, girl, school, rat, boy no girl, girl truck girl." Here is how this is tran- 
scribed: 
@g: 
8a = lady giving present to girl 
*PAT: 
boy [*] [//] girl # school [*]. 
%mor: 
DETI0 Nlgirl Nl*xxx. 
%err: 
boy = girl $SUB ;school = [?] $SUB 
@g: 
8c = lady giving mouse to girl 
*PAT: 
rat. 
%mor: 
DETI0 Nlrat 
@g: 
8b = lady giving truck to girl 
*PAT: 
<boy [*] no>[//] girl [/] girl truck # girl +... 
%mor: 
DETI0 NIgirl Nltruck Nigirl. 
%err: 
boy = girl $SUB 
In this example, we see several additional features. In description for picture 8a, 
the self-correction or retracing of boy by girl is marked by [//]. The repetition of the 
word girl is marked by [/]. Pauses are marked by # and the trailing off of the last 
sentence for picture 8b is marked by +... In the description for picture 8c, there is 

44

no %err line, since the characterization of the mouse 
as a rat is not judged to be so 
far off the mark as to constitute an error. 
These two examples illustrate only a few of the many symbols and conventions 
available in the CHAT system. The system provides many options, but the transcriber 
only needs to select out those options that are relevant to the particular case. The 
simpler the transcription, the better, as long as it still captures the important aspects 
of the aphasic production. 
The examples we have looked at illustrate some of the basic principles of the CHAT 
transcription system. Three of the most fundamental aspects of the system are the 
following: 
1. Each utterance is transcribed as a separate entry. Even in cases when a speaker 
continues for several utterances, each new utterance must begin a new entry. 
2. Coding information is separated out from the basic transcription and placed 
on separate "dependent tiers" below the main line. The CHILDES manual 
presents coding systems for phonology, speech acts, speech errors, 
morphology, and syntax. The user can create additional coding systems to 
serve special needs. 
3. On the main line, transcription is designed to enter a set of standard language 
word forms that correspond as directly as possible to the forms produced by 
the learner. Of course, learner forms differ from the standard language in 
many ways and there are a variety of techniques in the CHAT system for 
notating these divergences, while still maintaining the listing of word forms to 
facilitate computer retrieval. 
For full examples of the coding system and its many options, the reader should 
consult the CHILDES manual. 
44-5. CLAN 
The main emphasis of new developments in the CHILDES system has been on the 
writing of new computer programs. Currently, there are two major components of the 
CHILDES programs. The first is the set of programs for searching and string com- 
parison called CLAN (Child Language Analysis). The second is a set of facilities built 
up around an editor called CED (CHILDES Editor). 
The CLAN programs have been designed to support four basic types of linguistic 
analysis (Crystal, 1982; Crystal, Fletcher, & Garman, 1989): lexical analysis, mor- 
phosyntactic analysis, discourse analysis, and phonological analysis. In addition, there 
are programs for file display, automation of coding, measure computation, and addi- 
tional utilities. Table 2 lists the full set of programs by type. 
44-5.1. Lexical Analyses 
The programs for lexical analysis like FREQ and KWAL focus on ways of searching 
for particular strings. The strings to be located can be entered in a command line, one

at a time, or put together in a master file. The strings can contain wild cards and 
words can be combined using Boolean operators such as and, not, and or. Together, 
these various capabilities give the user virtually complete control over the nature of 
the patterns to be located, the files to be searched, and the way in which the results 
of the search should be combined into files or even reduced into data for statistical 
analysis. Scores of studies have appeared in the published literature using these tech- 
niques to track the development of lexical fields, such as morality, kinship, gender 
terminology, mental states, causative verbs, and modal auxiliaries. It is also possible 
to track the use of words of a given length or a given lexical frequency. FREQ outputs 
a complete frequency analysis for a single file or for groups of files. Here is an 
example of a FREQ frequency count for a single small file with only the Mother's 
utterances being analyzed.

Each of these programs has many options that can allow the user to vary the 
shape of the input, the shape of the output, and the type of analysis that is being 
conducted. 
44-5.2. Morphosyntactic Analyses 
Many of the most important questions in child language require the detailed study of 
specific morphosyntactic features and constructions. Typically, this type of analysis 
can be supported by the coding of a complete %mor line in accord with the guidelines 
specified in Chapter 14 of the CHILDES Manual. Once a complete %mor tier is 
available, a vast range of morphological and syntactic analyses becomes possible. 
However, hand-coding of a %mor tier for the entire CHILDES database would require 
perhaps 20 years of work and would be extremely error-prone and noncorrectable. If 
the standards for morphological coding changed in the middle of this project, the 
coders would have to start over again from the beginning. It would be difficult to 
imagine a more tedious and frustrating taskmthe hand-coder's equivalent of Sisyphus 
and his stone. 
To address this problem, we have built an automatic coding program for CHAT 
files, called MOR. Although the system is designed to be transportable to all lan- 
guages, it is currently only fully elaborated for English, Japanese, Dutch, and German. 
The language-independent part of MOR is the core processing engine. All of the 
language-specific aspects of the systems are built into files that can be modified by 
the user. In the remarks that follow, we will first focus on ways in which a user can 
apply the system for English. The MOR program takes a CHAT main line and au- 
tomatically inserts a %mor line together with the appropriate morphological codes for 
each word on the main line. Although you can run MOR on any CLAN file, in order 
to get a well-formed %mor line, you often need to engage in significant extra work. 
In particular, users of MOR will often need to spend a great deal of time engaging in 
the processes of lexicon building and ambiguity resolution. To facilitate lexicon build- 
ing, there are several options in MOR to check for unrecognized lexemes and to add 

44 
Computational Transcript Analysis 
613 
new items. To facilitate ambiguity resolution, we have integrated a system for sense 
selection into the CED editor. 
Construction of a full %mor line using MOR also makes possible several additional 
forms of analysis. One is the automatic running of the DSS program, which computes 
the Developmental Sentence Score profile of Lee (1974). Parallel systems of analysis 
will eventually be developed for systems such as IPSYN (Scarborough, 1990) or 
LARSP (Crystal et al., 1989). The %mor line can also be used as the basis for CLAN 
programs such as COOCCUR, which examines local syntactic structures, and CHIP; 
which examines recasts, imitations, and structural reductions. 
Because of the importance of agrammatism in the study of aphasia, it would seem 
that the MOR program would be of particular interest to aphasiologists. However, the 
presence of large numbers of lexical, phonological, and syntactic errors in aphasic 
speech makes automatic application of the MOR program more difficult. Despite these 
difficulties, this is an area of great potential interest for work on language disorders. 
44-5.3. Discourse and Narrative 
The most important CLAN tool for discourse analysis is the system for data coding 
inside the CED editor. CED provides the user with not only a complete text editor, 
but also a systematic way of entering user-determined codes into dependent tiers in 
CHAT files. In the coding mode, CED allows the user to establish a predetermined 
set of codes and then to march through the file line by line making simple keystroke 
movements that enter the correct codes for each utterance selected. 
Once a file has been fully coded in CED, a variety of additional analyses become 
possible. The standard search tools of FREQ, KWAL, and COMBO can be used to 
trace frequencies of particular codes. However, it is also possible to use the CHAINS, 
DIST, and KEYMAP programs to track sequences of particular codes. For example, 
KEYMAP will create a contingency table for all the types of codes that follow some 
specified code or group of codes. It can be used, for example, to trace the extent to 
which a mother's question is followed by an answer from the child, as opposed to 
some irrelevant utterance or no response at all. DIST lists the average distances be- 
tween words or codes. CHAINS looks at sequences of codes across utterances. Typ- 
ically, the chains being tracked are between and within speaker sequences of speech 
acts, reference types, or topics. The output is a table that maps, for example, chains 
in which there is no shift of topic and places where the topic shifts. Wolf, Moreton, 
and Camp (1994) apply CHAINS to transcripts that have been coded for discourse 
units. Yet another perspective on the shape of the discourse can be computed by using 
the MLT program that computes the mean length of the turn for each speaker. 
44-5.4. Phonological Analyses 
Currently, phonological analysis is a bit of a stepchild in CLAN, but we have plans 
to correct this situation. These plans involve two types of developments. One is 
the amplification of standard programs for inventory analysis, phonological process 

614 
Brian MacWhinney 
analysis, model-and-replica analysis, and other standard frameworks for phonological 
investigation. Currently, the two programs adapted to phonological analysis are 
PHONFREQ, which computes the frequencies of various segments, separating out 
consonants and vowels by their various syllable positions, and MODREE which 
matches %pho tier symbols with the corresponding main line text. For more precise 
control of MODREE it is possible to create a separate %mad line in which each 
segment on the %pho corresponds to exactly one segment on the %mad line. 
The second set of plans for improving our ability to do phonological analysis 
focuses on the use of digitized sound within the CED editor. On the Macintosh, the 
CED editor allows the transcriber direct access to digitized audio records that have 
been stored using an application such as Sound Edit 16. We hope to implement a 
similar utility for the Windows platform. Using this system, which we call "sonic 
CHAT," one can simply double-click on an utterance and it will play back in full 
CD-quality audio. Moreover, the exact beginning and end points of the utterance are 
coded in milliseconds and the PAUSE program can use these data to compute total 
speaker time, time in pausing between utterances, and overlap duration time. A sample

is given in Figure 1. In this file, the numbers on the %snd tier refer to absolute time 
in milliseconds from the beginning to the end of a particular utterance. 
The basic CLAN programs like FREQ and KWAL are extremely easy to use and 
understand. They work on a simple MS-DOS type command line and one can often 
get the basic answers to important research questions without an understanding of any 
of the more arcane uses of some of the less common CLAN programs. In addition, 
users can rely on a well-tested manual that is now in its second edition; and there are 
additional support resources available over the Internet. 
44-6. CONCLUSION 
Earlier we looked at four periods in the growth of observational studies of language 
development. We are now entering the fifth period of methodological development. 
Our plans for the future development of the CHILDES system are based on the view 
of the fifth stage of observational research as being the period of electronic connec- 
tivity and exploratory reality. Our first priority for this period is to make full use of 
the facilities of the World Wide Web (WWW) to provide multimedia access to the 
database, the bibliographic system, and the manual. Using currently available tools 
such as Netscape, Macintosh AV facilities, and HTML formatting programs, it is now 
possible for a user to use a sequence of mouse clicks to open up pages of the 
CHILDES manual, search for particular files in particular corpora, open up those files, 
and hear the sounds in each. It is even possible to have pictures of the children and 
parents accessible over the net. 
Equally important is the growth of connectivity between programs on a single 
computer. An example of the type of development we are currently supporting is the 
linkage of the CED editor to high-level speech analysis tools such as Signalyze on 
the Macintosh or WAVES on UNIX. We also plan to have access to a reference 
database of IPA sounds, as well as audio examples of specific uses of CHAT symbols 
and codes. 
44-6.1. The Glossome 
The emergent connectivity of the Internet has opened up an exciting prospect that few 
researchers have yet considered. This is the potential for the establishment of a Glos- 
some Database. Much like the Human Genome Database, the Glossome Database 
would be supported by data entry over the Internet. The creation of a set of standards 
for data transcription and transmission will allow us to store and access a wide variety 
of data from a wide variety of normal and disordered populations. 
In order to make successful use of these new opportunities, we will need to develop 
a higher level of consciousness in both the adult aphasia research community and the 
child language disorders research community. In each of these areas, the strong com- 
mitment to patients' rights must be protected and encouraged. However, researchers 
often cite patients' rights as a motivation for not sharing their data with the broader 

616 
Brian MacWhinney 
research community. This interpretation of personal rights does damage to the progress 
of the very field that is dedicated to improving the condition of the aphasic patient. 
The only way to counter these protectionist sentiments is for major figures in the field 
to lead by contributing new data to the database and by encouraging younger re- 
searchers to follow their lead. 
Currently, we have had much more success in convincing students of child lan- 
guage disorders than students of adult aphasia to enter their data into CHILDES. Given 
the fairly advanced state of methodology in the CHILDES system and the small 
amount of aphasic data currently in CHAT format, it may now make more sense to 
focus our efforts on collecting new sets of well-transcribed data that are accompanied 
with full digitized audio records that could be accessed directly over the Internet. 
Ideally, we would like to see a large body of consistently transcribed data for com- 
parable tasks, which could provide us with a consistent basis for comparison. Although 
the transcription standards and analytic programs are already in place, there must be 
a period of further dialogue regarding elicitation tasks and related issues. We would 
like to work together with workers in the field of adult aphasia to build a solid 
empirical database for studies of disordered language production in both adults and 
children.

Assessment and rehabilitation tools play an important part in clinical neurolinguistics and 
in neurolinguistic research. Whereas information on nonelectronic tools and material is 
readily available, it is still laborious to obtain information on what is available in electronic 
form. The information listed in this chapter was obtained by placing a "want ad" in 
major Internet discussion lists, by performing Internet, database, and library catalog 
searches on the subject, by contacting publishers and authors, and last but not least by 
word-of-mouth 
information from researchers in the field. Despite our efforts, we re- 
ceived very little feedback concerning software aimed at non-English or non-German- 
speaking target groups. Consequently, our search may not have reached all publishers 
and authors, and available sources may have been overlooked. In order to improve this 
listing in the next edition of the Handbook, we would like to encourage readers to send 
us any information that seems suitable for inclusion in the next edition. In this context, 
we would like to point out that no evaluation of the content of the cited material has been 
made. Hence, neither the editors nor the publisher can endorse specific programs. Fur- 
thermore, most software was furnished us on a demo disk; thus we cannot attest to the 
functionality of the complete program. 
The chapter is divided into two main sections. The first will refer the reader to addresses or 
references for further information such as software providers, software listings, and useful soft- 
ware addresses on the Internet. The second will list individual programs, that is, the name of

The Naming Test 
Assessment tool for naming ability. On-line help is provided by cues in hierarchical fashion 
(associated sound stimulus, semantic cues, phonemic cues, and multiple choice). 
Williams Picture Vocabulary Test (WPVT) 
Assessment tool for vocabulary. A word is presented in natural, digitized speech along with 
four color photographs. The subject is requested to indicate the word. Norms are currently 
collected for the test and users are invited to participate in the study. 
The Category Test 
A test for the assessment of cognitive styles and neuropsychological syndromes. Stimulus 
sets must be organized according to rules invented by and consistently used by the person. 
Auditory Perception 
Tool to examine auditory neglect and cerebral dominance for auditory information. The 
program allows the user to perform the standard audiological neglect studies, test auditory 
acuity for amplitude and pitch using pure tones, perform dichotic listening studies with pure 
tones and speech, and examine auditory agnosia using environmental sounds. Users may 
also enter their own auditory stimuli using an inexpensive sound digitizer. 
Rhythm Perception 
Tool to create a series of randomly generated musical rhythm patterns and present them over 
headphones. The pattern lengths and presentation order are set by the user. The program 
presents the target pattern and then requests the subject to identify the target when presented 
with one distractor pattern of the same length and sound pitch. Although the program will cre- 
ate pattern sets, the user has complete editing control and may alter any set or create new sets 
by typing in rhythm patterns, or even melodies, using conventional musical notation. 
Similar Sounds 
Program for the assessment of auditory agnosia. The program presents common environ- 
mental sounds and requests the subject to identify and name them. The program includes a 
section that requires the subject to name similar, popular musical tunes.

9 Lexical Access Model (Gary Dell & Dan Foygel) 
The program instantiates the model of normal and disordered lexical access developed by 
Dell, Schwartz, Martin, Saffran, and Gagnon. The model specifics the probabilities of correct 
responses, semantic errors, formal errors, neologisms, mixed semantic/formal errors, and un- 
related word errors as a function of model parameters in a picture-naming task. For example, 
if a patient's naming errors are categorized in a particular way, the program will find the 
best-fitting parameters for that patient, according to the authors' theory. 
The authors are planning to make the program available on the WWW. For further infor-

9 Lingraphica System (languages: English and Spanish) (Tolfa Corporation) 
Lingraphica is a portable visual-language prosthesis used as a therapy tool for recovering 
and chronic aphasic patients. It is based on the Visual Communication (VIC) approach reported 
on in 1976 by Howard Gardner and his VA-based group in Boston and later adapted and 
extended by researchers at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center using microcomputers, the so- 
called C-VIC (Computerized visual communication) system. Everyday items and activities are 
displayed as picture images that can, upon "touch," be enlarged, animated, spoken, or displayed 
in written form. Images can be copied to a storyboard to create complete expression. The 
therapist can select from a large amount of activities. The system is self-documenting and 
patient reports are automatically compiled. The system can be used in a clinical setting or at 
the patient's residence. 
Hardware: Lingraphica is regulated by the FDA as a medical device and the portable unit 
is dispensed by physician prescription only.

TheDiaS, TUS, PhonX (language: German) (Clinical Neuropsychology Research Group, 
City Hospital Bogenhausen, Munich, Germany, in cooperation with the Institute for Com- 
munication Engineering, Federal Armed Forces University, Munich, Germany). 
TheDiaS (Therapy and Diagnostics of Speech) has been developed for therapy and diagnosis 
of central speech disorders. Individual components of speaking can be objectively differ- 
entiated and evaluated. Specially designed training procedures have been developed to im- 
prove the impaired speech-motor components. 
PhonX (Phonetic eXperimentation) (J. Teiwes & W. Ziegler) provides an experimental tool- 
box to investigate the different processes hypothesized to be relevant in current models of 
production and comprehension of spoken language. The "Listening" component contains 
tools for devising perceptual experiments in the acoustic domain. The "Speaking" compo- 
nent enables users to design repetition, reading, and naming tasks. PhonX can be used for 
experimental purposes as well as in standard clinical examinations of aphasia, apraxia of 
speech, dysarthria, or dementia. 
The TUS (Testing Unit for Speech Disorders) (T. Ahrndt & W. Ziegler) is a tool to evaluate 
central speech impairments and to train patients with speech disorders. Speech can be re- 
corded and replayed with a focus on standard clinical applications such as intelligibility 
testing, auditory rating scales of dysarthria, and syllable repetition tasks. 
The patients' responses are saved in a database, which allows further statistical processing 
and graphical output. 
Hardware requirements: IBM-compatible PC 486/66, PC card with digital signal processor, 
AD/DA converting unit, minimum of 4 RAM, 500 MB HD. PhonX and TheDiaS run under

The objective of this chapter is to provide reference material for those new to 
the field of neurolinguistics. We list journals that regularly publish articles on 
neurolinguistic issues and books that are directly or indirectly related to neuro- 
linguistics. Due to the large amount of material published and space constraints, 
the list is not exhaustive. For similar reasons, no evaluations of the quality of the 
contents is given. In keeping with our policy of providing a "state-of-the-art" 
handbook, we have restricted ourselves to listing books that were first published 
since 1990. This does not mean, however, that "older" books are of no relevance. 
On the contrary, there certainly are contributions prior to this date that are 
important and will continue to influence current thinking in the field. Here we 
trust the reader's own initiative to locate these books. Finally, we have included 
sourcebooks that either are directly related to neurolinguistics or, in a somewhat 
broader perspective, point the reader to other areas of interest that have an 
impact on neurolinguistics. 
The listing is based on searches in databases such as PsycLit, Psyndex, Social Sciences 
Citation Index SSCI, Medline, Science Citation Index, and Psychlnfo. University cat- 
alogs and publishers' catalogs were also consulted. 
Despite our efforts to provide an up-to-date listing, references may have slipped 
by and new material may have been in press at the time this listing was compiled. 
We thus encourage the reader to provide us with information on such material, which 
will be included in a revised version of the Handbook of Neurolinguistics.

ception and their implications not only for speech perception and production but also for related 
areas such as the production and perception of sign language, perception in nonhuman animals, 
lipreading, language acquisition, sentence processing, reading, and learning to read.

The Internet is a decentralized network that connects networks of computers. In the last 
few years, information that can be obtained from the Internet has grown tremendously 
and new information is added continuously. Because of the rapid changes and growth of 
the Internet, it is impossible to give a comprehensive, up-to-date account of all the current 
resources that are helpful for the reader interested in neurolinguistics and related fields. 
The main purpose of this section is to provide a variety of information sources that can 
be used as a basis for continued browsing. Sites directly and indirectly relevant and related 
to neurolinguistics (such as linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, neurology, and so forth) 
will be cited. In this context, a word of caution is necessary: addresses which exist today 
on the Net may have disappeared by tomorrow. Still, we hope that the listing will help 
the "wired" reader to move around in neurolinguistic and related cyberspace in an effi- 
cient and time-saving way. 
Although it is beyond the scope of this section to introduce the reader to all the possibilities 
for navigating the Internet, a brief explanation as to how the listed addresses (so-called 
URLsmUniform Resource Locators) were obtained may help the novice to the Internet to update 
information himself or herself. 
In order to gather and access information on the Net, a service called the Global Network 
Navigator organizes information through its World Wide Web (WWW) by weaving a weblike 
route among individual information entities. For example, if you do a search using the word

neurolinguistics, a list of words and phrases will appear on the screen, some of which are 
highlighted, such as institutes and directories. If you click on the word institutes, a list of 
neurolinguistic institutes appears on the screen; these again are highlighted and thus can be 
selected (by clicking on the word or phrase) to obtain further information on a particular 
institute. To access the Global Network Navigator, Internet access providers offer "web brows- 
ers" such as Netscape Navigator or MS Explorer. 1 Each Web destination has its own home 
address, a "home page." To travel to this home page, you need an address called URL (Uniform 
Resource Locator). On some servers, the URL is case-sensitive, that is, you need to use the 
exact spelling. If you do not know the URL, you can use a search engine, which will search 
for the address and connect you to the home page. The following are some common search 
engines and their URLs: 
alta vista 
http://www.altavista.com/ 
yahoo! 
http://www.yahoo.com/ 
lycos 
http://www.lycos.com/ 
webcrawler 
http://wc3.webcrawler.com/ 
All Internet addresses listed in this chapter were found by using such a search engine. Once 
you have typed in the item you want to do a search on, the search engine browses the Web 
and an index of search-related items appears on the screen, which can then be used again as 
links to information related to that particular item. The information we provide in the listing 
is mostly restricted to first- and second-level links as space does not permit a listing of all 
follow-up links. Once the reader has accessed the address, however, s/he can easily follow up 
on links of her or his own interest. 
Throughout the listing, the following notation conventions will be observed: The name of 
the major site is given first (denoted by a 9 and underlined). This is followed by its URL. 2 If 
the home page of the site provides further links that we find helpful, we have listed those links, 
or a selection thereof. An --> will denote that the item following the arrow is a selectable link. 
Links are separated from each other by [. Deeper-level links will be cited using ~. Items that 
appear in square brackets [ 
] usually show menu items displayed by the Web site. These items 
can be selected just like link items. 
The chapter is organized into four main sections: (1) Libraries and Bookstores, (2) Publishers 
and Journals, (3) Newsgroups and Mailing Lists, and (4) Other useful URLs.

lIn order to use Netscape or MS Explorer you will need access to a server via SLIP or PPP. If your site does 
not support SLIP or PPP, there are nevertheless alternatives to browse the Web and you should inquire at your 
computer department. On most UNIX servers a program called "lynx" can be used. At the UNIX prompt, type 
in the word lynx follwed by the enter/return key. If you know the URL, type in lynx URL. For example: lynx 
http://www.excite.com will call the search engine "Excite," which you can use to browse the WEB in lynx. Another 
possibility is to obtain "Slipknot," a shareware program that does not need SLIP or PPP and can be used very 
similarly to Netscape or MS Explorer. Slipknot can be obtained at hnp://plaza.interport.et/slipknot/whatsnew.html 
2Note that the sometimes complex addresses can be saved as a bookmark and thus only need to be clicked 
on for retrieval.

47-3. NEWSGROUPS AND MAILING LISTS 
47-3.1. USENET and Newsgroups 
This is a collection of thousands of electronic bulletin boards with topics you can and cannot 
imagine. These bulletin boards are also known as newsgroups and the discussions range from 
bizarre encounters to serious academic exchanges. You can just browse these newsgroups, or 
actively participate in any discussion. Internet service providers offer a "newsreader" and tell 
you how to use it. If you are using a UNIX system on which PPP or SLIP is not available, 
usually the command rn or nn at the command prompt will give you access to the news- 
groups from which you can choose those you want to read. Because of the large number of 
newsgroups, we will refrain from citing any here but refer the reader to the newsread 
browsers. 
47-3.2. Mailing Lists~LISTSERV 
Unlike newsgroups, which are electronic bulletin boards everybody can just look at and post 
messages on, mailing lists require that you subscribe to them via a list server in order to get 
information or participate in a discussion; and some are organized by a moderator.

47-3.2.1. 
What Is a Listserv? 
A listserv is a program that maintains one or more mailing lists (i.e., a list server). A listserv 
automatically distributes an E-mail message from one member of a list to all other members 
on that list. Listservs maintain thousands of lists in the form of digests, electronic journals, 
discussion groups, and the like. When you subscribe to a list, your name and E-mail address 
are automatically added to the list. From that time on, you will receive all mail (postings) sent 
to the list by its members. You may follow the discussions or join in on them. If you need 
help on the specific server, you can send an E-mail message to the listserv address. In the text 
body, type only the word HELP and you will receive an E-mail message that lists commands 
of and useful information about the specific server.
