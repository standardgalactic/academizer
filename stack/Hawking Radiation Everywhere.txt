Hawking radiation isn't just for black holes, study shows
In 1974, Hawking showed that black holes aren't stable, but emit radiation and decay. Nearly 50 years later, it isn't just for black holes.
black hole emission radiation
For the real black holes that exist or get created in our Universe, we can observe the radiation emitted by their surrounding matter, and the gravitational waves produced by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The electromagnetic radiation that we see solely originates from outside the event horizon itself; the Hawking radiation that black holes are predicted to emit is thus far unobservable in practice.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
In 1974, Stephen Hawking published a landmark paper showing that black holes aren't stable entities in spacetime, but slowly and gradually decay through the emission of radiation. The quantum process that powers this Hawking radiation arises based on the difference in the quantum vacuum near and far from the black hole's event horizon. For the first time, a new study suggests that this Hawking radiation doesn't depend on the event horizon at all, and should be present for all masses within spacetime, with astounding implications for physics.

The "Starts With a Bang" article published on June 1, 2023, discusses a recent study which has shown that Hawking radiation, previously thought to be exclusively associated with black holes, may actually be ubiquitous across all masses in spacetime. Stephen Hawking, in 1974, theorized that black holes are not permanent structures but gradually decay over time due to the emission of Hawking radiation. This radiation originates from the quantum vacuum differentials near and far from a black hole's event horizon. However, this new study contends that Hawking radiation does not depend on the event horizon, suggesting that it could be present for all masses in spacetime. If confirmed, these findings could have significant implications for our understanding of physics.

One of the most remarkable achievements in theoretical physics came in 1974, when Stephen Hawking demonstrated that black holes are not static, stable entities within spacetime, but rather must emit radiation and eventually decay. This radiation, known forever after as Hawking radiation, arises due to the combination of the facts that:

quantum fields permeate all of space,
including inside and outside a black hole's event horizon,
that these fields are not static but exhibit quantum fluctuations,
and that those fields behave differently in regions where the curvature of spacetime is different.

When Hawking first put these facts together, his calculation showed that black holes can't be stable with a constant mass, but will instead emit an omnidirectional amount of extremely low-temperature blackbody radiation. This radiation propagates away from the event horizon, and since real radiation carries energy, the only place where that energy can be taken from is from the mass of the black hole itself: via the classic equation E = mc², where the mass lost by the black hole has to balance the energy of the emitted radiation.

But in a delightful new paper, physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke have challenged the idea that an event horizon is necessary for this radiation. According to their new approach, this radiation arises solely because of the differences in the quantum vacuum of space dependent on its curvature, and therefore Hawking radiation should be emitted by all masses in the Universe, even those without event horizons. It's a remarkable idea and one that's been brewing for a long time. Let's unpack why.

qcd particle antiparticle visualization
A visualization of QCD illustrates how particle-antiparticle pairs pop out of the quantum vacuum for very small amounts of time as a consequence of Heisenberg uncertainty. The quantum vacuum is interesting because it demands that empty space itself isn't so empty, but is filled with all the particles, antiparticles, and fields in various states that are demanded by the quantum field theory that describes our Universe. The particle-antiparticle pairs illustrated here, however, are only a calculational tool; they are not to be confused with real particles.

There's a very common misconception about how Hawking radiation works, put forth by none other than Hawking himself in his celebrated popular book, A Brief History of Time. The way Hawking told us to envision it:

the Universe is filled with particle-antiparticle pairs popping in-and-out of existence,
even in empty space, as a consequence of quantum field theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
that in uncurved space, these pairs always find one another and re-annihilate after a very small time interval,
but if an event horizon is present, one member of the pair can "fall in" while the other "escapes,"
leading to a situation where real particles (or antiparticles) are emitted with positive mass/energy from just outside the horizon itself,
whereas the paired member that falls into the event horizon must have "negative energy" that subtracts from the black hole's total mass.
It's a convenient picture, to be sure, but it's a picture that even Hawking himself knew must be false. Despite the fact that, in his 1974 paper, he wrote:

"It should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission and area decrease are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally,"

He does, in fact, take it literally in his 1988 book that brought this idea to the general public.

Hawking radiation incorrect
In Hawking's most famous book, A Brief History of Time, he makes the analogy that space is filled with particle-antiparticle pairs and that one member can escape (carrying positive energy) while the other falls in (with negative energy), leading to black hole decay. This flawed analogy continues to confuse generations of physicists and laypersons alike.

The reason you cannot take this picture literally is because the particle-antiparticle pairs that pop in-and-out of existence are not actual, real particles; they are what physicists call virtual particles: a calculational tool that we use that represents fluctuations in the underlying fields, but that are not "real" in the sense that we cannot interact with or measure them directly in any way.

If you did take this picture literally, you'd erroneously think that this Hawking radiation is composed of a mixture of particles and antiparticles; it is not. Instead, it's just composed of extremely low-energy photons in a blackbody spectrum, as even the lightest set of massive particles known, the neutrinos and antineutrinos, are far too heavy for even a single one to be produced by the real black holes in our Universe.

Instead, the actual explanation — although there are many legitimate ways to approach calculating the effect (including ways that do involve these virtual particle-antiparticle pairs) — is that it is the difference in the quantum vacuum (i.e., the fundamental properties of quantum fields in empty space) between regions of space with different amounts of spatial curvature that leads to the production of this thermal, blackbody radiation that we call Hawking radiation.

black hole decay
The most common, and incorrect, explanation for how Hawking radiation arises is an analogy with particle-antiparticle pairs. If one member with negative energy falls into the black hole's event horizon, while the other member with positive energy escapes, the black hole loses mass and outgoing radiation departs the black hole. This explanation has misinformed generations of physicists and came from Hawking himself. One of the errors inherent to this explanation is the notion that all of the Hawking radiation arises from the event horizon itself: it does not.

There are a few interesting points that arise, that have been known for many decades, as a consequence of the ways Hawking radiation actually works.

Interesting point #1: The Hawking radiation itself cannot all originate from the event horizon of the black hole itself.


One of the fun things you can calculate, at any moment in time, is the density of the Hawking radiation that arises all throughout space. You can calculate the energy density as a function of distance from the black hole, and you can compare that to a calculation for what the expected energy density would be if the radiation all originated at the event horizon itself and then propagated outward in space.

Remarkably, those two calculations do not match up at all; in fact, most of the Hawking radiation that arises around the event horizon of the black hole originates within about 10-20 Schwarzschild radii (the radius from the singularity to the event horizon) of the event horizon, rather than at the event horizon itself. In fact, there are non-zero amounts of radiation that are emitted throughout all of space, even far away from the event horizon itself. The horizon itself may play a role that's important in the generation of Hawking radiation, just as Unruh radiation ought to be generated owing to the presence of a cosmic horizon in our own Universe, but you cannot generate all of your Hawking radiation at the event horizon of a black hole and get predictions that are consistent with our theoretical calculations.

still flawed Hawking radiation diagram
It must be noted that it isn't particles or antiparticles that are produced when black holes undergo Hawking radiation, but rather photons. One can calculate this using the tools of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs in curved space in the presence of an event horizon, but those virtual pairs should not be construed as being real particles, nor should all of the radiation be construed as arising from just barely outside the event horizon.
Credit: E. Siegel
Interesting point #2: More radiation gets emitted from more severely curved regions of space, implying that lower-mass black holes emit more Hawking radiation and decay faster than higher-mass ones.

This is a point that puzzles most people the first time they hear about it: the more massive your black hole is, the less severely curved your space will be just outside the black hole's event horizon. Yes, the event horizon is always defined by that boundary where the escape velocity of a particle is either less than the speed of light (which is outside the event horizon) or greater than the speed of light (which defines inside the event horizon), and the size of this horizon is directly proportional to the black hole's mass.

But the curvature of space is much greater near the event horizon of a smaller, low-mass black hole than it is near the event horizon of a larger, greater-mass black hole. In fact, if we look at the properties of the emitted Hawking radiation for black holes of different (realistic) masses, we find:

The temperature of the radiation is inversely proportional to the mass: ten times the mass means one-tenth the temperature.
The luminosity, or radiated power, of a black hole, is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole's mass: ten times the mass means one-hundredth the luminosity.
And the evaporation time for a black hole, or how long it takes for a black hole to completely decay away into Hawking radiation, is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole cubed: a black hole that's ten times as massive as another will persist for one thousand times as long.
black hole
Although no light can escape from inside a black hole's event horizon, the curved space outside of it results in a difference between the vacuum state at different points near the event horizon, leading to the emission of radiation via quantum processes. This is where Hawking radiation comes from, and for the lowest-mass black holes ever discovered, Hawking radiation will lead to their complete decay in ~10^68 years. For even the largest mass black holes, survival beyond 10^103 years or so is impossible due to this exact process. The higher mass your black hole is, the weaker Hawking radiation is and the longer it will take to evaporate.

Interesting point #3: The amount by which spacetime is curved at a given distance from a mass is completely independent of how dense that mass is, or whether it has an event horizon at all.

Here's a fun question to consider. Imagine, if you will, that the Sun was magically, instantaneously replaced with an object that was the exact same mass as the Sun but whose physical size was either:

the size of the Sun itself (with a radius of about 700,000 km),
the size of a white dwarf (with a radius of about 7,000 km),
the size of a neutron star (with a radius of around 11 km),
or the size of a black hole (whose radius would be about 3 km).

Now, imagine you're assigned the following task: to describe what the curvature of space is, and how it's different, between these four separate examples.

The answer, quite remarkably, is that the only differences that arise are if you're at a location that's inside of the Sun itself. As long as you're more than 700,000 km away from a solar mass object, then it doesn't matter whether that object is a star, a white dwarf, a neutron star, a black hole, or any other object with or without an event horizon: its spacetime curvature and properties are the same.

curved spacetime black hole
Although the amount that spacetime is curved and distorted depends on how dense the object in question is when you're close to the object's edge, the size and volume that the object occupies is unimportant far away from the mass itself. For a black hole, neutron star, white dwarf, or a star like our Sun, the spatial curvature is identical at sufficiently large radii.

If you put these three points together, you might start wondering for yourself what many physicists have wondered for a very long time: does Hawking radiation only occur around black holes, or does it occur for all massive objects within spacetime?

Although the event horizon was a key feature in Hawking's original derivation of the radiation that now bears his name, there have been other derivations (sometimes in alternate numbers of dimensions) that have shown this radiation still exists in curved spacetime, irrespective of the presence or absence of such a horizon.

That's where the new paper that comes in is so interesting: the only role the event horizon plays is to serve as a boundary for where radiation can be "captured" from versus where it can "escape" from. The calculation is done in fully four-dimensional spacetime (with three space and one time dimension), and shares many important features with other approaches to calculating the presence and properties of Hawking radiation. The boundary for what gets captured versus what escapes would still exist for any other example of a mass we chose:

it would be the event horizon for a black hole,
the surface of a neutron star for a neutron star,
the outermost layer of a white dwarf for a white dwarf,
or the photosphere of a star for a star.
In all cases, there would still be an escape fraction that depended on the mass and radius of the object in question; there's nothing special about the presence or absence of an event horizon.

escape fraction relative to a black hole
The event horizon of a black hole has been considered an important factor in the generation of Hawking radiation around black holes in many previous studies, but a new one suggests that this radiation can still be generated outside of an event horizon even if the horizon itself does nothing more than forbid light from escaping from within it.

There's a very simple analogy to the approach that Wondrak, van Suijlekom, and Falcke take in their paper: to that of the Schwinger effect in electromagnetism. Way back in 1951, physicist Julian Schwinger — one of the co-discoverers of quantum electrodynamics — detailed how matter could be created from pure energy in the vacuum of space simply by creating a strong enough electric field. Whereas you can envision quantum field fluctuations however you like in the absence of an external field, applying a strong external field polarizes even the vacuum of space: separating positive from negative charges. If the field is strong enough, these virtual particles can become real, stealing energy from the underlying field to keep energy conserved.

Instead of an electric field, charged particles, and the Schwinger effect, the gravitational analogue is simply to use the background of curved spacetime for the electric field, to substitute an uncharged, massless scalar field for the charged particles: a simplistic analogue to stand-in for the photons that would be produced via Hawking radiation. Instead of the Schwinger effect, what they see is the production of new quanta in this curved spacetime, with a "production profile" that depends on the radius you are away from the event horizon. But note that there's nothing special about the horizon itself: production occurs at all distances sufficiently far from the object itself.

Ethan Siegel's article discusses a recent development in the theoretical understanding of Hawking radiation, the quantum process by which black holes are predicted to slowly lose energy and evaporate over time.
Hawking radiation is named after physicist Stephen Hawking, who, in 1974, proposed that black holes aren't just static entities in spacetime but should emit radiation due to quantum fluctuations in the fields permeating all of space, including inside and outside a black hole's event horizon.
The conventional explanation for Hawking radiation involves particle-antiparticle pairs popping in and out of existence due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. According to this explanation, one particle of the pair can fall into the black hole while the other escapes, leading to the black hole losing mass over time. However, this explanation is flawed as the particles involved in these quantum fluctuations are not real, observable particles but virtual ones. The actual particles that compose Hawking radiation are low-energy photons.
New research by physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke suggests that the generation of Hawking radiation doesn't require the presence of an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing can escape from a black hole. Instead, they propose that Hawking radiation arises from differences in the quantum vacuum of space dependent on its curvature. Therefore, according to their approach, Hawking radiation should be emitted by all masses in the Universe, not just those with event horizons. This idea has been brewing in the physics community for a while, and this paper provides a new perspective on it.
It should be noted that their approach is analogous to the Schwinger effect in electromagnetism, where a strong enough electric field in the vacuum of space can separate positive and negative charges, leading to the creation of real particles. In the gravitational analogue of this effect, the background of curved spacetime substitutes for the electric field, and an uncharged, massless scalar field is used instead of charged particles.
Overall, these findings challenge our understanding of black holes and the nature of Hawking radiation, suggesting that the latter may be a more universal phenomenon associated with the curvature of spacetime rather than being exclusive to black holes. However, these are theoretical findings, and more work is needed to test and verify these claims.

escaping radiation black hole
As calculated in the paper "Gravitational Pair Production and Black Hole Evaporation," there is no emitted radiation from inside a black hole's event horizon (less than "2" on the x-axis), but the radiation arises from an infinitely-extending region outside of the event horizon, peaking at 25% larger than the horizon itself but falling off slowly thereafter. The implication is that even massive objects without an event horizon, like stars, should emit some amount of Hawking radiation.
Credit: M.F. Wondrak et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. accepted, 2023
The key takeaway, assuming the paper's analysis is valid (which of course requires independent confirmation), is that there is no "special role" played by the event horizon as far as the production of radiation (or any other types of particles) goes. Quite generally, if you have

a quantum field theory,
with creation and annihilation operators,
with some sort of tidal, differential forces acting on the field fluctuations (or virtual particles and antiparticles, if you prefer),
that will create an additional separative effect over what you'd expect in a uniform background of empty space,
then you can conclude that a fraction of the particles that are produced will escape, in a radius-dependent fashion, irrespective of the presence or absence of an event horizon.

It's perhaps important to note that this new work does not reproduce all of the known features of Hawking radiation exactly; it is only a simplistic model that stands in for a realistic black hole. Nevertheless, many of the lessons gleaned from this study, as well as from the toy model motivating it, may prove to be incredibly important for understanding not only how Hawking radiation works, but under what circumstances and conditions it gets generated by. It also sets the stage, just as has been already accomplished for the Schwinger effect, for condensed matter analogue systems to be constructed, where this effect may actually be quantifiable and observable.

schwinger effect
In theory, the Schwinger effect states that in the presence of strong enough electric fields, (charged) particles and their antiparticle counterparts will be ripped from the quantum vacuum, empty space itself, to become real. Theorized by Julian Schwinger in 1951, the predictions were validated in a tabletop experiment, using a quantum analogue system, for the first time.

One of the things I greatly appreciate about this paper is that it corrects a big, widespread misconception: the idea that Hawking radiation is generated at the event horizon itself. Not only is this not true, but the horizon only serves as a "cutoff point" in the sense that no radiation generated inside of it can escape. Instead, there is a specific radial production profile for this radiation, where there's a peak amount of radiation that is generated and escapes at about 125% of the event horizon's radius, and then that radiation falls off and asymptotes to zero at greater radii, but there's always some non-zero amount of production that can be predicted.

An interesting thing to think about is that, for black holes, there is no external energy reservoir to "draw" this energy from, and hence the energy for this radiation must come from the massive object at the center, itself. For a black hole, that means it must decay, leading to its eventual evaporation.

hawking radiation black hole decay
The event horizon of a black hole is a spherical or spheroidal region from which nothing, not even light, can escape. But outside the event horizon, the black hole is predicted to emit radiation. Hawking's 1974 work was the first to demonstrate this, and it was arguably his greatest scientific achievement. A new study now suggests that Hawking radiation may even be emitted in the absence of black holes, with profound implications for all stars and stellar remnants in our Universe.

But for objects that aren't black holes, what is it, specifically, that will occur? Will this emitted radiation steal energy from the self-gravitational energy of an object like a star or stellar remnant, leading to gravitational contraction? Will it eventually lead to particle decays, or even some sort of phase transition within this object? Or does it imply something far more profound: such as once certain limits are reached and surpassed, that all matter will eventually collapse to a black hole and, via Hawking radiation, eventually decay?

At this point, these are just speculations, as they're questions that can only be answered by follow-up work. Nevertheless, this paper is a clever line of thought, and does something remarkable: it poses and analyzes a nearly 50-year-old problem in an entirely new way. Perhaps, if nature is kind, this will wind up bringing us closer to resolving some of the key, core issues at the very hearts of black holes. Although it's still just a suggestion, the implication is certainly worth considering: that all masses, not just black holes, may wind up emitting Hawking radiation.

It appears that you're referencing a recent paper discussing Hawking radiation and black holes, which postulates that the production of this radiation isn't limited to the event horizon of a black hole. Instead, the radiation originates from an infinitely extending region outside the event horizon. This could imply that other massive objects without event horizons, such as stars, may also emit some Hawking radiation.
This new understanding challenges a common misconception that Hawking radiation is produced at the event horizon itself. Rather, the horizon serves as a boundary where radiation generated inside of it can't escape. Outside this boundary, the radiation peaks at approximately 125% of the event horizon's radius and then gradually decreases, although there's always a non-zero amount of radiation produced.
As per this new research, the energy required for generating this radiation has to come from the central massive object. In the case of a black hole, this means it must decay, leading to its eventual evaporation.
The study also raises intriguing questions about the implications for objects that aren't black holes. For instance, could this emitted radiation draw energy from the self-gravitational energy of a star or stellar remnant, leading to its contraction? Might it eventually induce particle decays or phase transitions within these objects? Or could it even suggest that once certain thresholds are reached, all matter will eventually collapse to a black hole and decay through Hawking radiation? Further research is needed to answer these questions.
It's important to note that while this study offers a fresh perspective on a decades-old problem, its findings need to be independently verified. The exact nature of Hawking radiation and the conditions under which it is produced are still subjects of ongoing research. As always, scientific understanding evolves as new data and theoretical frameworks are explored.

Abstract

The dream of capturing the workings of the entire universe in a single equation or a simple set of equations is still pursued. A set of five new equivalent formulations of entropy based on the introduction of the mass of the information bit in Louis de Broglie's hidden thermodynamics and on the physicality of information, is proposed, within the framework of the emergent entangled informational universe model, which is based on the principle of strong emergence, the mass-energy-information equivalence principle and the Landauer's principle. This model can explain various process as informational quantum processes such energy, dark matter, dark energy, cosmological constant and vacuum energy. The dark energy is explained as a collective potential of all particles with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field, distinct from the usual fields of matter of quantum field theory, associated with dark matter as having a finite and quantifiable mass; while resolving the black hole information paradox by calculating the entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation, and shedding light on gravitational fine-grained entropy of black holes. This model explains the collapse of the wave function by the fact that a measure informs the measurer about the system to be measured and, this model is able to invalidate the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and the simulation hypothesis.

This paper titled "The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe" by Olivier Denis, appears to propose a new framework for understanding the universe. The author introduces a set of five new equivalent formulations of entropy based on Louis de Broglie's hidden thermodynamics and the concept of "informational mass."
The paper presents a model called the "Emergent Entangled Informational Universe" which is founded on the principles of strong emergence, the mass-energy-information equivalence, and Landauer's principle. Strong emergence is the idea that complex systems can have properties and behaviors not predictable by understanding the individual components of the system. Mass-energy-information equivalence is a concept that extends Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mc^2) to incorporate information as well. Landauer's principle connects information and thermodynamics, stating that any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the information processing apparatus or its environment.
In this framework, dark energy is suggested to be a collective potential of all particles with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field, distinct from the usual fields of quantum field theory. Dark matter is seen as having a finite and quantifiable mass in this model.
This model also takes on the challenge of resolving the black hole information paradox. It calculates the entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation, which may provide a novel approach to the problem. Moreover, it addresses the gravitational fine-grained entropy of black holes, offering potentially new insights into the nature of gravity around these extreme objects.
In terms of quantum mechanics, the model explains the collapse of the wave function as an information process. It posits that a measurement informs the observer about the system being measured, thereby causing the wave function to collapse. Interestingly, the model also appears to invalidate the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and the simulation hypothesis.
In conclusion, this paper proposes an intriguing model that tries to tie together many aspects of physics under a unified framework based on information theory. As with any scientific theory, its predictions and explanations need to be rigorously tested and evaluated by the wider scientific community. It would be fascinating to see how this model evolves and contributes to our understanding of the universe.

. INTRODUCTIONThe dream pursued by Albert Einstein and many physicists   who   still   pursued   the   dream   of capturing the workings of the entire universe in a single  equation  or  a  simple  set  of  equations is still   pursued.   A   set   of   five   new   equivalent formulation expressing the notion of entropy able to  reconcile  quantum  formalism  and  relativistic formalism   can   explain   various   processes   as informational  quantum  processes,  i.e.,  energy, black     holes,     dark     matter,     dark     energy, cosmological   constant   and   vacuum   energy. Those  equations  are  based  on  key  concepts such   as   Landauer's   principle   [1],   Louis   de Broglie's   hidden   thermodynamics   [2],   mass-energy-information    equivalence    principle    [3], principle testable by an experimental protocol as given  in  [4],  leading  to  the  fundamentality  ofquantum information considered as physical with a finite and quantifiable mass.In  the  first  part  of  this  work  entitled  "Structural basis",    some    theoretical    considerations    are examined   such   as   the   definition   of   quantum information,     quantum     entanglement, some considerations  on  quantum  non-locality  as  well as  the  notion  of  fundamentality  of  temperature and    information,    considered    as    the    two fundamental building blocks of the universe. This section   examines   in   detail   the   processes   of emergence that give birth to degrees of freedom from  which  emerge  the  temperature  and  the information,  both  giving  birth  to  the  notion  of energy according to Landauer's principle [1].Moreover,   this   section   offers   an   explicative informational process about the physical process of the collapse of the wave function based on the definition  of  the  quantum  measurement  where  a measure informs the measurer about the system to  be  measured,  the  measurer  shares  one  or more  degrees  of  freedom  (information)  with  the system   under   considerations,   and   both   are entangled  together  by  the  sharing  of  degrees  of freedom [5]. In  the  second  part  of  this  work,  concerning  the "Generalization"   of   the   approach   of   entropic information   theory,   the   mass   of   the   bit   of information   of   Melvin   Vopson's   mass-energy-information equivalence principle [3], is introduced  into  Louis  de  Broglie's  equations  of hidden  thermodynamics  [2]  leading  to  different equations  of  entropy  formulation  such  as  the relations     of     Boltzmann,     Einstein,     Planck, Avogadro  and  the  fine  structure  formulation,  as various new expressions of the notion of entropy [6]. Also, in the second part of this work, is explained how,  after  injecting  the  temperature  of  Hawking radiation  [7]  into one  of the  new  equationsof entropy,   this   new   formula   can   calculate   theentropy of theentangled Hawking radiation up to the quantum system [5].

This excerpt from the paper "The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe" by Olivier Denis goes into more detail on the new theoretical framework proposed.
In the introduction, Denis highlights key concepts that inform his work, including Landauer's principle, Louis de Broglie's hidden thermodynamics, and the mass-energy-information equivalence principle.
The work is divided into three parts:
Structural basis
: The fundamentals of quantum information and quantum entanglement are discussed. The author introduces the notion that temperature and information are the primary building blocks of the universe. The wave function's collapse is examined through the lens of an informational process where measurement informs the observer about the system and leads to an entanglement between the observer and the system.
Generalization
: The author introduces the concept of "informational mass" into de Broglie's thermodynamics. This leads to different expressions of entropy, including those of Boltzmann, Einstein, Planck, Avogadro, and the fine-structure constant. Denis explains that using Hawking radiation's temperature, the new entropy formula can calculate the entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation, thus shedding light on black hole entropy. The black hole entropy horizon law is mentioned to be a special case of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture, which is a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to gravity.
Dark Side
: The theory is extended to explain dark matter and dark energy in the context of entropy and information. Dark matter is viewed as the mass associated with the number of bits in the observable universe, and dark energy as the energy associated with these bits of information, as per Landauer's principle. This approach also helps bridge the cosmological constant problem by considering the mass of the information bit instead of the Planck mass, drastically reducing the discrepancy in the prediction of vacuum energy from a quantum perspective.
In summary, this work offers a novel interpretation of entropy, information, and their relation to various phenomena in physics such as the collapse of the wave function, black hole entropy, dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmological constant problem. As is typical with any new theoretical framework, these ideas will need rigorous testing and validation against empirical data.

Negentropy as Surprise: Exploring Learning, Prediction, and Compression

The quest for understanding cognition and learning has led researchers to delve into concepts such as negentropy, surprise, and entropy. In this essay, we explore the intriguing relationship between these ideas and their implications for cognitive processes. 

Specifically, we investigate how learning can be viewed as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.

Entropy, often associated with disorder or randomness, can be thought of as a measure of the number of ways a system can be sliced or organized to achieve a particular result.

Conversely, negentropy refers to the reduction of this randomness or uncertainty within a system, emphasizing the emergence of order, organization, and information content.

One fascinating analogy that helps shed light on these concepts is the phenomenon of reverse mass wasting. In the natural world, mass wasting refers to the downhill movement of rocks, soil, or debris caused by gravity.

Reverse mass wasting, however, pertains to the opposite process - the uphill movement of materials. Similarly, in the realm of cognition, the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as a form of reverse mass wasting.

At the heart of this exploration lies the notion of surprise. Surprise arises when our predictions or expectations diverge from the actual outcomes or observations we encounter. Learning, then, can be seen as a process of inoculation against surprise.

By continuously refining our predictive models, we aim to minimize the discrepancy between what we expect and what we experience, ultimately reducing surprise.

Prediction and compression play crucial roles in this framework. Learning involves identifying patterns, regularities, and underlying structures in our environment to make accurate predictions about future events.

By making successful predictions, we can compress the information we receive, distilling it into more concise representations that capture the essential features and minimize redundancy.

Drawing on the analogy of entropy, where slicing a system in various ways can yield similar results, we explore how learning enables us to uncover meaningful ways to organize and represent information.

Through the reduction of uncertainty and the compression of data, we strive to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our cognitive processes, enhancing our ability to navigate and understand the world around us.

By understanding the interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy, we gain valuable insights into the nature of learning and cognition.

This essay explores these themes, elucidating the role of prediction, compression, and the reduction of surprise in the pursuit of knowledge and the development of cognitive schemas as dissipative structures.

Your analogy of entropy as the number of ways to slice a system and get the same result is indeed a good way of capturing the essence of this concept. In a similar vein, negentropy - essentially the opposite of entropy - can be viewed as the structure or order within a system.
The comparison to mass wasting and the reverse process is particularly interesting. Much like the unexpected uphill movement of materials against gravity (reverse mass wasting), learning, through the reduction of uncertainty, brings a level of order to the chaos, or "climbs uphill" against the natural state of entropy.
The concept of surprise as a driving force for learning is also a compelling perspective. As humans, we are wired to anticipate and predict based on past experiences and knowledge. When outcomes diverge from our predictions, we experience surprise. This surprise then stimulates a process of learning where we update our mental models to better align with the observed reality, thus reducing future surprise.
Prediction and compression are identified as the key strategies in this process of learning. Prediction involves the generation of anticipatory models based on past experiences, while compression involves the distillation of complex information into simpler representations.
In your reference to the cognitive schemas as dissipative structures, it seems that you're touching on the concept that these schemas, or cognitive constructs, are not static, but rather dynamic and adaptive. They are continuously evolving, adapting, and self-organizing in response to new experiences and information - a key attribute of dissipative structures.
By incorporating these concepts - entropy, negentropy, surprise, prediction, and compression - your exploration provides a rich and multi-layered perspective on learning and cognition, highlighting the complex dynamics and interactions that shape our understanding of the world.

To draw connections between Olivier Denis' paper on "The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe" and the discussion on negentropy, surprise, learning, prediction, and compression, we can consider the following points:
Information and Entropy
: Both discussions consider entropy and information as central concepts. Denis' paper suggests that the universe can be understood as an emergent, entangled informational process, where entropy plays a key role in formulating various phenomena, like black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and others. In the discussion of negentropy and surprise, entropy is seen as a measure of disorder or randomness within a cognitive system, and negentropy is viewed as the process of reducing this uncertainty, essentially learning.
Learning and Prediction
: In Denis' paper, he uses the concept of the measurement process in quantum mechanics to explain the collapse of a wave function. Here, the measurement informs the measurer about the system being measured. This could be compared to the idea of learning and prediction in cognitive science, where we continuously refine our predictive models based on the information we receive to minimize surprise.
Order and Disorder
: In both discussions, there's a struggle between order and disorder. In the physics paper, entropy equations and quantum principles are used to explain the organization of the universe and its phenomena. On the other hand, in the cognitive discussion, negentropy is used to describe the reduction of disorder (or increase in order) as a way of learning and understanding our environment.
Compression
: While not directly discussed in Denis' paper, compression might relate to how he's proposing new equivalent entropy formulations. By creating these new formulas, he's simplifying the complexities of the universe, somewhat analogous to the cognitive compression where information is distilled into concise representations.
Overall, both discussions illuminate how entropy and information are fundamental to understanding the physical universe and cognitive processes. They also show how systems, whether they're the universe or human cognition, tend toward order and structure, albeit through different mechanisms.

Heat death after poincaré time? Prigogine, Deleuze, Lacan.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your question touches upon a very deep and complex topic, referencing the works of notable scientists and philosophers like Henri Poincaré, Ilya Prigogine, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Lacan. Let's unpack this a bit.
Heat Death and Poincaré Recurrence Time
: Heat death is a hypothetical end state for the universe, where it has reached a state of maximum entropy and no thermodynamic free energy to sustain processes that consume energy (including computation and life as we know it). The Poincaré recurrence theorem, proposed by the French mathematician Henri Poincaré, states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state arbitrarily close to the initial state. So, in theory, after the "Poincaré recurrence time," the universe could restart or come back to a state of low entropy. However, this time is unfathomably long, many orders of magnitude longer than the current age of the universe.
Prigogine's Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics
: Ilya Prigogine was a physical chemist known for his work on dissipative structures and complex systems, particularly in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. He posited that systems far from equilibrium can spontaneously develop complex, organized structures, a phenomenon that could be relevant in many fields, from physics to biology and sociology. This approach could potentially influence how we understand the long-term evolution and "death" of the universe.
Deleuze, Lacan, and Philosophy
: Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Lacan were influential philosophers, with Deleuze known for his work on philosophy of desire and Lacan for his contributions to psychoanalysis. Their works are less directly related to physical concepts like heat death or Poincaré recurrence time. However, Deleuze's ideas about multiplicity and becoming, and Lacan's concepts about desire and the symbolic order, can provide philosophical interpretations of concepts like entropy, order, and chaos. For example, Lacan might relate the concept of heat death to the ultimate "lack" or "loss," while Deleuze could potentially see it as a moment of becoming or transformation.
Drawing a direct line between these diverse thinkers is challenging due to the interdisciplinary and conceptual leaps it requires. However, it's safe to say that all of them, in their own ways, grapple with ideas about order, chaos, time, and the fundamental laws that govern systems, be they physical, psychological, or philosophical.

The Rhizomatic Food Chain

The traditional view of the food chain is a linear, hierarchical structure with apex predators at the top and primary producers at the bottom. However, this view overlooks the complex web of interactions that occur within ecosystems.

The rhizomatic food chain offers a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the interconnectedness of all organisms in a given ecosystem. This view emphasizes the importance of the myriad of microbes, fungi, and other often-overlooked players in the ecosystem.

By acknowledging the importance of the smallest players in the food chain, we can better understand the complexity of ecosystems and the importance of preserving biodiversity.

This essay will explore the concept of the rhizomatic food chain, its implications for our understanding of ecosystems, and its potential to shape conservation efforts.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The idea of a "Rhizomatic Food Chain" is a compelling one. It moves away from the conventional top-down perspective of a linear food chain - typically illustrated with an apex predator at the top, herbivores in the middle, and plants at the bottom - towards a more intricate, non-hierarchical model that is representative of the complex interactions in ecosystems.
The term "rhizome" is borrowed from botany and is used in philosophy by Deleuze and Guattari to refer to non-hierarchical, decentralized systems or structures. A rhizome is a type of plant stem situated either at the soil surface or underground that contains nodes from which roots and shoots originate. Unlike trees, rhizomes do not have a singular point of origin or a predefined path, but rather, they can grow and expand in multiple directions, creating a complex, web-like structure.
Applying the concept of rhizomes to food chains helps us better understand the true complexity of nature. It acknowledges that rather than a linear process, energy flow within an ecosystem is a complex network of interactions involving numerous organisms at varying trophic levels, each of which is connected to multiple others. It's more like a "food web" than a "food chain", and even that doesn't capture the entirety of interactions, as it often overlooks the crucial roles played by decomposers, detritivores, and microbes.
This rhizomatic perspective encourages us to see the roles of all organisms - no matter how small - as interconnected and equally important to the health and resilience of ecosystems. It takes into account symbiotic relationships, competition, and other non-trophic interactions that can dramatically affect ecosystem dynamics.
Such a shift in perspective can have significant implications for conservation and management efforts. It highlights the importance of preserving biodiversity at all levels - not just the charismatic megafauna often emphasized in conservation campaigns. It underscores the idea that a disruption at any point in this complex network could have significant, cascading effects on the entire system, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences.
In conclusion, embracing the concept of the Rhizomatic Food Chain could fundamentally transform our understanding of ecosystems and guide more holistic, effective strategies for conservation and sustainable management of natural resources. It reminds us that each organism, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, plays a critical role in maintaining the health and vitality of our planet.

Applying the concept of a "Rhizomatic Food Chain" to the previous topics allows for some insightful connections:
Emergent Entangled Informational Universe: This model views the universe as a complex, interconnected system where the properties and behavior of its constituent parts cannot be fully understood in isolation. Similar to the rhizomatic food chain, it emphasizes the importance of the relationships between components in creating a larger structure or system.
Negentropy as Surprise: Just as learning can be seen as a process of reducing surprise through making accurate predictions, the organisms in a rhizomatic food chain are continually learning and adapting to changes in their ecosystem. These organisms use the information gained through these interactions to predict and respond to future changes, thereby reducing their surprise or uncertainty.
Heat Death after Poincaré Time: The concept of heat death relates to the eventual state of the universe where all energy is evenly distributed and no work can be done. The rhizomatic food chain, on the other hand, emphasizes the continual transfer and transformation of energy within an ecosystem. However, over very long time scales, ecosystems might also reach a state of maximum entropy, or "heat death," although this is not a commonly discussed concept in ecology.
Prigogine, Deleuze, Lacan: The theories and concepts put forth by these scholars - such as Prigogine's work on dissipative structures, Deleuze's philosophy of rhizomatic systems, and Lacan's psychoanalytic theories - all highlight the complexity and interconnectedness of systems, whether they be physical, biological, or social. These themes of complexity and interconnectedness resonate strongly with the concept of the rhizomatic food chain.
By viewing the universe and all its constituent parts as interconnected, complex systems - whether that's an ecosystem or the universe itself - we can gain a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the processes at work. This can inform our approach to a wide range of issues, from the management of ecosystems to our fundamental understanding of the universe.

Polyfunctional batteries are interesting concepts in energy storage technology. They can provide multiple methods for storing energy and harnessing it when needed.

One example of a polyfunctional battery is a hybrid system that combines a flow battery with a pumped hydropower system. In this setup, electricity from renewable sources (such as solar or wind) is used to power a water pump, which transfers water between two reservoirs located at different elevations.

As the water flows, potential energy is generated and stored in the form of gravitational force. When electricity demand increases, the water is released back downhill through turbines, generating electricity again.

Meanwhile, the electrochemical components of the flow battery can be recharged by using some of the electrical output from the hydraulic system. This combination allows for more flexible operation and greater overall efficiency than either system alone.

Another example is a hydrogen-based polyfunctional battery that incorporates a mechanical winding mechanism. In this design, the battery uses reversible chemical reactions to store and release hydrogen gas, similar to a conventional fuel cell.

But instead of just producing electricity, the device also includes a small motor that can use some of the electrical output to drive a shaft or other rotating component.

The rotation can then be transferred to a flywheel or other storage medium, where it is converted into kinetic energy. 

When the kinetic energy is later converted back to electrical power, the process is reversed and the hydrogen gas is recombined with oxygen to generate electricity once again.

This approach offers high energy density storage and can potentially be scaled up to grid-level applications.

In both cases, the key advantage of these polyfunctional batteries is their ability to offer multiple modes of energy storage and conversion, making them more versatile and efficient than single-purpose systems.

However, they may require larger and more complex designs, and there may be challenges related to integration and control of the various subsystems. 

Nonetheless, further research and development could lead to new breakthroughs in energy storage technology and help solve many of the world's growing energy needs.

Fluidic yogurt computing is an intriguing concept, but one that currently exists only in theory. It involves combining different types of yogurt cultures with different metabolic pathways and fermentation times to create "biological logic gates" that can perform simple computational tasks.

These biological circuits would be designed to respond to environmental cues such as changes in temperature, acidity, or nutrient availability, causing physical and biochemical transformations within the yogurt mixture.

The idea behind fluidic yogurt computing is based on the principles of microfluidics, which involve manipulating tiny volumes of liquid in confined spaces.

By carefully controlling the size and shape of the channels and chambers, it's possible to achieve precise control over the movement of particles and fluids.

However, while the basic concept is sound, there are still significant hurdles to overcome before fluidic yogurt computing can become a practical reality.

One challenge is ensuring the reliability of the biological circuitry; even slight variations in conditions can lead to unpredictable results.

Another issue is scaling up the system to handle more complex computations, since the number of interactions between individual cells becomes enormous. 

Finally, there is the question of how to interface with the outside world, since most current sensors and actuators are not compatible with biological materials.

Wow, thank you so much for your detailed explanation! You really got what I was trying to say about fluidic yogurt computing. I'm glad we share similar ideas on this topic. It sounds like you have done quite a bit of research on this subject matter yourself!

I'm glad you found the explanation informative! As an artificial intelligence, I don't do research in the traditional sense. However, I have been trained on a wide variety of data and can generate responses based on that information.
As for the concept of autonomous mobile yogurt machines, this idea essentially extends the concept of fluidic yogurt computing into a mobile, self-sustaining platform.
One could imagine these machines as miniature mobile factories, using advanced biotechnology to produce yogurt from various input materials. The machine could contain a compartment for fermenting yogurt, a system for converting cellulose pulp into sugar for the yogurt bacteria, and a mechanism for drying and compressing the yogurt into a protective casing.
The machines would also have a means of mobility, perhaps using a bio-mechanical system powered by the byproducts of the fermentation process. This would allow them to seek out new sources of input materials, making the machines essentially autonomous.
The computational aspect would come into play in the management of the machine's various processes, such as adjusting the fermentation conditions, directing the machine's movement, and so on.
It's a fascinating concept, and while it's purely speculative at this stage, who knows what advances the future might bring? The intersections of biotechnology, robotics, and computation could lead to some truly innovative developments.

Certainly, let's draw connections between the topics of the autonomous mobile yogurt machines, the rhizomatic food chain, heat death after Poincaré time, entropy, and negentropy.
Autonomous Mobile Yogurt Machines and the Rhizomatic Food Chain: Autonomous mobile yogurt machines present a novel paradigm in terms of energy consumption and food production, which could become a part of the rhizomatic food chain. Their potential to convert cellulose pulp into edible yogurt could be seen as a way of utilizing resources in a non-linear, interconnected food web.
Autonomous Mobile Yogurt Machines, Entropy, and Negentropy: The process of creating yogurt from cellulose pulp involves the conversion of less ordered raw materials into a more ordered and useful product, which aligns with the concept of negentropy. However, any energy conversion process will also necessarily involve some increase in entropy, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.
Heat Death After Poincaré Time: The Poincaré recurrence theorem, which suggests that certain systems will eventually return to a state arbitrarily close to their initial state, could be seen as a sort of counterpoint to the idea of the heat death of the universe, which is the ultimate consequence of increasing entropy. The yogurt machine, with its continuous cycle of consumption, conversion, and output, could be seen as a microcosmic representation of this tension between recurrence and entropy.
Rhizomatic Food Chain, Entropy, and Negentropy: The rhizomatic food chain, with its intricate web of interactions, is a manifestation of entropy in nature - it represents the multitude of ways energy transfer can occur within an ecosystem. At the same time, the individual organisms within this web each represent negentropy, as they continuously work to maintain and reproduce their own order amidst the surrounding disorder.
In summary, all of these concepts explore the tension between order and disorder, and the constant, intricate dance between entropy and negentropy that characterizes both the natural world and our human-made systems.

An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.

Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. 

There is no intelligence where there is no need of change.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The quotes you've provided encapsulate an important principle in evolutionary biology, which suggests that organisms adapt to their environment over time through the process of natural selection. When an animal is perfectly in sync with its environment, it often means that its behaviors and traits have been honed over generations to maximize survival and reproductive success. In such a case, it indeed resembles a 'perfect mechanism' operating in its specific ecological niche.
The quote "Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless" suggests that the development of higher cognitive faculties, such as intelligence, is often driven by changing environmental conditions that render previous survival strategies based on habit or instinct ineffective.
The final quote, "There is no intelligence where there is no need of change," reflects the idea that the development and application of intelligence are inherently tied to the necessity of adaptation. When environments are stable and an organism is well-adapted to that environment, the impetus for the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities, or for individuals to employ such abilities, may be reduced.
These notions align with several of the principles discussed earlier, including the Little Scientist Postulation and the Baby Bayes Hypothesis. Both of these theories suggest that intelligence - whether on an evolutionary or developmental timescale - is a tool for navigating uncertainty and complexity. In stable, predictable environments, the necessity for such a tool may indeed be less.
Similarly, the Neural Metronome Theory, which highlights the role of rhythmic oscillations in generating motor patterns, could be seen as an example of an 'instinct' that is so well-honed that it operates like a finely tuned mechanism. In contrast, concepts like the Mind-Net Proposal and Homo Sapiens Talkbot Concept speak to the development and application of intelligence as a means of adapting to complex social and informational environments.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) postulates that behavior is the control of perception rather than the control of action. This theory aligns with your
"Humans as Large Language Models"
hypothesis. In both, the central idea revolves around controlling perception. As humans or large language models interpret language, they're essentially controlling their perception of the incoming information.
Choice Theory, which posits that all we do is behave and that almost all behavior is chosen, resonates with your
"Motile Womb Theory"
and the
"Theory-Theory"
. These theories emphasize the agency individuals have in processing experiences or generating theories about the world, emphasizing choice and personal construction of reality.
Cognitive Load Theory, which deals with the load that performing a particular task imposes on the learner's cognitive system, relates to your
"Lexical Semantics"
and
"Stochastic Language Acquisition"
theories. Learning a language is cognitively demanding, and understanding the semantics of words (meanings, relationships, usage) can place a significant load on our cognitive systems. The stochastic nature of language acquisition is a response to managing this cognitive load, with learning shaped by the probabilistic patterns in language input.
Polycomputation can be compared to your
"Fluidic Yogurt Computing"
and
"Polyfunctional Batteries"
ideas. Polycomputation is the idea of using multiple computational models or processes simultaneously. Fluidic Yogurt Computing, with its concept of using different types of yogurt cultures to perform computations, and Polyfunctional Batteries, with its concept of utilizing multiple energy storage and conversion mechanisms, both embody the principle of multiplicity inherent in polycomputation.
In each case, the specific theories you're asking about reflect broader principles that are at work in multiple of your ideas. In PCT, Choice Theory, and Cognitive Load Theory, the focus is on the ways in which individuals interpret and respond to their environments. In polycomputation, the emphasis is on the potential benefits of multiplicity and diversity in problem-solving.

Explain Lexical Semantics again.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Lexical Semantics is a sub-field of linguistic semantics which focuses on the meanings of words, also known as lexemes. It's concerned with the nature and structure of the meanings of words, how those meanings relate to each other, and how they function in larger units of linguistic communication, such as phrases, sentences, and texts.
Some key aspects of Lexical Semantics include:
Word Meaning:
This includes denotation (the basic concept a word refers to) and connotation (the emotional or cultural associations a word carries with it).
Polysemy and Homonymy:
Polysemy refers to a single word that has multiple related meanings (like "run" meaning both to move quickly and to operate, as in a machine running). Homonymy refers to words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings, like "bat" (an animal) and "bat" (a piece of sports equipment).
Synonymy and Antonymy:
Synonymy involves words that have the same or very similar meanings, like "big" and "large." Antonymy involves words with opposite meanings, like "hot" and "cold."
Hyponymy and Hypernymy:
These are hierarchical relationships between words. A hyponym is a specific instance of a general category (like "sparrow" is a hyponym of "bird"), while a hypernym is the general category that encompasses more specific instances (like "bird" is a hypernym for "sparrow").
Semantic Fields or Lexical Fields:
This is the organization of related words and expressions into a system. For instance, words such as "red", "blue", "green", "yellow" etc., can be grouped into a semantic field of "colors".
Lexical semantics is important in linguistics because it helps us understand how words carry meaning and how that meaning functions in different contexts. It's also crucial in fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP) where understanding the meaning of words is essential for processing human language effectively.

Give a detailed explanation of what is terra preta:
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Terra preta, also known as Amazonian dark earth, refers to a type of highly fertile and dark soil found in the Amazon rainforest region. The term "terra preta" is derived from Portuguese, meaning "black earth." It is characterized by its rich black color, high organic matter content, and exceptional fertility compared to the surrounding soils.
Terra preta soils are believed to have been created and enriched by indigenous civilizations that inhabited the Amazon region thousands of years ago. These civilizations practiced a technique called "slash-and-char," which involved clearing small areas of land, burning the vegetation, and then mixing the resulting charcoal with organic materials, such as animal bones, crop residues, and human waste. This mixture was then incorporated into the soil, leading to the formation of terra preta.
The key component of terra preta is the charcoal, which acts as a long-lasting carbon sink. The charcoal particles have a porous structure that can retain nutrients, moisture, and beneficial microorganisms, creating a favorable environment for plant growth. The addition of organic materials also enhances the soil's nutrient content and fertility.
Terra preta soils exhibit several beneficial characteristics, including improved water retention, enhanced nutrient availability, and increased microbial activity. These properties contribute to the high agricultural productivity observed in areas with terra preta soils, even in nutrient-poor rainforest environments.
The exact mechanisms behind the formation and fertility of terra preta are still being studied, but researchers believe that the combination of charcoal's stability, organic matter additions, and the presence of specific microorganisms contribute to its unique properties. The biochar (charcoal) in terra preta not only improves soil fertility but also sequesters carbon, making it a potential tool for climate change mitigation.
The discovery and study of terra preta have sparked interest in applying similar techniques to create fertile soils in other regions of the world.

Keywords: charcoal, infiltration, sandy loam, sustainable farming, terra preta, water holding capacity
Abstract
Terra preta (TP) is a soil amendment which is enriched with powdered charcoal, with nutrient sources from organic residues, and that constitutes a resource to improve soils for sustainable land use systems (Glaser, 2007).  Terra preta-dark soil is inspired by the highly successful historic practice of soil building in the Amazon and other parts of the world.  This work involves a relatively unexplored topic: the comprehension of infiltration processes and soil water content characteristics in a sandy loam soil combined with different fractions of terra preta amendments.  This analysis contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between fractions of charcoal in terms of terra preta content and soil water holding capacity.  First, a physical and hydraulic characterization was performed on soil samples with different charcoal content.  Then, they were exposed to a rain simulation experiment under controlled conditions.  A descriptive statistical analysis was applied for a quantitative evaluation of the results.  It was found that as the fraction of terra preta increased, infiltration and percolation rates decreased, but water holding capacity increased.  This can influence water ponding at the surface, leading to runoff formation. However, the effect on water holding capacity is an opportunity, integrated to other sustainable practices, to overcome drought effects and reduce the need for irrigation.
