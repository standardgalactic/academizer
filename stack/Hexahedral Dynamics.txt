The Insight Map of "Esoteric Christianity: Two Kinds of Religion" by Ken Wilber and Corey deVos offers a comprehensive overview of different aspects of spirituality and religion, including the individual, collective, interior, and exterior perspectives. It also touches upon integral spirituality and polarities that come into play in the spiritual journey.
From an individual perspective, the authors highlight the influence of one's developmental stage on the interpretation of spiritual teachings and experiences. They mention that spiritual paths may not necessarily eliminate psychological issues and advocate for the integration of spirituality with psychotherapy for holistic growth.
The collective perspective sheds light on the importance of interfaith dialogue for recognizing commonalities among different religions and promoting peaceful coexistence. It also highlights the critical role of community in supporting individual spiritual growth.
From the interior perspective, the authors emphasize that both exoteric (outward-facing, dogmatic) and esoteric (inner, mystical) forms of religious practice exist at every developmental stage. They suggest that perceived conflict between science and religion can be mitigated by acknowledging rational and trans-rational aspects of religion, and they underscore the importance of a nuanced understanding of spiritual practices.
The exterior perspective focuses on the societal impacts of religious practice. It highlights that while exoteric forms of religion can source societal conflict, esoteric forms can liberate individuals from suffering.
In terms of integral spirituality, the authors present two key polarities: Esoteric Traditions vs Exoteric Traditions, and Waking Up vs Growing Up. The integration of these polarities, according to the authors, leads to an 'Integrated Heart & Mind' which is central to integral spirituality.
Overall, this map serves as a multi-dimensional framework for understanding and exploring spirituality, offering insights into the complexities and interplay of different aspects of spiritual growth and practice.

For the interior perspective I imagine a personality called Adlerian Individualism and for the exterior Rhizome Deleuzian.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're looking to map the ideas of Adlerian Individualism and Deleuzian Rhizome onto the interior and exterior perspectives of the Integral Model.
Adlerian Individualism could indeed map onto the "interior" quadrant, as this theory deals with individual psychology. Alfred Adler's theories focus on the subjective experience of the individual, emphasizing their unique perception and interpretation of the world, which clearly fits into the interior individual quadrant. Adler's theory emphasizes concepts like striving for superiority, the importance of social interest, the significance of birth order, and the crucial role of lifestyle in shaping the individual's psyche, all of which are interior, subjective phenomena.
Deleuzian Rhizome, a concept derived from the philosophical work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, could be mapped onto the "exterior" quadrants. Deleuze and Guattari use the rhizome as a metaphor for thinking about systems and structures. Instead of viewing things hierarchically (like a tree structure), they propose a non-hierarchical (rhizomatic) model. This maps onto the exterior quadrants in the sense that it concerns objective systems, structures, and networks - both in terms of collective systems (exterior collective quadrant) and the behavior of individuals in those systems (exterior individual quadrant). In this model, any point can be connected to any other point, embracing diversity, multiplicity, and interconnectedness.
Remember that any mapping of theories onto the quadrants of the Integral Model is a simplification and abstraction. The full depth and complexity of these theories can't be fully captured in any model. The map is not the territory, but a tool for navigating it.

What are the characteristics of the other two quadrants?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The four quadrants in Ken Wilber's Integral Theory represent different dimensions or perspectives of reality, and each has distinct characteristics. You've already touched on the individual interior (upper-left) and collective exterior (lower-right) quadrants. Let's explore the other two:
Individual Exterior (Upper-Right Quadrant):
This quadrant involves the observable behavior and physical manifestation of individual entities. For a human being, it includes things like the biological and neurological processes, genetic makeup, physical health and fitness, and visible behaviors. It covers the objective aspects of an individual's existence, those which can be observed and measured from an external viewpoint. It's the realm often explored by sciences like biology, neuroscience, and behaviorism.
Collective Interior (Lower-Left Quadrant):
This quadrant encompasses the shared interior experiences of collective entities, such as the values, beliefs, and cultural norms of groups, societies, and civilizations. It includes shared worldviews, moral codes, myths, languages, and traditions that bind a group together. The lower-left quadrant addresses the intersubjective aspects of reality - the shared interior experiences that form the basis of culture and community. Fields like sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies often explore this quadrant.
Remember, in Integral Theory, all four quadrants are interconnected and influence each other. For a comprehensive understanding of any phenomenon, all four perspectives need to be taken into account.

Ok for 1. I want to use Fatima al-Fihriya and for 2. Theano a student of Pythagoras who takes over management of his school in his old age.

That sounds like a wonderful approach, bringing historical figures into the quadrants to represent their characteristics. Here's a brief overview of how Fatima al-Fihriya and Theano might embody the qualities of their respective quadrants:
Individual Exterior (Upper-Right Quadrant) - Fatima al-Fihriya:
Fatima al-Fihriya, a Muslim woman from the 9th century, is renowned for founding the world's oldest existing, continually operating university, the University of Al Quaraouiyine in Fez, Morocco. As an individual, she devoted her wealth and energy to creating a physical institution - an embodiment of the upper-right quadrant's focus on observable, external actions. Fatima al-Fihriya's actions led to tangible impacts on individual and societal education.
Collective Interior (Lower-Left Quadrant) - Theano:
Theano, a philosopher, mathematician, and one of Pythagoras's students (and possibly his wife), took over the leadership of his school after his death. She symbolizes the lower-left quadrant through her contribution to the shared intellectual and philosophical culture of Pythagorean followers. By leading the school, she would have played a significant role in shaping the shared interior experiences of the students and the collective understanding of Pythagorean teachings. This leadership role in maintaining and evolving a shared worldview aligns well with the characteristics of the lower-left quadrant.
Please note that these are metaphorical assignments. In real life, every individual operates in all four quadrants - their interior thoughts and feelings, their exterior actions, and their roles within both their immediate social circles and broader society.

Given that this model interweaves philosophy, individualism, collectivism, interior perspectives, and exterior actions, a suitable name could be "Interwoven Quadrants of Philosophical Perspectives". However, naming is subjective and can be tailored to the specific application or audience for this model. You could choose something more specific or abstract depending on your needs.

ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Ken Wilber and Corey deVos didn't specifically provide a title for the insight map that you mentioned. Their conversations often involve exploring various aspects of Integral Theory, including perspectives from individual to collective and interior to exterior. The concepts of "waking up" and "growing up" are common themes, as are various stages of spiritual, moral, and cognitive development.

It was in the article we discussed earlier, Al as "Other" & Al as Extension of Self, I thought it was esoteric Christianity: two kinds of religious experience, or something like that.

Apologies for the confusion. Yes, the discussion between Ken Wilber and Corey deVos titled "Esoteric Christianity: Two Kinds of Religion" focused on exploring various aspects of Integral Theory in the context of spiritual and religious practices. The insight map they discuss can be thought of as a framework for understanding different interpretations and approaches to spirituality, viewed through the lens of both exoteric and esoteric Christian practices.
However, the term "insight map" itself does not appear to be a formal title that they've used, but more of a conceptual tool or framework. The title of their discussion, "Esoteric Christianity: Two Kinds of Religion," does not directly apply to the insight map you've constructed here, which has a broader focus beyond Christianity.
Therefore, the model you've created can be named in a way that captures its integration of philosophical thought and learning theories, as well as the integral approach of individual-collective and interior-exterior quadrants. A title like "Integral Map of Philosophical Learning Perspectives" might be suitable, but feel free to adjust it to better represent your specific intentions with the model.

It seems you're sharing a version of Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, which posits that all knowledge and experience can be placed into a four-quadrant grid, across the axes of "interior/exterior" and "individual/collective".
Regarding your earlier query about naming your model that involves four philosophers in the four quadrants of interior/exterior and individual/collective, how about something like "Quadrant Philosophers & AI Integration" or "Integral Philosophy Perspectives in AI"?
If you would like a title that directly reflects the Spiral Dynamics Integral concept, you might consider "Spiral Dynamics Integral: Philosophical Perspectives in AI".
These are just suggestions and the final title should best reflect your intentions and the essence of your model.

Abstract
A small perturbation of a quadratic polynomial f with a non-repelling fixed point gives a polynomial g with an attracting fixed point and a Jordan curve Julia set, on which g acts like angle doubling. However, there are cubic polynomials with a non-repelling fixed point, for which no perturbation results into a polynomial with Jordan curve Julia set. Motivated by the study of the closure of the Cubic Principal Hyperbolic Domain, we describe such polynomials in terms of their quadratic-like restrictions.

"Hexahedral Dynamics" does indeed sound like an intriguing and apt title for your model, considering that you're looking at eight different perspectives (the eight philosophers). Associating them with the vertices of a cube adds a layer of depth and interconnectedness to the model, reminiscent of a three-dimensional version of the quadrant model, like a hypercube or tesseract in higher dimensions.
The additional context you've provided, such as associating specific philosophical perspectives or concepts with the vertices of a tesseract, adds an even greater degree of complexity and multi-dimensionality to the model. It makes it a truly integral model that captures diverse philosophical perspectives across multiple dimensions, encompassing individual and collective, interior and exterior aspects.
It's important to note that such a model would require careful explanation and interpretation to ensure that the philosophical concepts are accurately represented in the hypercube and that their positions in the model accurately reflect their relationships and interactions with each other.
In summary, "Hexahedral Dynamics: An Integral Philosophy Model in AI" seems like a fitting title for your model.
