High Culture Characteristics
Summarize: Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides literature includes music, visual arts (especially painting), and traditional forms of the performing arts (including some cinema). The decorative arts would not generally be considered high art.[11]

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high civilization, for which a large, sophisticated, and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the visual arts, sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints, though many more could be found on the cultural and economic side. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the Renaissance onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.
High culture refers to the appreciation of various art forms, including literature, music, visual arts (especially painting), and traditional performing arts. It is often associated with periods of high civilization that provide a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, as well as the resources needed to support artistic creation. High culture typically excludes the decorative arts and is often linked to the Greco-Roman tradition, although similar conditions have existed in other places at different times.
Summarize: In a society, high culture is the subculture that encompasses the cultural objects of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as being exemplary works of art,[1] and the intellectual works of literature and music, history and philosophy, which a society consider representative of their culture.[2]

Definition
In popular usage, the term high culture identifies the culture either of the upper class (an aristocracy) or of a status class (the intelligentsia); high culture also identifies a society's common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term high culture is contrasted with the term low culture, which comprises the forms of popular culture characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the barbarians, the Philistines, and hoi polloi (the masses)
High culture refers to the subculture within a society that values cultural objects of aesthetic value, such as literature, music, history, and philosophy. It is often associated with the upper class or the intelligentsia, but also encompasses the broad-range knowledge and traditions of folk culture. High culture is distinguished from low culture, which includes popular culture forms associated with the less-educated social classes.
Ok now write a prose poem about these topics and about how poetry can take any form, it doesn't have to rhyme or have metre, it doesn't have to be long or use fancy flowery language, that is a junior high school notion of art. Call it "this is just to say"
This is just to say,
That poetry is more than just the words we say.
It can be a subculture, a society's high art,
Representative of its knowledge, tradition, and heart.
From literature to music, history to philosophy,
The value of high culture is far from mere novelty.
It speaks to the essence of a civilization's soul,
A treasure trove of beauty, depth, and stories untold.
But poetry itself need not be fancy or grand,
It can take any form, be it short, long, or unplanned.
It doesn't need to rhyme or follow a strict metre,
Its power lies in the emotions that it can stir.
So let us not limit our notion of art,
To something that we learned in junior high school as a start.
For poetry is a vast and wondrous sea,
Where anyone can find their voice and be free.
Ok but I didn't like you using say in the first line, you shouldn't rhyme a word with itself it makes it seem juvenile.
My apologies, let me try again:
Let me tell you, friend,
That poetry is more than just the words we tend
to use when we write or speak.
It's a subculture that we seek
that represents the high art of a society's soul,
where knowledge, tradition, and beauty unfold.
From literature to music, history to philosophy,
the value of high culture is far from mere novelty.
It speaks to the essence of a civilization's heart,
a treasure trove of emotions, depth, and stories that never part.
But poetry itself needs no grandiose words or flowery style,
it can take any form, long or short, without any guile.
No need for rhymes or strict meter to measure its art,
for its power lies in the feelings it can impart.
So let us not limit our notion of what poetry can be,
for its diversity and depth will always set us free.
