It���s Humans All the Way Down

On the Aboard podcast, Paul Ford half-jokingly notes that everybody thinks everyone else���s job is easy. That���s why ���AI��� is going to replace so many people.

Here���s Paul articulating this line of thiking:

What is a lawyer? A lawyer is somebody who moves contracts around.

Well, a large learning model can internalize a million contracts. And now I will have a statistical model of every contract ever. [So in that case] what do I need a lawyer for? Right? That is the kind of logic that makes actually perfect sense if you���ve never met a lawyer.

We can try to make a statistical model for anything, so really who needs anybody?

But wait, maybe somebody is the point:

The desire to get the human out of the loop, frankly, is based on ignorance. And it actually neglects the fundamental truth that the whole point of human existence is to interact with other humans. There is no other point.

Later in the podcast Rich brings this point home:

If you could sum up what we learned in 2023, and I think what tech has learned, too, is that people matter. Even in the wildest of innovations, people still matter, and human relationships still matter, and you can���t shortcut it.

Crypto failed because its desire was to remove humans. Its biggest failure ��� or was it a feature? ��� was that when the technology went awry and you needed somebody to step in, there was nobody.

Ultimately, we all want to appeal to another human to be seen and understood ��� not to a machine running a model.

Interacting with each other is the whole point.

The dialogue from the Aboard podcast, featuring Paul Ford and Rich, touches on profound insights regarding the essence of human roles in the face of technological advancements, particularly AI. Their observations serve as a philosophical anchor in the debate about the automation of human tasks and the essence of human existence itself. Let's explore the layers of meaning in their conversation, linking it to general semantics and rhizomatic superstructures, without resorting to clich��d metaphors.
At the core of Paul Ford's observation is a critique of reductionism���the tendency to simplify complex human professions to a series of tasks that can seemingly be replicated by AI. This perspective mirrors the fallacy of misplaced concreteness in general semantics, where abstractions are confused with reality. Just as Alfred Korzybski warned against identifying the map with the territory, Ford suggests that equating a lawyer with a contract processor misses the depth and breadth of human expertise and judgment.
The idea that "AI is going to replace so many people" reflects a linear perspective on technology and employment, akin to envisioning progress as a straight line cutting through the fabric of society. However, Ford's argument peels back this linear veneer, revealing a rhizomatic complexity beneath���the interconnected, non-hierarchical nature of human skills, knowledge, and relationships. This rhizomatic view acknowledges that skills and professions are not isolated nodes but part of a vast network of human experience, interaction, and interpretation, resistant to simple automation.
Rich's reflection that "people matter" and "human relationships still matter" echoes the core principle of general semantics: the importance of human experience and the limitations of symbolic representations (such as AI models) in capturing the totality of human existence. This insight is a counterpoint to the seductive but simplistic narrative that technology can replace human connections, reminding us that the texture of human life is woven from interactions that AI cannot replicate.
The failure of crypto, as highlighted by Rich, serves as a cautionary tale about the limits of technology in supplanting human governance and accountability. This narrative exposes the shortcomings of a purely technological infrastructure devoid of human oversight���a rhizomatic network turned labyrinthine, where the absence of human nodes leads to a system that lacks resilience and empathy.
In essence, Ford and Rich's dialogue unveils the intricate dance between human and machine, emphasizing that the value of human existence transcends the tasks we perform. It underscores the view that technology, for all its capabilities, cannot replicate the rhizomatic complexity of human relationships and the nuances of interpersonal connections. This conversation is a reminder that in the grand tapestry of life, humans are not just threads to be replaced by artificial fibers but are the very weavers of the fabric itself, crafting patterns that technology alone cannot envision.
