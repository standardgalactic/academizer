Immortal Jellyfish Facts
Write me a encyclopedia style entry about the immortal jellyfish,. In response to physical damage or even starvation, they take a leap back in their development process, transforming back into a polyp. In a process that looks remarkably like immortality, the born-again polyp colony eventually buds and releases medusae that are genetically identical to the injured adult
The Immortal Jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii) is a species of jellyfish that is known for its ability to revert back to its immature polyp stage after reaching maturity. This process, called transdifferentiation, allows the jellyfish to essentially start its life cycle over again, leading to its nickname of the "immortal" jellyfish.
The immortal jellyfish is a small species, typically only reaching a diameter of about 4.5 millimeters. It is found primarily in the Mediterranean Sea, but has also been found in other parts of the world, including the waters of Japan and the United States.
When the immortal jellyfish is injured or threatened by starvation, it will begin the process of transdifferentiation. During this process, the mature jellyfish will transform back into a polyp, which will then develop into a new colony. This new colony will eventually bud and release medusae, which are genetically identical to the injured adult.
This ability to revert back to an earlier stage of development and essentially "start over" is what makes the immortal jellyfish unique among known species. It is currently not known how widespread this ability is among jellyfish, but scientists are studying the immortal jellyfish to learn more about this phenomenon and its potential implications for other organisms.

The Immortal Jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii) is a species of jellyfish known for its ability to revert back to an immature stage of development and start its life cycle over again. This process, called transdifferentiation, allows the jellyfish to potentially live indefinitely. The species is small and primarily found in the Mediterranean Sea but also in other parts of the world. Scientists are studying the species to learn more about its unique ability and potential implications for other organisms.
