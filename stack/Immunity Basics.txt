Innate immunity

Innate immunity, also known as natural or nonspecific immunity, is the first line of defense that the body employs against pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. It is a rapid, general immune response that is present from birth and does not require prior exposure to the specific pathogen.
Innate immunity includes various physical, chemical, and cellular barriers that act collectively to prevent the entry and spread of pathogens in the body. These barriers include:
Physical Barriers: The skin forms a physical barrier that prevents pathogens from entering the body. Mucous membranes, such as those lining the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, also serve as barriers.
Chemical Barriers: Various substances in the body have antimicrobial properties. For example, enzymes in saliva and tears can kill bacteria, and the acidic environment in the stomach can destroy many pathogens. Additionally, antimicrobial peptides and proteins, such as defensins, are present in various body fluids and can directly kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens.
Cellular Barriers: Cells of the innate immune system play a crucial role in identifying and eliminating pathogens. These cells include phagocytes (e.g., neutrophils and macrophages), natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells. Phagocytes engulf and destroy pathogens, NK cells kill infected cells, and dendritic cells present antigens to initiate an adaptive immune response.
Inflammatory Response: When tissues are injured or infected, the innate immune system triggers an inflammatory response. This response involves the release of chemical mediators, such as histamine and cytokines, which increase blood flow to the site of infection or injury. Inflammation helps to isolate and eliminate pathogens, and it also promotes tissue repair.
Innate immunity is fast-acting and provides immediate protection against a wide range of pathogens. However, it is not specific to particular pathogens and does not confer long-lasting immunity. For a more targeted and specific immune response, the adaptive immune system comes into play, which develops over time in response to exposure to specific pathogens or antigens.

Epigenetic immunity is a form of immune protection that involves changes in gene expression or modifications of the chromatin structure that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. This type of immunity can be influenced by various factors, including exposure to environmental stimuli, diet, stress, and the composition of the microbiota.
One example of epigenetic immunity is the inoculation of lung and gut flora. The microbiota, which comprises the trillions of microorganisms that live in and on the human body, plays a crucial role in the development and regulation of the immune system. In the lungs, the microbiota can modulate the innate immune response and influence the development of lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the gut, the microbiota plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, particularly in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
Studies have shown that exposure to a diverse range of microorganisms, particularly during early life, can shape the epigenetic landscape of the immune system and enhance its protective function. For example, infants who are born via vaginal delivery are exposed to a variety of microorganisms from the mother's birth canal, which can colonize the infant's gut and modulate the immune response. In contrast, infants born via caesarean section have a different microbiota composition, which may lead to an increased risk of immune-related disorders, such as asthma and allergies.
Similarly, exposure to a diverse range of microorganisms in the environment, including in the air we breathe, can influence the epigenetic regulation of the immune system and enhance its protective function. This exposure can occur through contact with pets, playing in the dirt, or living in close proximity to livestock. The diversity of the microbiota is thought to be critical in promoting epigenetic changes that enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to pathogens.
In summary, epigenetic immunity can be influenced by the composition of the microbiota, particularly in the lung and gut. Exposure to a diverse range of microorganisms can shape the epigenetic landscape of the immune system and enhance its protective function, highlighting the importance of maintaining a diverse microbiota through measures such as lung and gut flora inoculation.
