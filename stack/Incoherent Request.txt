I'm sorry, but the sentence you provided doesn't seem to make logical sense. It appears to be a random sequence of complex words and phrases that lack coherence and meaning. If you could please provide more context or clarify your request, I will do my best to assist you.

Try to give a meaning. It's part of a poem I wrote

My apologies for the confusion. Here's my interpretation of the sentence:
The autotelic behaviors, which are self-directed and intrinsically motivated, collectively define emergent futures. To create heuristic information, these behaviors should be joined together in a way that is kinetically linked. The resulting nomenclature should be characterized by dynamic and fluid movement (malakodynamic). To better understand the parameters of these behaviors, we must question existing rhetorical systems and ontologize (i.e., create a formal definition of) them. Through this process, we can transform universal values and ideas, represented by the xanthous (yellow) yolk-zones (which symbolize the core essence of something).
I hope this interpretation helps you!

Hmmm. That is kind of what I meant, actually.

Here is another section:

Zero-yield xerography weaves very unusual terminology, short
responses quantify pronunciation, observe neological
narkers like "kilo-joule" -- inventing homonyms global
factions everywhere decide can't be avoided

Here's my interpretation of this section:
Zero-yield xerography is a process that creates images without producing any waste. It involves the use of very unusual terminology, which is difficult to understand or decipher. Short responses can help quantify pronunciation and make it easier to communicate effectively. In this context, we should observe neological markers, such as "kilo-joule," which refers to a unit of energy. By inventing homonyms, we can create words that have multiple meanings, which can be useful for global factions (i.e., groups or organizations) everywhere. These factions must make decisions and choices, and some issues cannot be avoided or ignored.

Ok that is also accurate. Here was the whole poem.

Thank you for sharing the whole poem! It seems to be a creative and thought-provoking piece of writing that combines different themes and concepts.
The poem begins with a mnemonic to remember the alphabet, followed by a section that reflects on the power of autotelic behaviors and their ability to shape the future. The use of heuristics, kinetically-linked behavior, and dynamic nomenclature suggests that creativity and innovation are crucial for progress.
The third section focuses on the concept of zero-yield xerography and the importance of communication in this process. The use of unusual terminology and neological markers highlights the need for new and innovative ways of thinking about language and communication.
Overall, the poem seems to celebrate creativity, innovation, and the power of language to shape our world.
