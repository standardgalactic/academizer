A few weeks ago, Amiran Jeranashvili followed his cows across this ravine near his village
and discovered he'd stumbled into Russian-controlled territory.
The animals don't know where the boundaries are, do they?
This is the place where you were detained?
Jeranashvili was detained in a region that's known as South Ossetia, a breakaway state
that Russia considers an independent republic, and Georgia calls occupied territory.
In 2008, the two nations fought a brutal five-day war over this area that ended with
a stalemate.
But in the last several years, Russia's begun building the trappings of a formal state,
installing barbed wire fences and military outposts along what it considers the border.
And Georgian officials have been bringing reporters here to show that the situation has
only gotten worse.
Does it make you angry that people are getting detained while they're trying to do their jobs?
For Georgian officials, Russia's actions are making the case for something they've been
after for more than a decade, membership in NATO.
I think NATO and Euro-Atlantic integration is one of top foreign policy priorities for
Georgia.
David Zakaliani is Georgia's newly appointed foreign minister.
Do you think it's really realistic, though?
I mean, it has been 10 years.
Yes, it has been 10 years, but we are implementing successfully all reforms in the military and
defense sector.
We are the biggest per capita contributor to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan,
and we are fighting together with the United States, together with other NATO allies.
I mean, Georgia deserves to be finally accepted to the NATO full-fledged member, and it's
the only political barrier towards the final membership.
It's been a frustrating campaign for Georgia.
In 2008, NATO promised Georgia it would be offered a formal path to membership, but the
invitation has never come, held up by members who don't want to invite an open conflict
with Russia.
And that's raised a question that Georgian politicians are reluctant to engage with,
at least in public.
So, for example, are you carrying on as if NATO might not happen?
I think that we have to do our job, what we are doing right now, and to wait for the momentum,
and I believe that this moment will come.
That's the right thing to say, but you know, it has been, I mean, it must be a frustrating
time.
I believe that despite all these difficulties, we have to demonstrate strategic patience,
and we have to continue all these reforms.
Gia Nodia is a former minister of education and one of the few people in Tbilisi to openly
acknowledge how little has changed in 10 years.
Georgia has been talking about NATO membership for a long time now.
Right.
Is it happening?
Okay, it's not happening, but we have what we have.
We have a promise that we will become members of NATO eventually, and this promise is reiterated
on every NATO summit.
I mean, the Georgian policy community understands that membership of NATO is somehow, somewhere
far in the horizon.
But they don't say it.
They don't say it in public, of course.
Why not?
Yeah, because it's unpopular, because it plays into the hands of Russian propaganda,
because Russians say that all the West does not care about you.
Pro-Russian parties have been making inroads in recent elections, and although three quarters
of the country still supports joining NATO, Nodia says relying on empty promises has left
Georgia exposed.
Or with Russia showed that the West supports us to some extent, but not really strongly.
So we cannot fully rely on that.
There is no plan B in the sense of joining some other security organization, but the
plan B is really having very good relations with all our neighbors.
If Georgia joined NATO, do you think that would help this situation?
Nothing seems to scare the Russians right now.
Would you fight again?
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

Yeah.
