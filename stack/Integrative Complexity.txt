The misunderstood limits of folk science: 
an illusion of explanatory depth 
Leonid Rozenblit���, Frank Keil
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The article "The Misunderstood Limits of Folk Science: An Illusion of Explanatory Depth" by Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil has sparked interest and discussions in various fields. The core idea of the article is that people often feel they understand complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth than they really do, leading to what is termed as an "illusion of explanatory depth." This illusion is particularly strong for explanatory knowledge compared to other types of knowledge, such as facts, procedures, or narratives. The authors demonstrate this through a series of studies, showing that people are often overconfident about their understanding of various knowledge domains.
The implications of this work extend to areas like explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), where understanding human explanatory reasoning is crucial for developing user-centered AI systems. The article's insights are used to highlight key tendencies in how people construct and infer from explanations, which can inform the provision of automated explanations in AI systems.
Moreover, the concept of the illusion of explanatory depth is important for understanding various aspects of human cognition and society. It shows how change blindness, the illusion of levels, and the rarity of detailed explanations contribute to our overestimation of our own understanding. For instance, our ability to describe different levels of an item or concept can inflate our perception of our knowledge, even if we can't explain how these parts function together. This phenomenon has broader implications for how knowledge and understanding are perceived and conveyed in society, underlining a common gap between perceived and actual understanding���

What's the illusion of levels?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The "illusion of levels" is a concept related to the illusion of explanatory depth, which was discussed in the context of Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil's research. It refers to the cognitive bias where people overestimate their understanding of a complex system due to their ability to describe it at different levels of abstraction or detail.
Here's how the illusion of levels typically works:
Superficial Understanding
: People might be able to describe the basic components or superficial aspects of a concept or an object. For example, in explaining how a computer works, one might list its parts like a screen, keyboard, mouse, and motherboard.
Perceived Depth
: Being able to describe these different levels (from components to functions) gives an inflated perception of understanding. People often think that because they can describe what these parts are or what they do superficially, they understand the deeper workings of the entire system.
Lack of True Depth
: However, this perceived understanding is often shallow. In the computer example, even if someone can describe what a keyboard does, they might not understand how these parts work together to make the computer function. Their knowledge of deeper operational principles or the integration of components is often limited.
Overestimation of Knowledge
: As a result of this illusion, individuals often overestimate their knowledge and understanding of complex systems. This overconfidence can be problematic, particularly in decision-making or when explaining concepts to others.
The illusion of levels highlights a common cognitive pitfall: mistaking the ability to recognize or describe superficial aspects of a system for a deeper understanding of how it actually works. This concept is essential in various fields, including education, communication, and technology, where accurate understanding and communication of complex systems are crucial���

Do you know the book Physics Avoidance by Mark Wilson?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Physics Avoidance: and other Essays in Conceptual Strategy" by Mark Wilson presents a collection of explorations into our strategies for understanding the world. The book delves into the complexities of scientific reasoning and highlights the challenges in reasoning about nature in a straightforward manner. Instead, it suggests that we often need to adopt alternative policies to address our questions in a tractable way.
One of the key themes in Wilson's work is the critique of the simplifications often made in scientific theorizing, which he refers to as "physics avoidance." He argues that the real-world phenomena are often too complex to be captured by overly simplified models or theories. For instance, Wilson discusses the limitations of reducing thermodynamic concepts to purely mechanical ones and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the distinct and complex nature of various scientific concepts and phenomena.
Wilson's essays also touch upon the idea of 'explanatory architectures' - distinctive patterns of reasoning suited to different scales and types of information in nature. He argues that these architectures are necessary due to the diversity and complexity of the natural world, and that they often resist the simplicity sought in unified scientific theories.
Additionally, the book explores the relationship between language and science. Wilson argues against the notion of simple, global referential meanings in language, suggesting instead that language-world alignments are complex, indirect, and context-dependent. This perspective challenges some traditional views in philosophical semantics and underscores the adaptability and evolution of language in response to new scientific discoveries and conceptual challenges.
Overall, "Physics Avoidance" presents a nuanced view of scientific modeling and reasoning, emphasizing the need for a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between language, science, and the complexities of the natural world���

I think he has a similar thesis, that physics and the hard sciences use simple well defined problems in highly constrained domains. I understand the point of the first article was that humans feel they understand a complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth than they really do, but think that the complexity of training machines to walk, identify objects, and learn language was way more difficult then anyone anticipated, indicating that humans do a lot of things that they can not clearly articulate, abstraction and encapsulation indicates that you do not need to know how a system functions internally in order to know how it behaves (and it can have different implementations, hidden from the observer) naive physics indicates even uneducated or preliterate people embody a huge amount of knowledge, polycomputation indicates that all sorts of calculation can occur at multiple levels such as glucose and oxygen levels, but  which might not be easily articulated.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You've touched upon several intriguing concepts that bridge cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of science, resonating with the themes in Mark Wilson's "Physics Avoidance" and the study by Rozenblit and Keil.
Complexity in Hard Sciences
: Wilson's thesis suggests that the hard sciences often use simplified, well-defined problems in highly constrained domains. This can lead to a form of "physics avoidance," where the complexities of real-world phenomena are not fully captured by scientific models. This aligns with the observation that tasks like training machines to walk, identify objects, and learn language are more complex than anticipated, highlighting the gap between our theoretical understanding and the intricacies of real-world applications.
Human Understanding vs. Articulation
: The study by Rozenblit and Keil emphasizes that humans often believe they understand complex phenomena more deeply than they actually do. This overestimation of understanding is contrasted by the fact that humans effortlessly perform complex tasks (like walking or language acquisition) without being able to fully articulate how they do it. This gap between understanding and articulation is a key area of interest in both cognitive science and AI.
Abstraction and Encapsulation
: These concepts, from computer science, suggest that knowing how a system behaves doesn���t necessarily require understanding its internal workings. This principle is often true in human cognition as well, where people can use tools or concepts effectively without fully understanding their underlying mechanisms.
Na��ve Physics and Embodied Knowledge
: Even without formal education, people have an intuitive grasp of basic physical principles, indicating a vast reservoir of implicit or embodied knowledge. This concept challenges the notion that explicit, articulated knowledge is the only form of true understanding.
Polycomputation and Multi-Level Processing
: The idea of polycomputation reflects how complex biological processes, like maintaining glucose or oxygen levels, involve computations at multiple levels, often simultaneously and without conscious awareness. This ties into the broader theme that much of human cognitive processing and understanding occurs below the level of conscious articulation.
These concepts collectively suggest a more nuanced view of knowledge and understanding, one that acknowledges the complexity and multi-layered nature of both human cognition and scientific modeling. They also highlight the challenges faced in AI and robotics in replicating human-like understanding and abilities, underscoring the intricacies of natural intelligence and the limitations of current scientific models.

Do you know the book, the mind is flat?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The Mind is Flat: The Illusion of Mental Depth and The Improvised Mind" by Nick Chater presents a radical reinterpretation of the workings of the mind. Chater, a prominent behavioural scientist, argues against the traditional view that our minds possess hidden depths of beliefs, motives, and desires. Instead, he suggests that the idea of an unconscious mind is a myth and that we generate our ideas, motives, and thoughts in the moment.
Chater's thesis is that all types of thought are essentially extensions of perception. He challenges the notion of unconscious thinking, proposing that consciousness must be sensory experience since the areas identified as the locations of conscious experience are sensory relay stations. This leads him to conclude that non-sensory thoughts do not exist and that language and numerical concepts are fundamentally sensory in nature.
The book also delves into the idea of interpretation as a key concept in our thought processes. Chater discusses the role of attention and consciousness in this context, suggesting a close relationship between these elements. He posits that attention is crucial for interpretation and understanding, and that conscious experience is the result of the interpretation of sensory information.
Chater's work challenges many established notions in psychology and neuroscience, including the belief in the existence of an unconscious mind populated with hidden motives and intentions. His perspective suggests that much of what we understand about human psychology and the workings of the mind could be reconsidered without these traditional assumptions.
This book provides a thought-provoking perspective on human cognition, challenging long-held beliefs and offering new insights into how we understand and interpret our experiences.

I think that this reminds me of the mimetic hypothesis of embodied musical listening with endogenous proxy muscle oscillations and mapping onto arbitrary directional place maps so that emotions and music are given an up down or mapped to tension and release even if it is not a physical aspect of the sensory medium
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept you're describing relates to the idea that our understanding and experience of music and emotions are deeply connected to our bodily sensations and movements, even in the absence of explicit physical activity. This ties in with several theories in cognitive science and neuroscience:
Mimetic Hypothesis
: This hypothesis suggests that our understanding or experience of music (and possibly other stimuli) involves mimicking or simulating the actions or emotions expressed in the music. Essentially, when we listen to music, our brains might generate internal representations that mimic the physical expressions or emotions conveyed in the music.
Embodied Musical Listening
: This concept extends the mimetic hypothesis to suggest that our experience of music is grounded in our body's movements and sensations. When we listen to music, our bodies might engage in subtle, often unconscious, movements or muscle oscillations that reflect the rhythm, tempo, and emotional content of the music.
Endogenous Proxy Muscle Oscillations
: This could refer to the internal (endogenous) muscle responses that occur in response to music. These are not overt movements but rather subtle internal changes in muscle tension or neural activity related to muscles, which might correspond to the rhythm or emotional tone of the music.
Directional Place Maps and Emotional Mapping
: This idea suggests that we may internally map emotions and musical elements onto spatial dimensions or directions (like up/down or tension/release). For example, an increase in musical tension might be internally represented as an upward movement or increase in spatial height, while release or resolution in music might be felt as a downward movement or decrease. This spatial mapping could be a way for the brain to organize and interpret complex emotional and sensory information.
These concepts highlight the interplay between our sensory experiences, bodily states, and cognitive processes. They suggest that our understanding and enjoyment of music are not just auditory experiences but involve a complex integration of sensory, motor, and emotional responses. This perspective aligns with broader theories in embodied cognition, which propose that our cognitive processes are deeply rooted in our body's interactions with the environment.

Do you know the book, Context changes everything?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence" is a book by Alicia Juarrero that offers a novel perspective on causation and the nature of coherence in the natural world. Juarrero challenges the traditional belief that only direct, forceful impacts can be considered causes, proposing instead that constraints play a crucial role in bringing about effects and enabling coherence.
The book explores how enabling constraints induce coherence, which is then maintained by constitutive constraints. These, in turn, become governing constraints that regulate and modulate the behavior of coherent entities. This approach uses the tools of complexity science to offer a scientific understanding of concepts like identity, hierarchy, and top-down causation.
Juarrero's work has significant implications across various fields including sociology, economics, political theory, business, and knowledge management, as well as psychology, religion, and theology. She posits that personal identity, traditionally thought to be conferred through internal traits or essential natures, is actually grounded in dynamic interdependencies that maintain the integrity of coherent structures.
This book presents a new way of thinking about the natural world, emphasizing the importance of context and the dynamic interplay of various elements in shaping identities and coherent structures. Juarrero's framework suggests that stability does not equate to inflexible rigidity; rather, it is the dynamic interplay of constraints that enables entities to be robust and resilient.
"Context Changes Everything" offers a fresh perspective on understanding the complexities of the natural world, challenging conventional ideas of identity and causation. It points to a more expansive and synthetic philosophy regarding the coherence of both living and nonliving things.

Hayden constructed complex internal narratives concerning the children's theory of minds and assumed their intentions from their actions and assumed that negative behavior were attempts at experimentation with finding limits or constraints of the environment.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Torey Hayden's work, particularly in her books detailing her experiences as a special education teacher, indeed reflects a deep engagement with the internal worlds of the children she worked with. Hayden's narratives often suggest that she interprets the behaviors and actions of these children as more than just surface-level reactions. She seems to view them as expressions of their attempts to understand and test the limits of their environment.
Hayden's approach appears to consider the children's behaviors as experiments in finding constraints or limits, suggesting a perspective that aligns with exploring their theory of mind. This involves attributing intentions, desires, and beliefs to the children based on their actions. By understanding their behaviors as attempts to interact with and make sense of their world, Hayden's narratives provide a compassionate and empathetic view of children facing emotional and behavioral challenges.
Such an approach is crucial in special education and therapeutic settings, where understanding the underlying reasons for a child's behavior can inform more effective strategies for support and intervention.

I was specifically arguing against the thesis of "the misunderstood limits of folk science" and that the researchers and experimental methods overlay a gross simplification process in order to reduce explanations to 26 letters and x parameters.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your argument against the thesis of "The Misunderstood Limits of Folk Science" by Rozenblit and Keil seems to stem from a concern about the oversimplification inherent in scientific research methods. This is a valid point in the broader debate about the nature of scientific inquiry and the representation of complex phenomena.
Reductionism in Scientific Research
: In many scientific studies, including those in psychology, complex phenomena are often reduced to simpler, more manageable components. This reductionism can sometimes lead to oversimplifications that might not fully capture the intricacies of the phenomena being studied. The process of translating complex behaviors or cognitive processes into quantifiable data (like using 26 letters and specific parameters) can indeed miss out on the nuances of the subject matter.
Complexity of Human Behavior
: Human behavior and cognition are incredibly complex and are influenced by a myriad of factors. Simplifying these into controlled experimental conditions can sometimes lead to conclusions that might not be entirely reflective of real-world scenarios. This is a common critique in psychological research.
Interpretation and Context
: The interpretation of data in psychological studies can be influenced by the researchers' perspectives and the context in which the research is conducted. This means that different researchers might draw different conclusions from the same set of data, especially in a field as subjective as psychology.
Counterpoint - Rigor and Replicability in Research
: On the other hand, the simplification of complex phenomena into measurable components is a necessary part of scientific research. It allows for the rigor and replicability that are hallmarks of scientific inquiry. Without this process, it would be challenging to systematically study and understand the patterns and principles underlying human behavior and cognition.
Hayden's Approach
: In contrast to the controlled conditions of laboratory research, Torey Hayden's work, for instance, is grounded in real-world educational settings. Her observations and interventions are based on direct, complex interactions with children, which provides a different perspective on human behavior and cognition. However, this type of work, while rich in detail and context, might lack the systematic analysis and generalizability of more controlled scientific studies.
In summary, your argument touches upon a central tension in psychological and behavioral science: the need to balance the depth and complexity of human behavior with the scientific necessity for simplification and measurability. Both approaches, the experimental and the experiential (as in Hayden's work), offer valuable insights, but they also come with their respective limitations and strengths.

I wanted to argue that some young children might be able to pilot airplanes or run governments, because these tasks have simplified "API"s for interacting with them so that they are not so difficult as they appear, but have automated aspects and built in failsafes.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your argument presents an intriguing perspective, proposing that certain complex tasks, such as piloting airplanes or running governments, might be accessible to young children due to the presence of simplified interfaces ("APIs"), automation, and built-in fail-safes. Here are some considerations and challenges related to this idea:
Simplified Interfaces and Automation
: Modern technology has indeed simplified the interaction with complex systems. For instance, aircraft are equipped with advanced autopilot systems, and governments have bureaucratic structures and protocols that streamline decision-making. These systems can reduce the need for constant, active human control or complex decision-making.
Cognitive and Emotional Maturity
: Despite technological simplifications, tasks like flying an airplane or governing require not only technical skill but also cognitive and emotional maturity. Young children are still developing critical thinking, problem-solving skills, emotional regulation, and the ability to understand long-term consequences, all of which are crucial in high-stakes environments.
Learning and Adaptability of Children
: Children, as Alison Gopnik's research suggests, are incredibly adaptable and learn rapidly. They can understand and interact with their environment in sophisticated ways. However, this adaptability and learning capability are typically directed towards fundamental developmental milestones rather than specialized skills such as piloting or governance.
Safety and Ethical Considerations
: Even if children could theoretically operate complex systems due to simplified interfaces, safety and ethical considerations are paramount. The responsibility involved in flying planes or making governmental decisions carries risks that would be unethical and unsafe to place on a child.
The Role of Education and Training
: Proficiency in complex tasks like piloting or governance usually requires extensive education and training, which provide not only technical knowledge but also contextual understanding, risk assessment capabilities, and ethical guidelines.
The Gap Between Potential and Prudence
: While children might have the potential to learn and interact with simplified systems, it is prudent to consider their overall development, welfare, and the societal implications of placing them in roles typically reserved for adults with years of training and experience.
In summary, while technological advancements have simplified the operation of complex systems to some extent, the successful and responsible execution of high-stakes tasks like piloting airplanes or running governments involves a combination of technical skills, cognitive and emotional maturity, and extensive training, which are beyond the current developmental capabilities of young children. The idea does, however, highlight the impressive adaptability and learning potential of children, a theme central to developmental psychology.

Ok it was like a 4 million dollar plane, she was 6 years old:

In this inspirational footage, the girl is told by her dad to "go ahead and disconnect the autopilot" as soon as he confirms that the runway is in sight. She listens and takes control of the jet by placing both hands on the yoke while the adult keeps his hands on the throttle and feet on the pedals. Although not visible in the video, it's also possible that he held his left hand hovering near the jet's "steering wheel."

Nearly perfect
She kept the aircraft lined up with the runway and, albeit a tad bit nervous, listened to her dad's instructions. And, just like that, landed the jet in what can only be considered an almost butter landing. "At least we didn't crash," wittingly said the girl after making safe contact with the tarmac.
The girl is already used to aviation lingo and has nearly mastered talking with air traffic control (ATC). She can be heard saying "Taxi to parking, Zero, Golf, Yankee" to the air traffic controller.

The story you're referring to is indeed remarkable. It describes a 6-year-old girl landing a jet plane, a task that typically requires extensive training and experience. In the video, the girl takes control of the aircraft under her father's guidance, who remains in charge of the throttle and pedals. Her successful landing, described as nearly perfect, showcases not only her courage but also her familiarity with aviation procedures, including communication with air traffic control.
This event highlights how certain tasks, perceived as highly complex, can be simplified through technology like autopilot systems, and in specific circumstances, can be managed by individuals without traditional qualifications, in this case, a young child. However, it's important to note that such a scenario is exceptional and doesn't necessarily overturn the fundamental requirements of skill, experience, and maturity usually needed for piloting aircraft.

Ok can you see why I mentioned it?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, I can see why you mentioned the story about the 6-year-old girl landing a jet plane. It serves as a striking example that supports your argument against the thesis of "The Misunderstood Limits of Folk Science." This real-world instance demonstrates that complex tasks, often thought to require extensive knowledge and experience, can be simplified and potentially managed by individuals without formal training or expertise, in this case, a very young child. It challenges the assumption that our understanding of complex systems, like piloting an aircraft, is as limited as researchers like Rozenblit and Keil suggest. This story illustrates that with the right tools, support, and simplified interfaces, even seemingly intricate tasks can be made accessible, thus offering a counterpoint to the idea of an inherent limitation in human understanding of complex phenomena.

The Mind is Flat (Nick Chater)
: We talked about Chater's theory that the mind improvises thoughts and beliefs, challenging traditional notions of a deep, subconscious mind.
Mimetic Hypothesis and Embodied Musical Listening
: This concept relates to how people understand music and emotions through bodily sensations and movements.
Work of Torey Hayden and Alison Gopnik
: We examined Hayden's practical approach to teaching children with emotional and behavioral disorders and Gopnik's research on how children think and learn.
Simplification of Complex Tasks
: We discussed the idea that complex tasks, such as piloting airplanes or running governments, might be simplified through technology, allowing even young children to perform them, as exemplified by a story of a young girl landing a jet plane.
Throughout, we explored how these various perspectives contribute to our understanding of human cognition, behavior, and learning.

I wanted to mention that perceived child geniuses might people who were kept from real danger, and who competed in simplified "arenas" where actually difficult problems were excluded.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation about perceived child geniuses is an interesting perspective. It suggests that the environments in which these children demonstrate their abilities are often controlled and free from real danger, thereby creating a "safe" space for showcasing their skills. The complexity and unpredictability of real-world problems are often not present in these simplified arenas. This controlled environment allows them to excel in specific areas without facing the full breadth of challenges that typically accompany complex tasks in uncontrolled, real-life situations. This perspective adds an important dimension to understanding the nature of exceptional abilities in children and the contexts in which they are nurtured and displayed.

The point that the plain can land itself should make the child look less intelligent, but this fact is conveniently ignored
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're highlighting an important aspect of how we perceive and evaluate intelligence, especially in extraordinary cases like a child landing a plane. The fact that modern planes are equipped with advanced technologies, such as autopilot systems, which can significantly aid in landing, is often overlooked in sensational stories. This oversight can lead to an inflated perception of the individual's abilities. In reality, the task might not require the level of skill or intelligence that is presumed if the technology is doing most of the work. Recognizing the role of these technological aids is crucial in accurately assessing such feats and understanding the true nature of the skill involved.

Integrative complexity is a research psychometric that refers to the degree to which thinking and reasoning involve the recognition and integration of multiple perspectives and possibilities and their interrelated contingencies.

Integrative complexity is a measure of the intellectual style used by individuals or groups in processing information, problem-solving, and decision making. Complexity looks at the structure of one's thoughts, while ignoring the contents. It is scorable from almost any verbal materials: written materials, such as books, articles, letters, and transcript; as well as audio-visual material.

The measure of integrative complexity has two components: differentiation and integration. Differentiation refers to the perception of different dimensions when considering an issue. Integration refers to the recognition of cognitive connections among differentiated dimensions or perspectives.
