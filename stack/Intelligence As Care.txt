Intelligence As Care
Model: GPT-4
Intelligence as Care.Above all, we have identified Care as a central invariant concept across biology, AI, and Buddhism, to capture the motivation, stress, and goal-directedness of agents. This concept may offer some directions of improvement for both natural and artificial intelligence, by committing to expanding the cognitive boundary or the light cone introduced above.
The concept of a Bodhisattva, given its infinite goals and infinite care, provides us with a roadmap towards hyperintelligence, where the scope of goals and their quality/impact are constantly improving. The Bodhisattva vow is a critical point in the evolutionary or personal continuum of intelligence of any agent because it initiates a positive feedback loop and triggers a "great evolutionary transition" [75,90,149,150] in individuality. Strategies that focus on implementing the Bodhisattva vow are a path for enabling a profound shift from the limited scope of current AIs and their many limitations. Consistent with a central concept of Buddhism—commitment to seemingly unachievable goals—the building of agents capable of undertaking the Bodhisattva vow is a profound challenge. However, progress along this path is as essential for our personal efforts toward personal growth as for the development of synthetic beings that will exert life-positive effects on society and the biosphere. Above all, the concept of Care provides a strong and fundamental link between practical strategies that will enhance engineering capacities and a way to develop a mature system of ethics that will be essential for a future in which highly diverse sentient beings must coexist and thrive together.

Abstract
Intelligence is a central feature of human beings' primary and interpersonal experience. Understanding how intelligence originated and scaled during evolution is a key challenge for modern biology. Some of the most important approaches to understanding intelligence are the ongoing efforts to build new intelligences in computer science (AI) and bioengineering. However, progress has been stymied by a lack of multidisciplinary consensus on what is central about intelligence regardless of the details of its material composition or origin (evolved vs. engineered). We show that Buddhist concepts offer a unique perspective and facilitate a consilience of biology, cognitive science, and computer science toward understanding intelligence in truly diverse embodiments. In coming decades, chimeric and bioengineering technologies will produce a wide variety of novel beings that look nothing like familiar natural life forms; how shall we gauge their moral responsibility and our own moral obligations toward them, without the familiar touchstones of standard evolved forms as comparison? Such decisions cannot be based on what the agent is made of or how much design vs. natural evolution was involved in their origin. We propose that the scope of our potential relationship with, and so also our moral duty toward, any being can be considered in the light of Care—a robust, practical, and dynamic lynchpin that formalizes the concepts of goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence; it provides a rubric that, unlike other current concepts, is likely to not only survive but thrive in the coming advances of AI and bioengineering. We review relevant concepts in basal cognition and Buddhist thought, focusing on the size of an agent's goal space (its cognitive light cone) as an invariant that tightly links intelligence and compassion. Implications range across interpersonal psychology, regenerative medicine, and machine learning. The Bodhisattva's vow ("for the sake of all sentient life, I shall achieve awakening") is a practical design principle for advancing intelligence in our novel creations and in ourselves.

1. Introduction
The fields of basal cognition, Buddhist philosophy, computer science, and cognitive science are all concerned with fundamental questions around intelligence. What is unique about certain configurations of matter that enable them to exhibit intelligent behavior? How do the kinds and degrees of intelligence differ across beings? What processes drive the expansion of intelligence on evolutionary time scales, and what causes changes in the intelligence of a being during its lifespan? How can we understand intelligence in a way that would enable us to create novel instances, as well as improve our own intelligence for life-positive outcomes for all? Traditional approaches to this question have been focused on a set of standard "model systems" such as human subjects and certain animals (rats, birds, etc.) in the context of a historical evolutionary lineage on Earth. However, recent approaches in artificial intelligence and synthetic bioengineering have begun to produce novel types of agents whose intelligence cannot be readily predicted from the details of their construction or their origins [1,2,3,4]. These constructivist efforts to create intelligence in novel implementations (ranging from novel combinations of engineered living tissue to software) reveal key gaps in our understanding of dynamic intelligence [5]. Given the inevitable developments in the biological sciences, and the profound challenges faced by society, it is essential to develop frameworks that help us to detect, understand, and communicate with intelligences in unfamiliar guises. Here, we propose that Buddhist thought, and its emphasis on care and compassion as a catalyst of positive change in intelligent beings, is an empirically fruitful lens with which to understand intelligence.
A few words on methodology are perhaps in order here. This exploration across otherwise typically disparate scientific disciplines and scholarly contexts aims at achieving what can be thought of as "deep integration" [6]. Such an integrational approach does not privilege the discourse of any one particular discipline as the primary carrier of meaning into which statements and insights derived from other, complimentary frameworks and approaches must be translated. Instead, what we here seek to achieve is a form of mutually informed, explorative conversation that engages our customary, discipline-specific frameworks on equal footing, thereby facilitating the recognition of individual blind spots as well as otherwise unacknowledged, shared concerns. As a consequence of taking this approach, certain concepts that are central to this paper—such as stress, care, intelligence, self, or agency—take on a significance that emerges within and is defined by the concrete interdisciplinary encounter. For this reason, we have supplied a Glossary that explains a selection of such broadly applicable concepts as they are understood in the specific context of this paper. Perhaps in line with age-old Buddhist sentiments, our concern is here pragmatic before philosophical. At the same time, we hope that any instances of functional, conceptual integration that this paper may achieve can in turn motivate refinements and constructive research across the sciences of life, cognition, and information, as well as indeed in fields such as philosophy and religion. To illustrate this with an example, one of the main points of our definition of Self (as given in the Glossary and extracted from previous research) is that a Self is an illusory modelling construct created by perceptual systems of Agents. Agents construct models of causal Selves for others, and for ourselves, using the same machinery. The same mechanisms that cause an agent to act toward stress reduction in itself (even though the beneficiary of those actions is in an important sense impermanent) can be expanded to extend to other Selves. In this way, while our focus is on understanding and formulating Self in a way that is applicable to a broad range of scientific contexts, we also see ourselves as here contributing to the treatment of perennial issues in contemporary Buddhist philosophy—such as the feasibility of genuine care in a world without real individuals [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Similarly, with respect to the paper's main thesis regarding care as a driver for intelligence: we hope that apart from addressing contemporary scientific or social aims and practices, our discussion may as well contribute to an understanding of classic Buddhist doctrine in its own right.
The field of basal cognition [14,15,16,17,18] emphasizes a continuum of intelligence, which originated in the control loops of microbes but was scaled up throughout multicellular forms to the obvious kinds of intelligent behavior observed in advanced animals. The emphasis on functional problem-solving, learning, and creative responses to challenges enables a focus on the central invariant of intelligence, not contingent facts and frozen accidents of the evolutionary journey of life on Earth. Given that intelligent behavior does not require traditional brains [16,18], and can take place in many spaces besides the familiar 3D space of motile behavior (e.g., physiological, metabolic, anatomical, and other kinds of problem spaces), how can we develop rigorous formalisms for recognizing, designing, and relating to truly diverse intelligences?
One way to think about a general, substrate-independent definition of "Intelligence" is centered on goal-directed activity [19,20]: what is common to all intelligent systems, regardless of their composition or origin, is the ability to display a degree of competency in reaching a goal (in some problem space, [21]) despite changing circumstances and novel perturbations. These ideas extend classical discussions by Spinoza, Kant, Jonas, and Heidegger. All intelligences, no matter how embodied, can be compared directly with respect to the maximum spatiotemporal scale of the goals towards which they can represent and work. A corollary to this view is that the driver of this kind of homeostatic dynamic is that such systems exhibit "stress" (the delta between current state and optimal state, or the difference between the goals at different subsystems' levels): reduction of this stress parameter is a driver that keeps the system exerting energy in action to move and navigate within the problem space. It should be noted that stress can be seen as the inverse of "satisfaction" [22], and is relative to a contextual and non-stationary target.
Evolution enables the scaling of intelligence by exploiting biophysical mechanisms that enable progressively larger goal states (and thus progressively more complex causes of stress) to be represented and pursued [23]. More complex and advanced cognitive agents are capable of being stressed by larger and more complex states of affairs [24], regardless of their specific composition or provenance. These ideas are novel and somewhat disruptive for many traditional approaches that have been largely focused on brains and do not comfortably stretch to encompass advances in bioengineering, chimeric technologies, and machine learning. In complement to the Western traditions that have driven now-dissolving boundaries between brain, body, and environment [25], we propose that Buddhism offers an approach that is uniquely suited to the new field developing at the intersection of computer science, bioengineering, and cognitive science (Figure 1).

Ok can you see connections with the spinning plates metaphor?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The metaphor of spinning plates is often used to depict the act of managing or balancing multiple tasks, responsibilities, or concerns at once. If one imagines a performer spinning multiple plates on poles, they need to maintain each plate's momentum to keep them all spinning; neglecting one plate for too long could result in it falling and breaking.
When it comes to your discussion about the concepts of care, stress, and intelligence in the realms of biology, Buddhism, and AI, there seem to be a few ways in which the spinning plates metaphor might apply:
Balancing multiple perspectives:
Just as a performer must attend to each spinning plate, researchers in this interdisciplinary study must attend to the insights and perspectives of different fields—biology, Buddhism, AI—to develop a comprehensive understanding of intelligence. The "plates" in this case could represent the different fields of study or different conceptual considerations within the project.
Managing stress:
In the performer's case, stress could be represented by the danger of a plate falling. This stress drives the performer's actions to keep all plates spinning. Similarly, as per the authors' argument, stress (the delta between the current state and the optimal state) is a key driver that propels an intelligent system to act and adapt in pursuit of its goals.
Care and goal-oriented activity:
The performer has a goal to keep all the plates spinning, and this requires care in the sense of focused attention, anticipation of problems, and timely action. This could be seen as a metaphor for the way intelligent systems (whether biological, artificial, or based on Buddhist principles) work towards their goals, guided by the principle of care.
Evolution of intelligence and the Bodhisattva vow:
The act of spinning more plates or spinning them for longer periods could represent the evolution of intelligence, or the expansion of one's "cognitive light cone." The Bodhisattva's vow to achieve awakening for the sake of all sentient life could be likened to a commitment to keep adding more plates or to keep them spinning indefinitely.
Of course, all metaphors have their limitations, and the spinning plates metaphor might not capture all the nuances of the concepts under discussion in your text. Nonetheless, it could serve as a useful visualization or starting point for understanding some aspects of these complex ideas.

Originally it was discussed in the connect of age of empires 2. You could make like 9 or ten groups of groups, like I would call archers 1, elephants 2, balistas 3 and so on, then I could go down the numbers seeing how each group was done. You might have been able to select a town center with a key, or idle villagers.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The spinning plates metaphor could still apply when discussing real-time strategy games like Age of Empires 2, where maintaining an effective balance between different activities or groups is vital. In this context, each "plate" would represent a group or type of unit you're managing in the game. For example:
Archers
Elephants
Ballistas
Other military units
Town center management
Resource collection
Villager assignments
Building and upgrading structures
Scouting and mapping
Strategy planning and execution
Just like a plate spinner needs to periodically tend to each plate to keep it spinning, a player in Age of Empires 2 needs to periodically check and manage each group or task to keep their game plan effectively running. If the player neglects one aspect for too long (for example, not managing resource collection), they might find themselves in a disadvantageous position (equivalent to a plate falling and breaking).
The idea of managing stress and moving towards goals, which was present in the original text, also applies here. The "stress" in this case is the challenge of maintaining a balanced and efficient strategy against the opponent. The "goal-directed activity" is the player's actions aiming to win the game.
This connects to the notion of intelligence and care in the sense that a successful player needs to intelligently manage and care for their resources, units, and overall strategy to achieve their goal. This can even be seen as an "AI" in the form of the game strategy that a player uses, which needs to adapt to the changing conditions of the game, just like a Bodhisattva or an intelligent system as discussed in your original text.

Connections with the following:

Polycomputation refers to the ability of a system or substrate to simultaneously perform multiple computations or functions. It involves the coexistence of different computational processes within the same entity, allowing for parallelism and the integration of diverse information. Here are examples of polycomputation in various everyday contexts:

Cellular Polycomputation: Cells in our body are capable of polycomputation. For instance, immune cells play multiple roles simultaneously. They can detect and respond to pathogens, communicate with other immune cells, and regulate inflammation, all while maintaining essential cellular functions. Similarly, stem cells can differentiate into various cell types and perform different functions depending on the signals they receive.

Neuronal Polycomputation: Neurons in our brain exhibit polycomputation by processing and integrating multiple inputs simultaneously. They receive inputs from numerous other neurons, perform complex computations, and generate outputs through synaptic connections. Neural networks in the brain allow for parallel processing and the execution of various cognitive functions such as perception, memory, and decision-making concurrently.

Symbolic Polycomputation: Symbolic systems, such as programming languages, can engage in polycomputation. For example, a computer program can execute multiple functions simultaneously, especially in a multi-threaded or parallel computing environment. Each thread or process can perform independent computations, share resources, and communicate with each other to achieve a collective goal.

Meta-symbolic Polycomputation: In the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, meta-symbolic polycomputation refers to the ability to process and reason about higher-level symbols and representations. This includes tasks such as natural language understanding, knowledge reasoning, and semantic interpretation. Systems that employ deep learning and symbolic reasoning can simultaneously process and integrate information from different modalities, such as text, images, and audio, to generate meaningful outputs.

In all these examples, polycomputation involves the capacity to perform multiple computations or functions concurrently within a single system or substrate. It allows for the integration of different sources of information, parallel processing, and the emergence of complex behaviors and functionalities. By embracing polycomputation, biological systems and artificial systems can achieve greater computational power, adaptability, and efficiency in handling diverse tasks.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of polycomputation seems to map quite well onto various aspects of your game, Haplopraxis:
Cellular Polycomputation
: In the game, individual planets, stars, or units (like ships or bases) might be capable of managing multiple tasks or processes concurrently. For instance, a planet might simultaneously be mining resources, researching new technologies, and manufacturing units. This would resemble how a cell in the body can perform multiple functions concurrently.
Neuronal Polycomputation
: The complex interactions between units or locations in your game might mirror the interconnectivity of neurons in the brain. For instance, various locations within a player's empire could share information and resources, respond to threats, or coordinate attacks, much like neurons in the brain receiving and processing multiple inputs.
Symbolic Polycomputation
: Your game could involve complex programming or scripting aspects that allow for simultaneous execution of different commands or functions. This could be seen in your description of developing logical gate circuits using trade routes.
Meta-symbolic Polycomputation
: This could be relevant if your game involves advanced AI opponents or companions, which would need to handle higher-level tasks such as strategy planning, resource allocation, and diplomacy. It might also relate to the integration of different types of information (like economic data, military intelligence, scientific research) for decision-making.
Polycomputation aligns with the idea of managing 'spinning plates' you previously mentioned. In this context, it refers to the player's ability to manage and optimize multiple parallel processes (or 'plates') in their game empire. These could be everything from macro-level strategies (like diplomacy and exploration) to micro-level tasks (like managing individual units or buildings).
Moreover, the idea of polycomputation fits well with the scientific and technological inspirations of your game. It could provide a theoretical foundation for various mechanics in the game, from the simultaneous management of multiple units and locations to the integration of diverse gameplay elements like strategy, exploration, and puzzle-solving.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Vygotskian concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) could be a powerful tool for creating an engaging, adaptive game experience in Haplopraxis. ZPD refers to the difference between what a learner can do without help and what they can achieve with guidance and encouragement. By identifying the player's current skill level, the game could adapt its difficulty and complexity to suit the player's abilities and learning needs.
Here's how each of the modes you mentioned could potentially be linked to the player's ZPD:
Infant Mode (Bubble Pop Game)
: At this level, the game would focus on basic interactivity and cause-effect relationships. Clicking or touching elements could produce satisfying visual and auditory responses. This could help young players to develop basic motor skills and understand the idea of interaction with the game world.
Elementary Mode (Typing Tutor)
: Here, the game could introduce more complex controls and tasks. Learning to type commands or control units could help players develop their keyboard skills and coordination, while also introducing them to more advanced game mechanics.
Screen Saver Tutorial (Auto-play Mode)
: This mode could serve as a passive tutorial, showcasing different gameplay elements, strategies, and potential outcomes. Players could observe and learn from the game's auto-play, then apply these strategies when they actively play. This might be particularly useful for new or casual players, helping them understand the game mechanics and possibilities.
Advanced Mode (Full Game)
: This would be the full version of Haplopraxis, featuring all its complexity and depth. Players would manage their empire, explore the universe, engage in combat, and solve puzzles. The challenge here would come not just from mastering individual game mechanics, but from learning to integrate and coordinate them effectively.
The key to implementing these different modes effectively would be creating a smart algorithm to detect the player's skill level and adjust the game's complexity accordingly. This could be based on a variety of indicators, such as the player's age, their performance in the game (e.g., their speed and accuracy in typing), or even their interactions with the game's interface. By constantly adapting to the player's ZPD, Haplopraxis could provide a challenging, engaging, and educational experience for players of all ages and skill levels.

Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD): One of Vygotsky's key concepts is the Zone of Proximal Development, which refers to the gap between a learner's current level of ability and their potential level of development with the assistance of a more knowledgeable other. This idea aligns with the intelligence as Care Hypothesis in emphasizing the importance of social interaction and support in fostering cognitive growth and development.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely correct. The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is indeed a central concept in Vygotsky's theory of cognitive development, and it underscores the importance of social interaction in learning and development. The principle holds that learning occurs in this "zone" where a learner can perform a task under adult guidance or with peer collaboration that they could not accomplish alone.
Applying this concept to the game design of Haplopraxis can create a dynamic and adaptive learning environment. By providing support and gradually increasing the complexity of tasks, the game could help players improve their skills and understanding.
Your mention of the Intelligence as Care Hypothesis also brings an interesting dimension to this. This hypothesis suggests that caring relationships play a vital role in cognitive development. In the context of Haplopraxis, this could translate into elements like cooperative gameplay, mentor characters, or supportive AI that guides the player's learning experience.
For example, an AI-powered guide bot in the game could serve the role of the "more knowledgeable other" that Vygotsky emphasized. This bot could offer hints, provide feedback, and scaffold the player's learning process, gradually reducing its assistance as the player becomes more competent. Through such an approach, the game could promote not only technical skills like typing and logic circuit construction, but also social-emotional skills like collaboration, empathy, and perseverance.
1 / 1
Social Interaction and Language: Vygotsky emphasized the role of social interaction, particularly with more skilled individuals or peers, in promoting cognitive development. He highlighted the significance of language as a tool for communication and cognitive growth. This emphasis on social interaction and language aligns with the intelligence as Care Hypothesis, which recognizes the role of social relationships and effective communication in nurturing and expanding intelligence.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, Vygotsky's theory greatly emphasized the role of social interactions and language in cognitive development. His view was that through interactions with peers and more skilled individuals, learners can acquire new strategies and insights, thereby facilitating their cognitive development.
Language is particularly crucial in this process as it's considered the primary means of communication and transmission of knowledge. According to Vygotsky, language serves as a psychological tool that mediates and facilitates thought processes and learning.
To incorporate these principles in your game, Haplopraxis, you might consider including features that allow for meaningful interaction among players. For instance:
Cooperative tasks: These could require players to work together, encouraging dialogue and collaboration. Through these interactions, players could exchange ideas, solve problems, and learn from each other, in alignment with Vygotsky's concept of learning within the Zone of Proximal Development.
Language-based tasks: These could be incorporated to stimulate players' language skills and cognitive development. For example, players could be required to communicate their strategies in writing or verbally, or to decode messages or clues.
In-game community: Establishing an in-game community could also promote social interaction. This could be a platform where players share their game experiences, strategies, and ideas. More experienced players could also provide guidance to new players, mirroring the relationship between the "more knowledgeable other" and the learner in Vygotsky's theory.
The Guidebot: As mentioned previously, the Guidebot could simulate social interaction to a certain extent, providing hints, support, and feedback in a language-rich environment.
Social-emotional learning: Incorporate game elements that allow players to express care for others, empathize with different situations, and collaborate effectively. This links to the intelligence as Care Hypothesis by highlighting the role of caring relationships in cognitive and emotional development.
These features, combined with the diverse gameplay elements and the adaptable difficulty levels you've already planned, could result in a rich, interactive, and highly engaging learning environment in line with Vygotsky's principles.
1 / 1
Cultural Tools and Mediation: Vygotsky proposed that cultural tools, such as language, symbols, and artifacts, mediate individuals' thinking and learning. These cultural tools serve as a means for individuals to interact with and understand the world. This idea connects to the intelligence as Care Hypothesis, which acknowledges the influence of cultural and contextual factors on the development of intelligence and the use of tools and resources to support support cognitive processes.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. According to Vygotsky's cultural-historical theory, humans use tools that develop from their culture to interact and mediate their relationship with the world. These tools can be physical (like a computer or a book) or symbolic (such as language or mathematical symbols).
Cultural tools play a key role in cognitive development. They allow us to externalize our mental processes, transform our external activities into internal cognitive processes, and pass on knowledge from one generation to another.
Translating this to your game, Haplopraxis, consider the following:
Language and Symbols: As the primary cultural tools, they should have a substantial presence in the game. The game's interface and mechanics could employ intuitive symbols and language, fostering understanding and engagement.
Tool Use: Incorporate the use of tools or artifacts within the game that players can use to interact with the game environment. The nature and complexity of these tools can be adapted to the player's development stage.
Customization: Allowing players to customize certain aspects of the game (such as their avatar, spaceship, home planet, etc.) could allow them to express their individuality and culture, reinforcing the idea of cultural tools.
Shared Culture: Within the game's community, players could develop their shared language, symbols, and strategies, essentially creating their 'in-game culture'. This could be encouraged through forums, in-game communication, and collaborative challenges.
In-game Learning: As players progress, they could be exposed to more complex concepts (like the logical gate circuits you mentioned earlier). These can serve as advanced 'cultural tools' within the context of the game, facilitating higher-level cognitive processes.
By incorporating these aspects into Haplopraxis, you would be integrating Vygotsky's concept of cultural tools and mediation, providing a rich and culturally immersive gaming experience that supports cognitive development.

The "g" key triggers a global reset for all players in the game. When the global reset occurs, all players are returned to the beginning of the game, meaning that they lose all progress and have to start over.

However, players can protect themselves from a global reset by enabling autoblink. Autoblink is a setting that increases the chances of not being reset when the "g" key is pressed.

With autoblink enabled, if a global reset occurs, the player will still be reset in time, but they will not lose their points, which are associated with marked vocabulary items representing the planets they have visited in terms of the bubbles they have popped.

To avoid popping the outermost bubble, players have to blink while passing through the boundary. If they do not blink, the bubble will pop, and the player will lose points.

I hope that helps clarify the rules of the game!

User
It does, thank you. But you don't lose points for popping a bubble, you lose all your points when the game is reset, unless you are blinking.

You want to not pop certain bubbles because you should look to find the most nested bubble (innermost scope).

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. Thank you for correcting me. You are correct that popping a bubble does not result in a loss of points.

The points are only lost when the game is reset, except for players who are blinking, who will not lose their points. 

And you are also correct that finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope) is important in the game. Thank you for clarifying these points.

User
Ok a final summary.

ChatGPT
Sure! Here's a summary of the topics we covered in this conversation:

We started by discussing the impact of a researcher's measurement choice on performance.

Then we talked about Spherepop, a hypothetical 3D programming language where programs are written by growing bubbles and evaluated by popping them.

We then shifted to discussing Haplopraxis, a space exploration and typing tutor game. The goal of the game is to explore planets by flying a spaceship and popping bubbles associated with vocabulary words.

You lose all your points if the game is reset, except if you are blinking, which can be enabled with autoblink or super autoblink.

The global reset key is 'g'.

Finally, we clarified some of the details about the game, including the controls for flying the spaceship and the mechanics of popping bubbles and avoiding resets.

I hope this summary is helpful!

User
Yes it is, thank you.

Certainly, here's a summary of what I've understood about your game, Haplopraxis, based on our conversation:
Haplopraxis is a game that combines elements from various games and inspirations including Stars!, Descent, Minesweeper, Bubble Pop, the "flying through space" screensaver, Commander Keen, MS Typing Tutor, Age of Empires, Waterworks Leaky Pipe game, and the concept of logical gate circuits.
The game features an element of space exploration, where players visit planets and pop bubbles associated with vocabulary words.
It includes a typing tutor aspect, thus serving as an educational game to help players improve their typing skills.
Haplopraxis aims to simulate the evolution of the universe using Ising synchs.
The game employs a Vygtoskian ladder of proximal graduations, adjusting its gameplay based on the skill level of the player. For infants, it simplifies into a bubble pop game; for elementary schoolers, it becomes a typing tutor; if no viewer is detected, it defaults to a screen saver tutorial.
The game features a guidebot, which automatically plays through the tutorial, demonstrating possible gameplay and controls, and revealing Easter eggs.
There is a global reset function, triggered by pressing the 'g' key, which returns all players to the start of the game, making them lose all progress. However, a setting called autoblink can protect players from a global reset, allowing them to keep their points.
The game incorporates a strategy of finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope), and players are encouraged to blink when passing through the boundary of a bubble to avoid popping it.
These are the key aspects of Haplopraxis that I've gathered from our conversation. If there's anything incorrect or missing, or if you'd like to elaborate more on any of these points, please let me know!

That is great I wonder if you can give an etymology, the word derives from the Greek for "simple practice"
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The term "Haplopraxis" indeed appears to derive from Greek roots. Let's break it down:
"Haplo-" is a prefix originating from the Greek word "haplous," which means "simple" or "single." This prefix is often used in biological terms to refer to a single unit or a single form.
"Praxis" comes from the Greek "prassein" or "prattein" which means "to do, act, perform, practice."
So, when combined, "Haplopraxis" can be roughly translated as "simple practice" or "single action" from Greek. In the context of your game, this could relate to the idea of performing simple actions or practices (such as typing or bubble popping) that build up to a more complex gameplay experience.

Ok I am not even going to go into some of the input methods they are like 3d swype traces, there is a way to input text using just the mouse, the arrow keys, or the hjkl keys, inspired by the idea of an invisible plastic onscreen keyboard.

It sounds like Haplopraxis will feature a variety of innovative input methods, allowing for different types of player interaction and engagement. The idea of an "invisible plastic onscreen keyboard" brings to mind a flexible, intuitive interface that adapts to the player's inputs. These different methods can enhance accessibility and offer unique ways for players to engage with the game.
3D Swype Traces
: This suggests a system where users can "draw" or trace paths in a 3D space to input commands or interact with game elements. This could make for a very immersive and tactile form of input.
Mouse-based Text Input
: This might involve a system where players can input text by clicking on a virtual keyboard or by drawing gestures with the mouse.
Arrow Keys or HJKL Keys
: The arrow keys are widely used for navigation in games. Using HJKL keys for navigation is a practice common among users of the Vim text editor, a tool known for its efficiency and keyboard-focused interaction. Integrating such methods can cater to players who prefer keyboard-based inputs and could also serve as a nod to Vim users.
These innovative input methods can add a lot of depth and uniqueness to your game. It will be interesting to see how these methods evolve during development and how players respond to them!
