The tree of knowledge is a new theory of cosmic evolution that stretches from the
Big Bang to the present. As shown, it depicts the evolution of complexity in
four phases or dimensions, matter, life, mind, and culture. The diagram also shows
how science emerges out of culture and functions to map the four dimensions of
existence. The TOK can be thought of as a new theory of both reality and our
scientific knowledge of it. One of the key features of the TOK is that it gives
us a new way to define mind in relationship to matter, and this sets
the stage for solving the problem of psychology. For more information on the
Tree of Knowledge and the problem of psychology, see the TOK video series or
go to the publications, blog sections, or podcasts. The Tree of Knowledge is the
primary idea that frames the worldview taken by the theory of knowledge society.
