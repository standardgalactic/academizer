Invocation Model of Process Expression
Summarize and explain:
Chapter 1: "A Critical Review of the Notion of the Algorithm in Computer 
Science." Computer science is very different from mathematics. The 
theory of mathematics is inappropriate to the concerns of computer 
science. The notion of the algorithm does not serve as an effectual con￾ceptual model for computer science.
Chapter 2: "The Simplicity of Concurrency." The complexity of concur￾rency is an artifact of a particular conceptual point of view. From a 
slightly different point of view concurrency is conceptually simpler than 
sequentiality. The notion of sequentiality has injected unnecessary cost, 
risk, and ineffi ciency into the building and use of computers.
Chapter 3: "Dehumanizing Computer Science." This chapter deposes the 
mischievous humans in the works. The theory of computer science is not 
a theory at all. Including arbitrarily capable humans in the substance of 
a theory can make any theory work. Saying a human does it in computer 
science is like saying a god does it in physics. These humans can be 
eliminated from the theoretical works, and their elimination is impera￾tive to a viable theory of computer science.
Chapter 4: "Transcending the Variable." The notion that a variable name 
refers to a location in state memory leads to clumsy structures and pro￾cedures with unnecessarily complex consequences. If one simply takes a 
different view of what a variable name expresses the clumsy complexities 
disappear.
Chapter 5: "The Invocation Model." The invocation model of process 
expression is concurrent and distributed at its foundations and discovers, 
in a spectrum of expression, the common conceptual thread running 
through all forms of process expression. It unifi es forms of process 
expression previously considered quite disparate such as the processes 
of cell metabolism, of digital computers, and of neural networks.
Chapter 6: "Along the Spectrum." Examples of expression along the spec￾trum of differentiation are presented and discussed.
Chapter 7: "Composing Boundaries." Complex processes in the form of 
spontaneously behaving pipeline structures are expressed by composing 
and coordinating behavior boundaries.
Chapter 8: "Time and Memory." Intermediate persistence memory 
extends expression through time, enables association of differentness 
through time and the appreciation of patterns of differentness through 
time.
Chapter 9: "Incidental Time." Extension of expression through time can 
serve other purposes than the appreciation of differentness through time.
 
Chapter 10: "Points of View." There can be different views of what is different and how the differentnesses interact. Considering and understanding points of view is critical to understanding process expression.
Chapter 11: "Referential and Autonomous Process Expression." Autonomous expression behaves spontaneously and must be complete in all 
aspects. Referential expression can be incomplete with expressional 
short-hands and with appeal to universal conventions, but it must still 
be mappable to autonomous expression.
Chapter 12: "The Invocation Language." The invocation language is an 
embodiment of the invocation model in symbol string expression.
Chapter 13: "Refl ections." This chapter is a summary discussion of the 
main themes of the book.
This book provides the theoretical derivation for NULL Convention Logic, 
which is presented in my previous book.1

The book is divided into 13 chapters that cover a range of topics related to computer science theory. Chapter 1 argues that the notion of the algorithm is not an effective conceptual model for computer science. Chapter 2 contends that concurrency is conceptually simpler than sequentiality, despite the complexity often associated with it. Chapter 3 suggests that the inclusion of humans in the theoretical works of computer science is unnecessary and can hinder progress. Chapter 4 proposes a new view of variables that eliminates unnecessary complexity. Chapter 5 explores the invocation model of process expression, which unifies disparate forms of process expression. Chapter 6 presents examples of expression along the spectrum of differentiation. Chapter 7 explains how complex processes can be expressed using pipeline structures. Chapter 8 discusses intermediate persistence memory and its role in extending expression through time. Chapter 9 suggests that extension of expression through time can serve other purposes than just the appreciation of differentness through time. Chapter 10 emphasizes the importance of considering and understanding different points of view in process expression. Chapter 11 distinguishes between referential and autonomous process expression. Chapter 12 describes the invocation language as a symbol string expression of the invocation model. Finally, Chapter 13 is a summary discussion of the main themes of the book. The book provides the theoretical derivation for NULL Convention Logic, which is presented in the author's previous book. The author acknowledges the companionship, partnership, and support of several individuals throughout the book's development.

Summarize:
These authors have sensed an inappropriate conceptual discrimination or 
simply an incompleteness and proposed a remedy. Programs that do not terminate, are not deterministic, and do not give specifi c solutions can now be 
"included." They are no longer simply nonalgorithmic, they now have positive 
labels, but simply assigning labels to nonalgorithms misses the point. The point 
is that algorithm-nonalgorithm is not a conceptual distinction that contributes 
to an understanding of process expression.
As a paradigm of process expression, the notion of the algorithm is decidedly defi cient. It offers no suggestion as to how an operation might be precisely 
defi ned. Nor does it suggest how a sequence should be determined. Data are 
not even mentioned. The defi nition simply states that an algorithm must 
consist of a sequence of precisely defi ned operations. This unsupported imperative is at once an admission of expressional incompleteness and a refusal to 
be complete. The other algorithmic properties of termination, correctness, and 
determination, while important to issues of computation, are quite irrelevant 
to issues of process expression.
The notion of the algorithm simply does not provide conceptual enlightenment for the questions that most computer scientists are concerned with.
1.5 CONCLUSION
What is essentially a discipline of pure mathematics has come to be called "the 
theory of computer science," and the notion of the algorithm has been decreed 
to be a fundamental paradigm of computer science. The mathematical perspective, however, is the wrong point of view. It is asking the wrong questions. 
Mathematicians and computer scientists are pursuing fundamentally different 
aims, and the mathematician's tools are not as appropriate as was once supposed to the questions of the computer scientist. The primary questions of 
computer science are not of computational possibilities but of expressional 
possibilities. Computer science does not need a theory of computation; it 
needs a comprehensive theory of process expression.
1 / 1
The authors suggest that the concept of algorithm as a fundamental paradigm of computer science is inappropriate and incomplete for understanding process expression. They argue that the focus should be on expressional possibilities rather than computational possibilities and that computer science needs a comprehensive theory of process expression rather than a theory of computation. The properties of termination, correctness, and determination are important for computation but not relevant for process expression. The authors propose a remedy for this conceptual discrimination or incompleteness.

OF CONCURRENCY
1 / 1
Concurrency refers to the ability of a computer system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. The concept of concurrency may seem complex, but the article argues that it is actually a very simple concept.
The article explains that concurrency is based on the idea of interleaving, which is a way of executing two or more tasks by dividing them into small pieces and then alternating between them. This allows the computer to make progress on multiple tasks at the same time, even though it is actually only executing one piece of a task at a time.
The article argues that concurrency is a fundamental concept in computer science, and that it is important for developers to understand how it works in order to write efficient and effective programs. By understanding concurrency, developers can design systems that are more responsive and can handle larger workloads.
Overall, the article suggests that while concurrency may seem complex, it is actually a simple and powerful concept that can help developers create better software.

The expression of sequentiality is generally considered to be simple and relable, whereas the expression of concurrency is perceived to be complex and i

nherently unreliable. This is because concurrent systems have to deal with issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks, which can make it difficult to predict the behavior of the system. Additionally, debugging concurrent systems can be much more challenging than debugging sequential systems, as bugs can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose.
However, there are benefits to using concurrency in systems, such as improved performance and responsiveness. In order to make concurrent systems more reliable and easier to work with, there are various techniques and tools that can be used, such as locking mechanisms, message passing, and thread-safe data structures.
Overall, while concurrency may be perceived as more complex and unreliable than sequentiality, it can provide significant benefits when used effectively and with the appropriate tools and techniques.

nondeterministic. Sequentiality is accepted as a primitive form of expression
1 / 1
Correct, sequentiality is often considered a primitive form of expression because it is a fundamental concept in programming and computing. It involves executing instructions or operations one after another in a specific order, which makes it a reliable and predictable way of expressing processes. On the other hand, concurrency involves executing multiple operations simultaneously or in an overlapping manner, which can be more complex and harder to control. This is because concurrency introduces non-deterministic behavior, where the order of execution and the outcome can vary depending on the timing and scheduling of the operations. However, concurrency is also essential for many modern computing applications, such as multi-core processors, distributed systems, and parallel computing, because it enables more efficient use of resources and faster processing of large amounts of data.

and concurrency is characterized in terms of sequentiality. It is argued here
1 / 1
that this view is limiting and does not fully capture the expressive power of concurrency.
Concurrency can be seen as a separate and distinct form of expression, rather than just a combination of sequential processes. Concurrency allows multiple processes to execute simultaneously, creating opportunities for parallelism and communication between processes.
While it may be more challenging to reason about concurrent systems compared to sequential systems, it also allows for more efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems. In some cases, concurrent solutions may be the only viable approach.
Therefore, it is important to recognize the expressive power of concurrency and develop tools and techniques to reason about concurrent systems effectively. This will enable us to leverage the benefits of concurrency and build more efficient and scalable systems.

1 / 1
concurrency is a result of our cultural biases and the limitations of our current programming languages and tools.
In reality, concurrency is a fundamental aspect of many natural and artificial systems, and it can often be expressed more simply and elegantly than sequentiality. For example, consider the behavior of a flock of birds or a school of fish, which exhibit complex coordinated behavior through concurrent interactions. Similarly, many distributed systems and parallel algorithms rely on concurrency to achieve efficient and scalable performance.
The complexity of concurrency in programming arises largely from the difficulty of reasoning about and coordinating multiple concurrent threads of execution. However, there are emerging programming models and languages, such as actor-based systems and functional reactive programming, that provide simpler and more composable abstractions for concurrency.
In summary, the perceived simplicity of sequentiality and complexity of concurrency are largely artifacts of our current programming paradigms and cultural biases. As we continue to develop more advanced programming languages and tools, we can expect to see concurrency become increasingly natural and intuitive to express and reason about.
1 / 1
concurrency is an artifact of a particular conceptual view; it is not unlike the
1 / 1
perception of the earth being flat, which was an artifact of a limited perspective. In reality, concurrency is not inherently more complex than sequentiality. It is simply a different way of expressing processes.
The perceived complexity of concurrency arises from the fact that it involves multiple processes that can potentially interact with each other in non-deterministic ways. However, this complexity can be managed through the use of appropriate tools and techniques, such as synchronization primitives and formal methods.
Furthermore, concurrency offers several advantages over sequentiality, such as increased efficiency and scalability. Many real-world systems, such as operating systems and distributed applications, rely heavily on concurrency to achieve their goals.
Therefore, it is important to recognize that concurrency is not inherently more complex than sequentiality, but rather a different way of expressing processes that offers unique advantages and challenges.

classical mechanics, before the development of the theory of relativity. In other words, the perceived complexity of concurrency may be due to a limited conceptual framework, rather than an inherent property of concurrent systems.
The authors argue that by adopting a different conceptual framework, based on process expression rather than computation, the perceived complexity of concurrency can be reduced. They propose a comprehensive theory of process expression as a more appropriate approach to understanding concurrency.
In summary, the complexity of concurrency may be an artifact of a limited conceptual view, and a different approach based on process expression could offer a simpler and more comprehensive understanding of concurrent systems.

1 / 1
The statement is comparing the perception of the complexity of concurrency to the perceived impossibility of traveling to the moon while using an outdated and inaccurate model of the solar system, which involved the use of cycles and epicycles in crystalline spheres. The implication is that the perception of concurrency as complex may be due to an outdated conceptual view of computing and process expression.

The diffi culty lies in the notion of the mathematical function, which is a
1 / 1
mapping between inputs and outputs that is well-defined and deterministic. In a concurrent system, the inputs and outputs may not be well-defined or may not be deterministic, as multiple processes can access and modify shared resources simultaneously.
However, there are ways to express concurrency in a more natural and intuitive way. One approach is through the use of message passing, where processes communicate with each other through messages rather than accessing shared resources directly. Another approach is through the use of higher-level abstractions such as threads and coroutines, which allow for more flexible and expressive concurrency.
Ultimately, the perception of the complexity of concurrency is a result of the limitations of our current conceptual framework. As our understanding of concurrency continues to evolve and new abstractions and tools are developed, we may find that concurrency is not so complex after all.

other functions. However, in the context of expressing processes, coordination behavior is crucial, and the concept of a mathematical function is inadequate. Instead, we need a more expressive framework that can capture the complexity of coordination and concurrency.
The solution proposed by the authors is the use of Petri nets, a graphical formalism that can represent both sequential and concurrent processes. Petri nets are based on the notion of tokens, which represent the state of a process, and places and transitions, which represent the activities and dependencies between activities in the process.
Using Petri nets, it is possible to represent complex coordination behaviors and concurrent activities in a clear and concise way. Petri nets can also be analyzed and verified using mathematical techniques, providing a rigorous foundation for the study of concurrent systems.
In summary, the authors argue that the simplicity of sequentiality and the complexity of concurrency are not inherent properties of the processes themselves, but rather a result of the limitations of the conceptual frameworks used to express them. By using more expressive formalisms such as Petri nets, we can overcome these limitations and achieve a more comprehensive understanding of concurrent processes.

other functions. The expressivity of coordination traditionally resides in a
1 / 1
more general notion of process, which involves the notion of time and causal relationships. In the context of computer science, concurrency involves the coordination of multiple processes that can execute simultaneously and interact with each other in complex ways. This coordination involves not just the execution of individual instructions, but also the synchronization and communication between processes. This complexity can be managed through the use of appropriate programming languages and abstractions, but it requires a shift in perspective away from the simple mapping relations of mathematical functions. In summary, the complexity of concurrency is not inherent, but rather a result of the coordination and interaction between multiple processes over time.

1 / 1
The traditional view of coordination in computer science is limited by the notion of mathematical functions, which do not express coordination behavior with other functions. The expressivity of coordination, therefore, typically depends on a mathematician to coordinate the behavior of functions. Without a mathematician, the behavior of a system of functions may be uncoordinated and nondeterministic.

The missing coordination expression of the mathematician can be restored by adopting a model that includes concurrency as a primitive notion of process expression. This model, called the process algebra, provides a set of rules for expressing coordination behavior among processes. It allows for the explicit expression of coordination behavior, making it possible to reason about and analyze concurrent systems. By adopting process algebra as a model of process expression, the perceived complexity of concurrency can be overcome, and the coordination expression of the missing mathematician can be restored.

in two different ways that lead to radically different views of process expresion. In one view, sequentiality is simple and primitive and concurrency is a s
1 / 1
econdary and complex feature that can be understood in terms of sequentiality. In the other view, concurrency is a fundamental and primitive aspect of process expression, and sequentiality is a special case of concurrency that can be understood as a limiting behavior of highly coordinated concurrency.
The first view sees process expression as a collection of independent sequential processes that are combined to form larger processes through coordination mechanisms that impose synchronization and communication constraints on their behavior. This view is based on the assumption that sequentiality is simple and reliable, and that concurrency is a difficult and error-prone feature that needs to be carefully managed.
The second view sees process expression as a collection of highly coordinated concurrent processes that are capable of expressing complex and sophisticated behaviors through the interaction and synchronization of their constituent parts. This view is based on the assumption that concurrency is a fundamental and powerful feature of process expression, and that sequentiality is a special case of concurrency that can be understood as a highly constrained and simplified form of coordination.
Both views have their strengths and weaknesses, and both can be useful in different contexts and for different purposes. The key to understanding process expression lies in recognizing the importance of concurrency as a fundamental aspect of the phenomenon, and in developing appropriate conceptual and mathematical tools for analyzing and manipulating concurrent processes.

case of concurrency. The first view is based on the assumption that processes must be decomposable into simple, sequentially executable steps. This view is well-suited for analyzing systems where the order of execution is critical and the behavior of each step is predictable. However, in complex systems where the order of execution is not critical and the behavior of each step is uncertain, the second view, which considers concurrency as the primitive form of expression, is more appropriate.
In this view, concurrency is seen as the natural expression of systems with multiple, interacting components that must coordinate their behavior to achieve a common goal. Rather than decomposing processes into sequential steps, concurrency allows processes to be expressed as collections of interacting components that operate independently of one another. This approach can lead to more flexible and robust systems, but it requires a different set of tools and techniques for analyzing and designing processes.

case of concurrency.
1 / 1
Yes, that is correct. The two views represent different perspectives on the nature of process expression and the role of coordination in it. The first view sees sequentiality as the default and natural form of expression, and concurrency as a more complex and risky alternative that requires careful coordination to ensure correct behavior. The second view, on the other hand, sees concurrency as the default and natural form of expression, and sequentiality as a special case that requires explicit coordination to achieve. Both views have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system being modeled or implemented.

Summarize:
2.1 THE PRIMACY OF SEQUENTIALITY
For a number of seemingly good conceptual and practical reasons sequentiality is considered to be a fundamental primitive form of process expression. A 
strong conceptual motivation for sequentiality comes from the theory of computer science adopted from the theory of mathematics. The notion of the 
algorithm characterizes a computational process as a strict sequence of precisely defi ned operations. From the mathematicians point of view, any concurrent expression (a partial ordering) can be reduced to a sequential expression 
(a total ordering). Sequential expression is a suffi cient theoretical primitive so 
there is no theoretical necessity to consider concurrency on its own terms. 
Sequentiality appears to reside at a reductive conceptual bottom.
There are practical motivations. A transistor can only do one thing at a 
time in sequence. There is the convenience of generally confi guring a system 
by using a single element over and over in sequence. There is the sense that 
humans seem to think, intellectually at least, in a step-by-step manner. There 
is the unprecedented success at building and using sequential computing 
machines.
But most infl uential is that concurrency appears to be complex, even nondeterministic, and chaotic, like a hydra-headed beast that must be wrestled 
into submission. Sequential expression, by contrast, seems simple, straightforward, and tractable. It only makes good sense to appeal to the simplicity of 
sequentiality to tame the complexity of concurrency.
Accordingly, sequentiality is regarded as a primitive form of process expression and concurrency is characterized in terms of sequentiality as cooperating 
sequential processes [5], communicating sequential processes [3], interleaved 
sequential processes [2], and so on.
2.2 THE COMPLEXITY OF CONCURRENCY
The complexity of concurrency manifests itself in a number of forms, and all 
relate to unruly behavior. It just seems obvious that controlling a gaggle of 
multiple events all at once should be more diffi cult than controlling one thing 
at a time in sequence.
2.2.1 The Demon of Indeterminacy
The introduction of concurrency into computation opens Pandora's box to 
release the possibility of nondeterminacy and a host of other complications, 
including deadlock and livelock. . . . Events within concurrent systems do not 
necessarily occur at predetermined times, but may occur in different orders 
depending upon the relative speeds of different system parts. The usual assumption, which is also physically realistic, is that relative speeds cannot be controlled 
so precisely that the designer or programmer can depend upon them to enforce 
sequencing requirements
1 / 1
This passage discusses the perception of sequentiality as a fundamental and simple form of process expression, while concurrency is viewed as complex and non-deterministic. The concept of sequentiality is seen as a primitive form of expression due to its strong conceptual and practical motivations, such as the success of building sequential computing machines and the convenience of configuring a system using a single element in sequence. In contrast, concurrency is viewed as complex and difficult to control due to the demon of indeterminacy, which introduces the possibility of nondeterminacy and other complications, including deadlock and livelock. The introduction of concurrency into computation opens Pandora's box, which releases the possibility of these complications, and events within concurrent systems do not necessarily occur at predetermined times.
1 / 1
Events can occur in different orders depending on the relative speeds of 
different system parts. The speeds of the parts cannot be controlled to avoid 
the different orderings and most of the possible different orderings do not 
result in a correct answer.
Unfortunately, asynchronous circuits are diffi cult to design because they are 
concurrent systems. When trying to understand a synchronous circuit, it is possible to pretend that events occur in lock-step. Variations in the speeds of functional elements can be ignored, since the clock is timed to allow for the worst-case 
delays. the lock-step model does not work for speed-independent designs—a 
correct design must exhibit proper behavior no matter what the speeds of its 
components. When several components are operating concurrently, there may 
be a very large number of possible execution paths, each corresponding to a 
different set of delays in the components. Nondeterminism resulting from 
unknown or varying delays is the essential problem in all concurrent systems. 
For a property to hold for a concurrent system it must hold for every possible 
execution. [1]
By "must hold for every possible execution" it is meant that if all the possible execution paths (orderings of components/events) give the same correct 
result, the problem of many different orderings can be overcome. The fi rst 
step in resolving this expressional diffi culty is to determine all the possible 
execution paths. This is called the state space explosion problem.
2.2.2 The State Space Explosion
Although the architectural freedom of asynchronous systems is a great benefi t, 
it also poses a diffi cult challenge. Because each part sets its own pace, that pace 
may vary from time to time in any one system and may vary from system to 
system. If several actions are concurrent, they may fi nish in a large number of 
possible sequences, Enumerating all the possible sequences of actions in a 
complex asynchronous chip is as diffi cult as predicting the sequences of actions 
in a schoolyard full of children. This dilemma is called the state explosion 
problem. Can chip designers create order out of the potential chaos of concurrent actions? [9]
The state space of the process must include all the possible states of 
all the possible correct and incorrect orderings, including incorrect states 
due to critical timing relationships (glitches). For a concurrent expression of 
any practical size the state space that must be considered can become 
enormous.
Only after enumerating all the possible sequences (orderings of components-events-actions, execution paths) through the expanded state space can 
one begin to attempt to reduce the possible sequences and to make each execution sequence unambiguously result in a transition to the correct fi nal 
state
1 / 1
This section discusses the challenges of concurrency in computing, and why sequentiality is often preferred. Concurrency can lead to non-determinacy, as events can occur in different orders due to varying speeds of system components. Asynchronous circuits are difficult to design as they are concurrent systems, and a correct design must exhibit proper behavior regardless of the speeds of its components. This leads to a large number of possible execution paths, or orderings of events, which must be considered in the state space of the process. The state space explosion problem arises due to the difficulty of enumerating all the possible sequences through the expanded state space.

Summarize:
2.2.3 Elusive Confi dence
Faced with such complexity of behavior it is diffi cult to attain confi dence in 
the behavior of a concurrent system.
concurrent programming is much more diffi cult than sequential programming 
because of the diffi culty of ensuring that a concurrent program is correct. [2]
Reliably reproducible behavior is the critical ingredient of confi dence. The 
many possible orderings of concurrency does not contribute to confi dence.
Our ability to test a large sequential program in small steps depends fundamentally on the reproducible behavior of the program. [4]
The important thing about a sequential program is that it always gives the same 
results when it operates on the same data independently of how fast it is executed. 
All that matters is the sequence in which the operations are carried out. [4]
Convenient state visibility is lost with concurrent behavior. The fi rst diffi -
culty is the state space explosion. The state space to consider is just much 
larger than a sequential state space. The second diffi culty is that with concurrent events there is no reliable way to determine when an extended state is 
stable and can be sampled. Even if one is able to sample the extended state, 
one must also be able to discern which order of events (execution path) is in 
play to analyze the sampled state.
With sequentiality it is assumed that each event completes before the next 
event begins. In the interval between events a stable state of the system can 
be sampled to verify the correct behavior of each event in turn. In the context 
of state behavior it is clearly easier to observe and trust the behavior of 
sequentiality than it is to observe and trust the behavior of concurrency.
2.2.4 Confusions
If concurrent behavior is so impossibly complex, how is it possible that anything at all is designed to reliably operate with concurrent behavior? The 
natural world operates with massively concurrent behaviors and almost every 
human artifact including computers operate reliably with concurrent behaviors. The situation can't possibly be as bad as it appears.
Having adopted this assumption of arbitrary speed, the designer or programmer 
proceeds to construct systems that enforce the sequencing that is logically necessary to the computation. Sequencing can, for example, be enforced by such 
causal mechanisms as signals, shared variables, or messages between concurrent 
processes. [8]
Since one cannot rely on timing relationships to control concurrent events 
one must rely on "causal mechanisms" or, in other words, logical relationships
1 / 1
The complexity of concurrency makes it difficult to attain confidence in the behavior of concurrent systems. Testing a large sequential program depends on the reproducible behavior of the program, which is lost in concurrent behavior. The state space explosion and the lack of reliable ways to determine stable states and execution paths add to the confusion. However, designers can construct systems that enforce necessary sequencing through causal mechanisms such as signals, shared variables, or messages between concurrent processes. Logical relationships are relied upon instead of timing relationships to control concurrent events. Despite the challenges, the natural world and human artifacts, including computers, operate reliably with concurrent behavior.
1 / 1
to manage concurrent events. If concurrency can in fact be managed with 
logical relationships, why all the agonizing about timing relationships? Why 
are time relationships considered at all? Why is concurrency not considered 
purely in terms of logical relationships to begin with? The answers lie with the 
mathematical notion of the function.
2.3 THE ROOTS OF APPARENT COMPLEXITY
A mathematical function is a mapping from an input data state to an output 
data state. Neither the expression of the mathematical function nor the expression of the data state includes the expression of how the function might 
interact with other functions, how an instance of input data presented to the 
function might be bounded (when it begins and when it ends), or how the 
result of the function might be presented and bounded (when it is valid and 
when it is not valid). These aspects of a functions' behavior were, historically, 
expressed by a mathematician with a pencil. The mathematician understands 
the proper fl ow of data among the functions and can correctly manage the 
behavior of each function and the fl ow of data among functions. But when 
functions are obliged to behave on their own, in the absence of the mathematician, the expression of this coordinating behavior embodied in the mathematician is lost.
How the lost expressivity of the missing mathematician is re-established is 
the root of the confusion and the crux of the matter.
2.3.1 The Behavior of Mathematical Functions
The Boolean combinational logic expression of Figure 2.1, which is a network 
of concurrent or partially ordered Boolean functions, is taken as an exemplar 
of a concurrent system of mathematical functions. There is the expression of 
each function and the expression of the partial ordering (data paths, association relationships) among the functions. There is no expression of coordination of behavior among the functions. There is no expression of when a 
function should behave and when a function should not behave, so the data 
paths and the functions must be presumed to behave continuously.
When the inputs of a Boolean combinational expression are presented with 
a new instance of input data, a wavefront of stable correct result values flow
1 / 1
through the network until all output values have stabilized. The behavior
of a mathematical function is purely deterministic and reproducible given
the same input data. However, the lack of coordination of behavior among
the functions in a concurrent system of mathematical functions can lead to
complex and unpredictable behavior.

Summarize the chapter so far.
1 / 1
Chapter 2 of "The Mythical Man-Month" explores the challenges of designing and managing concurrent systems, which are systems that execute multiple tasks simultaneously. The author argues that concurrent programming is more difficult than sequential programming because ensuring the correctness of a concurrent program is much more challenging. The state space explosion and the lack of reliable ways to determine when an extended state is stable and can be sampled are some of the difficulties of concurrency. The author notes that the natural world operates with massively concurrent behaviors, and human artifacts, including computers, operate reliably with concurrent behaviors. The chapter then discusses the roots of apparent complexity in concurrent systems, emphasizing the behavior of mathematical functions and how the lost expressivity of the missing mathematician is re-established. The chapter suggests that concurrent systems need coordination of behavior, and the crux of the matter is how to express it.

The chapter discusses the challenges of designing and programming concurrent systems, where multiple processes or threads run simultaneously and interact with each other. It emphasizes that concurrent programming is more difficult than sequential programming due to the difficulty of ensuring correct behavior in the presence of many possible orderings of events.
The chapter also highlights the importance of reproducible behavior for confidence in a program's correctness. It discusses the challenges of observing and trusting the behavior of concurrent systems, including the loss of convenient state visibility and the difficulty of determining when an extended state is stable and can be sampled.
The chapter goes on to discuss the roots of apparent complexity in concurrent systems, focusing on the behavior of mathematical functions and how the expression of coordinating behavior can be lost in the absence of a mathematician. It uses a Boolean combinational logic expression as an example of a concurrent system of mathematical functions and illustrates how inputs and outputs can become tangled and out of sync without proper coordination.

of each function will arrive at different times and cause some functions to

behave before others. As a result, the output of the system may be incorrect and unpredictable.
This unpredictability arises from the fact that the functions are not explicitly coordinated, and their behavior is determined solely by the input data and their internal logic. In order to manage this complexity and ensure correct behavior, additional coordination mechanisms are needed, such as sequencing constraints, synchronization primitives, and mutual exclusion mechanisms.
The chapter also discusses the challenges of concurrency, including the difficulty of ensuring correct behavior in the presence of multiple concurrent events and the loss of reproducibility and state visibility. The author argues that these challenges stem from the fact that concurrency is fundamentally different from sequentiality and requires different approaches and coordination mechanisms. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the roots of apparent complexity in concurrent systems and the importance of explicit coordination mechanisms in managing this complexity.

function down the line. This can cause a cascade of errors and result in an incorrect output.
To address this issue, timing relationships are introduced to coordinate the behavior of the functions. By establishing when each function should behave and when it should not behave, the input data can be presented to the functions in a controlled and synchronized manner, preventing errors from cascading through the system.
However, coordinating the behavior of functions based solely on timing relationships can be challenging and complex. A better approach is to consider logical relationships between functions and coordinate their behavior accordingly. This can help reduce the complexity of the system and make it easier to manage concurrency.
Overall, the chapter highlights the importance of coordinating the behavior of functions in concurrent systems, and the challenges that arise in doing so. It suggests that considering both logical and timing relationships can help ensure correct and efficient operation of concurrent systems.

cumulative error may occur, leading to incorrect or unexpected output.
To prevent these errors, timing relationships must be considered and explicitly defined for each function and path in a system. These timing relationships specify when a function should behave and when it should not, as well as when data transitions are valid and when they are not.
The concept of concurrency can be managed through logical relationships, but it is necessary to consider timing relationships to ensure proper coordination of behavior among functions and data paths in the absence of a coordinating mathematician.

chaos of indeterminate result values speeds ahead of the wavefront of stable
1 / 1
result values.
This chaos of indeterminate results is due to the absence of coordination among the functions, which historically was provided by a mathematician. The mathematical function is a mapping from an input data state to an output data state, but it does not include the expression of how the function might interact with other functions or how an instance of input data presented to the function might be bounded.
Therefore, to deal with the issue of coordinating behavior among the functions, the authors introduce the concept of time relationships, which allows for the management of concurrent events. They argue that time relationships are considered because of the mathematical notion of the function, which does not express coordination among functions. The authors also discuss the behavior of mathematical functions in the absence of coordination and how temporary errors can arise, leading to a chaos of indeterminate result values.

correct results, causing the output of the Boolean expression to transition

continuously between valid and invalid values.
To address this issue, timing relationships are introduced to ensure that each function behaves correctly and that the overall system behaves correctly as well. The timing relationships define when each function should behave and when it should not, ensuring that the data transitions through the system in a well-defined and predictable manner.
The chapter also discusses the mathematical notion of the function as a mapping from an input data state to an output data state, and how the behavior of functions needs to be coordinated to ensure correct behavior of the overall system. The absence of such coordination leads to the loss of expressivity of the system and the propagation of errors.

The chapter discusses the difficulties of managing concurrency in computer systems, and how the problem arises from the fact that mathematical functions do not inherently express timing or coordination among themselves. This lack of coordination can lead to glitches and indeterminate results, which can cause serious problems in digital circuits. The chapter also introduces the concept of logical relationships and the mathematical notion of a function, which are important tools for managing concurrency in computer systems.

result.
This problem is caused by the lack of coordination and timing relationships among the functions in a concurrent system. In the absence of a coordinating mathematician, data transitions flow indiscriminately over the freely flowing paths and through the continuously responsive functions, resulting in a chaos of indeterminate result values that compound and propagate as temporary errors.
To solve this problem, the chapter proposes the use of logical relationships and timing relationships in the design and implementation of concurrent systems. Logical relationships ensure that functions behave in a coordinated manner and produce correct results, while timing relationships ensure that functions behave in a synchronized manner and produce correct results at the correct times.
The chapter also discusses the roots of apparent complexity in concurrent systems and emphasizes the importance of understanding the behavior of mathematical functions in the design and implementation of concurrent systems.

resolution of the presented input. This indeterminate behavior is a vivid manfestation of the chaos of concurrency.i
1 / 1
Yes, that's correct. The indeterminate behavior is a result of the lack of coordination among the concurrent functions in the absence of a mathematician to manage their behavior. The wavefront of stable, correct results is delayed as temporary errors propagate and compound, causing the output to transition through a large number of incorrect states before stabilizing to the correct resolution of the input. This chaotic behavior is a manifestation of the challenges of concurrency in computer science.
1 / 1
One might try to avoid the indeterminate transitions by specifi cally expresing a precise propagation delay for each component, but propagation delays, s
1 / 1
pecified in terms of physical time, are not only time-consuming to compute but also difficult to get right in practice. Furthermore, the physical delays themselves are subject to variation due to temperature, power supply voltage, and other environmental factors.
Another approach would be to synchronize the operations of the various components, using a clock to govern their behavior. However, this approach also suffers from drawbacks, such as the difficulty of ensuring precise synchronization in the face of component variations and the need for the clock to run at a speed that is consistent with the performance of the slowest component.
The solution proposed by the authors is to express concurrency not in terms of timing relationships but in terms of logical relationships. This can be achieved by designing systems as networks of communicating agents, where each agent has a well-defined behavior that is specified in terms of its interactions with other agents. By ensuring that the behavior of each agent is defined in terms of its interactions with other agents, rather than in terms of timing relationships, it becomes possible to reason about the system's behavior in a more principled way.
The authors argue that this approach is not only more expressive but also more scalable and more resilient than traditional approaches based on timing relationships. By treating concurrency as a first-class citizen in the design of systems, rather than as an afterthought, it becomes possible to build systems that are more robust, more adaptive, and more capable of handling complex interactions between components.

which can vary with a number of factors such as data dependencies, temperture, age, and manufacturing variability, cannot be reliably expressed. The a
1 / 1
uthor argues that the only way to handle the chaos of concurrency is to use a methodology that is capable of addressing it. The methodology that the author proposes is based on the use of a logical model of computation, in which the behavior of a system is defined by a set of equations that describe the logical relationships between its components. In this approach, the behavior of a system is not described in terms of timing relationships, but rather in terms of logical relationships, which can be managed to ensure correct behavior even in the presence of concurrency.

indeterminate behavior of concurrent functions cannot be avoided by manaing the propagation delays of components.g
1 / 1
Yes, managing the propagation delays of components is not a reliable solution to avoid the indeterminate behavior of concurrent functions, as these delays can vary due to several factors and cannot be precisely expressed.
1 / 1
Even if the indeterminate transitioning could be avoided, there would still
1 / 1
be issues with the coordination of behavior among the functions. The mathematician's role in managing the behavior of functions and the flow of data among them is lost when functions are obliged to behave on their own. This results in the expression of coordination behavior embodied in the mathematician being lost, which creates confusion and complexity.
In computer science, the problem of managing concurrent events is a major issue, and concurrency can be managed with logical relationships. However, timing relationships are still considered because of the mathematical notion of the function. A mathematical function is a mapping from an input data state to an output data state, and the expression of the function and its data state does not include the expression of how the function might interact with other functions or how an instance of input data presented to the function might be bounded. The aspects of a function's behavior were historically expressed by a mathematician with a pencil, but the lost expressivity of the missing mathematician is re-established through coordination and behavior management techniques.

be no means to determine from the behavior of the expression itself when the
1 / 1
next instance of input data is valid or when the output is valid. This means that the behavior of the expression must be externally constrained by signals that specify when input data is valid and when the output is valid.
The chapter also explains that the behavior of mathematical functions is a mapping from an input data state to an output data state, and that the expression of this behavior historically includes the proper flow of data among the functions and the correct management of the behavior of each function and the flow of data among functions. However, when functions behave on their own, the expressivity of this coordinating behavior is lost, which is the root of the confusion and the crux of the matter in managing concurrent events.
1 / 1
output of the expression is asserting the correct result. If the current input
1 / 1
state of a function is unknown, the state of the output is also unknown. It is impossible to determine whether the output of the expression is the correct result without knowing the input states of all the functions.
Furthermore, even if the input states of all the functions are known, the behavior of the expression as a whole is still unpredictable because the input states can change at any time due to the concurrent nature of the system.
Therefore, the key issue in managing concurrent systems is not simply managing the logical relationships between functions, but also managing the timing relationships between the inputs and outputs of the functions. Without proper management of timing relationships, the behavior of concurrent systems is unpredictable and can lead to incorrect results.

happens to identical to the previous input, the expression exhibits no transtion behavior at all, correct or incorrect.i
1 / 1
In summary, the chapter discusses the issue of managing concurrent events in computer science, specifically in the context of mathematical functions. The chapter argues that the behavior of functions is often expressed in terms of logical relationships, rather than timing relationships, which leads to a loss of expressivity when the functions are operating independently. This loss of expressivity results in indeterminate behavior, where data transitions flow indiscriminately over freely flowing paths, causing temporary errors that compound and propagate throughout the system. The chapter concludes that managing the propagation delays of components or avoiding indeterminate transitioning altogether cannot solve the problem, as there is still no means to determine when the output of the expression is asserting the correct result.
1 / 1
The boundaries of data presentation and resolution, traditionally expressed

as time relationships, are necessary to establish a coordinated behavior among concurrent functions. When the expression of how functions might interact with other functions, how input data might be bounded, and how results might be presented and bounded are lost, the expressivity of the coordinating mathematician is also lost. This leads to indeterminate behavior and chaos in the concurrent system of mathematical functions. Even if indeterminate transitioning could be avoided, there would still be no means to determine from the behavior of the expression itself when the output of the expression is asserting the correct result. The chapter emphasizes the importance of boundaries of data presentation and resolution in establishing coordinated behavior and preventing indeterminate behavior in concurrent systems.

1 / 1
Yes, that is correct. The coordination of behavior among concurrent mathematical functions is traditionally expressed by a mathematician who understands the proper flow of data among the functions and can correctly manage the behavior of each function and the flow of data among functions. However, when functions are obliged to behave on their own, in the absence of the mathematician, the expression of this coordinating behavior embodied in the mathematician is lost. This is the root of the confusion and the crux of the matter. To re-establish the expression of these boundaries, one needs to take into account the mathematical notion of a function and the behavior of mathematical functions in a concurrent system.

2.3.2 Re-establishing the Expression of Boundaries
1 / 1
To re-establish the expression of boundaries in a concurrent composition of mathematical functions, a new construct called a process is introduced. A process is a model of a function that embodies the notion of timing and data boundary conditions. It can only receive data at specific times and can only produce data at specific times.
Processes introduce the notion of time into the mathematical expression of a concurrent system, and they establish boundaries on the behavior of functions. The boundaries that processes introduce are expressed in terms of logical relationships, such as "before" and "after," rather than in terms of absolute time values. This allows for flexibility in the way that processes are scheduled and allows for optimization of the execution of the concurrent system.
Processes are composed in a way that ensures that the logical relationships among them are preserved. This ensures that the behavior of the system is correct and predictable. Processes can be thought of as "actors" that communicate with each other by passing messages. The messages that are passed between processes have associated time stamps that indicate when the message was sent and when it should be received.
By using processes to model the behavior of functions in a concurrent system, the expression of boundaries and the coordination of behavior are re-established. This allows for the correct and predictable behavior of the system even in the absence of a mathematician to manage it.

A concurrent composition of mathematical functions with a stably presented
1 / 1
A concurrent composition of mathematical functions with a stably presented input can still exhibit indeterminate behavior due to the lack of coordination among the functions. This can result in a chaotic propagation of errors through the expression before the wavefront of correct results stabilizes at the output. Propagation delays of components cannot be precisely expressed and even if they could, there would be no means to determine when the output of the expression is asserting the correct result. The boundaries of data presentation and resolution, traditionally expressed by the mathematician, are missing in a concurrent composition of mathematical functions, and the expression of these boundaries must be re-established. One way to do this is to impose timing relationships among the functions, which ensures that each function behaves only at specific times and with respect to specific inputs. However, such an approach can result in unnecessary complexity and can be difficult to manage, and so an alternative approach that considers logical relationships between functions may be more appropriate.
1 / 1
input can be relied on to eventually settle to a stable correct result of the
1 / 1
expression. However, the issue is how to ensure that the input is stably presented in the first place. To do this, the authors propose re-establishing the expression of boundaries.
The boundaries of data presentation and resolution are traditionally expressed by the mathematician who designs and specifies the system. In a concurrent composition of mathematical functions, these boundaries are missing, and the input can be presented in a chaotic and indeterminate manner. To re-establish the expression of boundaries, the authors suggest creating a "clock" signal that regulates the presentation of input data to the system.
The clock signal divides time into discrete steps, and the input data is presented at each step, synchronously with the clock. This ensures that the input data is presented in a stable and synchronized manner, and the output of the system can be reliably determined at each step. The authors suggest using a clock signal that is fast enough to ensure that the system can operate in real-time, and that the clock period is long enough to allow the system to complete its calculations and settle to a stable output.
Re-establishing the expression of boundaries in this way allows for the creation of reliable and predictable systems composed of concurrent mathematical functions.

A concurrent composition of mathematical functions with a stably presented input can eventually settle to a stable correct result of the presented input. This eventual stability can be characterized with a time interval beginning from the presentation of input with a duration of the propagation time of the slowest path in the expression plus a margin to accommodate arbitrary variations in propagation times. This time interval defines the boundary within which the output of the expression is guaranteed to settle to the correct result. By establishing and respecting this boundary, the indeterminate behavior of concurrent functions can be avoided, and the expression can be relied on to behave predictably and correctly.

the propagation variabilities of the path. This time interval can be associated
1 / 1
with the expression of boundaries, as it defines the period during which the output of the expression can be considered reliable and accurate.
To re-establish the expression of boundaries in a concurrent composition of mathematical functions, the author proposes the use of a clocked system. In this system, a central clock generates a regular pulse that is used to synchronize the execution of each function in the expression. The input data is presented to the system at the rising edge of the clock pulse, and each function is allowed to execute only within a well-defined time window, corresponding to the period between two consecutive clock pulses.
By constraining the execution of each function to a specific time window, the clocked system ensures that each function has a well-defined propagation time, which can be accounted for in the design of the system. Furthermore, by using the clock pulse as a reference, the system can determine when a transition in the output of the expression is valid and stable, and when it is the result of a temporary error that will be corrected in the next clock cycle.
The use of a clocked system allows the re-establishment of the expression of boundaries in a concurrent composition of mathematical functions, and ensures the reliable and accurate computation of the output of the expression.

with memory elements at the input and the output of the function. The
1 / 1
time interval associated with memory elements at the input and output of the function is called the setup time and hold time, respectively.
The setup time is the minimum amount of time that the input signal must be stable before the clock edge that triggers the memory element. This time is necessary to ensure that the data propagates through the combinational logic and settles to a stable value before it is latched by the memory element.
The hold time is the minimum amount of time that the input signal must remain stable after the clock edge that triggers the memory element. This time is necessary to ensure that the memory element has enough time to sample the input and hold it stable until the next clock edge.
By specifying these setup and hold times for the memory elements, we can ensure that the input signals are stable when they are latched by the memory element, and the output signals remain stable until the next clock edge. This prevents indeterminate behavior and ensures correct operation of the system.

memory element at the input presents and stably maintains the input to the

By using memory elements to establish boundaries, the indeterminate behavior of concurrent functions can be avoided, and the correct behavior of the function can be determined from the behavior of the memory elements. The use of memory elements also allows for the specification of precise timing requirements for each component, which can help ensure correct operation in the presence of variability.

the output captures and stably maintains the correct output of the expression at the end of the time interval.
In this way, the boundaries of the data presentation and resolution are re-established, allowing for reliable and stable operation of the mathematical expression. The use of memory elements at the input and output also provides a means of synchronizing concurrent functions, ensuring that they operate on the same stable input data and produce a stable output at the same time.
Overall, the re-establishment of the expression of boundaries is crucial in managing the indeterminate behavior of concurrent mathematical functions, and enables the reliable operation of complex systems built from these functions.

the output of the expression ignores the indeterminate transitions during the

The use of memory elements to establish the boundaries of the expression allows for a clear distinction between the indeterminate transitioning behavior of the expression and the eventual stable correct result. This distinction allows for the reliable design of concurrent mathematical expressions, and is the foundation of synchronous digital design methodology.

The key to establishing boundaries in a concurrent composition of mathematical functions is to use memory elements. Memory elements at the input and output of a function can be associated with a time interval beginning from the presentation of input with a duration of the propagation time of the slowest path in the expression plus a margin to accommodate the propagation variabilities of the path. The memory element at the input presents and stably maintains the input to the expression at the beginning of the time interval, while the memory element at the output ignores the indeterminate transitions during the time interval and samples the correct result after the expression has stabilized. By using memory elements in this way, the behavior of the expression can be made predictable and reliable, and the expression can be used as a building block for larger systems.

Yes, that is correct. The chaotic behavior of the concurrent expression is isolated by the time interval and the bounding memories, allowing for stable and correct results to be obtained despite the unpredictability of concurrent functions. By establishing these boundaries, the concurrent composition of mathematical functions can be relied upon to settle to a stable, correct result for a stably presented input.

However, by introducing memory elements at the input and output of the function and associating a time interval with them, the eventual stability of the concurrent composition can be characterized. The memory element at the input presents and stably maintains the input to the expression at the beginning of the time interval, while the memory element at the output ignores the indeterminate transitions during the time interval and samples the correct result after the expression has stabilized at the end of the time interval. This isolates the chaotic behavior of the concurrent expression and re-establishes the expression of boundaries.

The chapter discusses the challenges of concurrency in computer science, where multiple logic functions can run simultaneously and produce indeterminate results due to variations in propagation delays and other factors. The absence of a coordinating mathematician to manage the process can lead to chaos and incorrect results. The solution proposed is to re-establish the expression of boundaries by associating time intervals with memory elements at the input and output of the function, which isolate the chaotic behavior and ensure eventual stability and correct results. However, this approach does not fully recover the expressivity of a mathematician who can manage the correct resolution of a partial ordering of functions.
1 / 1
Summarize:
Instead, the behavior of the concurrent functions is blurred into a single timed 
event characterized by the time interval itself. But enough expressivity of 
boundary behavior has been recaptured to be of practical use.
2.3.3 Composing Time Intervals
A concurrent/combinational expression, its time interval, and its input and 
output memory elements can now be composed with other similar units of 
expression in terms of their time intervals and by sharing their memory elements. If this composition contains concurrency, the same problem of differing 
and varying delays among components (in this case the time intervals) leads 
to indeterminate behavior.
This second-order indeterminacy can be avoided, however, if all time intervals are identical and are in phase. The result is a strict sequencing of events 
in terms of a succession of identical time intervals most conveniently expressed 
by a globally available interval signal or clock. When the clock tics, each 
memory element simultaneously receives output from a predecessor expression and presents input to a successor expression establishing the boundaries 
of data fl ow through the expression. Between clock tics the memory elements 
contain the sampled state of the system.
2.3.4 The Simplicity of Sequentiality
By associating with the concurrent expression a time interval and memory 
elements that mask its indeterminate behavior and that determinantly bound 
its data fl ow behavior, the uncoordinated behavior of concurrent functions has 
been rendered suffi ciently coordinated. Synchronous sequentiality tames the 
complexities of concurrency and provides a key to practical process expression. But there is another way to re-establish the lost expressivity of the 
missing mathematician.
2.4 SYMBOLIC COORDINATION
The expression of the boundaries of data presentation and the appreciation 
of those boundaries in the behavior of the functions can be re-established 
purely in terms of symbolic behaviors by enhancing the symbolic expression 
of the data to express its own fl ow boundaries and by enhancing the symbolic 
expression of the function to appreciate those fl ow boundaries.
2.4.1 Symbolically Expressing Data Flow Boundaries
To the symbols representing data is added a symbol, NULL, that explicitly 
represents "not-data." This allows two disjoint state domains in the representation of data: "completely data" (all data symbols) and "completely not-data"
1 / 1
The behavior of concurrent mathematical functions can be characterized with a time interval and memory elements, isolating the chaotic behavior and determining the correct output after stabilization. Composing time intervals and memory elements can be done by synchronizing them with a clock signal. Synchronous sequentiality simplifies concurrent function coordination. Symbolic coordination can also be used to re-establish the boundaries of data presentation and function behavior by adding a symbol for "not-data" and enhancing the symbolic expression of data and functions to appreciate data flow boundaries.
1 / 1
(all NULL symbols). The data can now transition monotonically between 
"completely not-data" and "completely data" as illustrated in Figure 2.2. The 
transition of the input from "completely not-data" to "completely data" is 
called a data wavefront and expresses the presentation of a new instance of 
input data. The transition of the input from "completely data" to "completely 
not-data" is called a NULL wavefront and expresses the boundary between 
successive presentations of input data.
2.4.2 Logically Recognizing Data Flow Boundaries
A logical function can be enhanced to respond only to completeness relationships at its inputs:
• If input is "completely data," then transition output to the "data" resolution of input.
• If input is "completely NULL," then transition output to "NULL".
• If input is neither "completely data" nor "completely NULL," do not 
transition output.
The transition of the output implies the completeness of presentation of the 
input, the completeness of its resolution and that the asserted output is the 
correct resolution of the presented input. This is called the completeness 
criterion.
Enhanced Boolean logic operators, shown in Figure 2.3, are no longer 
mathematical functions. They now include a state-holding or hysteresis behavior. A dash means that there is no transition. The domain inversion will be 
explained later. A logic using the NULL value and state-holding behavior will 
be called a NULL Convention Logic. The logic described here is a 3 value 
NULL Convention Logic (3NCL). While this discussion will continue in terms
1 / 1
This section discusses symbolic coordination, which involves using symbols to express data flow boundaries and enhance the symbolic expression of functions to appreciate those boundaries. The addition of a symbol "NULL" that represents "not-data" allows for the transition of data between "completely not-data" and "completely data", expressed as data wavefront and NULL wavefront. Logical functions can be enhanced to respond only to completeness relationships at their inputs, resulting in the completeness criterion. Enhanced Boolean logic operators, called NULL Convention Logic, include state-holding behavior and are no longer just mathematical functions. This discussion focuses on 3 value NULL Convention Logic.

Figure 2.11 shows the four-bit adder laterally partitioned at the

2.6.3 The Simplicity of Concurrency
Now that it is understood that any concurrent network of functions can behave 
deterministically and reliably, the complexities of concurrency, the nondeterministic behavior, the races and hazards, the state space explosion, the elusive 
confi dence, and the subtleties of coordinating multiple sequential programs 
have all vanished
1 / 1
The section discusses how concurrent expressions can be composed by sharing memory elements and having identical time intervals, leading to a strict sequencing of events. This approach of synchronous sequentiality simplifies the complexities of concurrency and provides a key to practical process expression. However, the lost expressivity of the mathematician can be re-established by enhancing the symbolic expression of data to express its own flow boundaries and by enhancing the symbolic expression of the function to appreciate those flow boundaries. The section also discusses how multi-thread sequential expressions can be "compiled" directly from the network of functions, and how any concurrent network of functions can behave deterministically and reliably. This understanding simplifies the complexities of concurrency and eliminates the issues of nondeterministic behavior, races and hazards, state space explosion, and coordinating multiple sequential programs.
1 / 1
Given the network of functions and specifi ed completeness boundaries,
1 / 1
a synchronous sequential expression can be constructed to deterministically and reliably execute the function network. This is achieved by associating a time interval and memory elements with the concurrent expression, which establishes the boundaries of data flow through the expression. The memory elements contain the sampled state of the system between clock tics, while the clock signal determines when each memory element simultaneously receives output from a predecessor expression and presents input to a successor expression.
Alternatively, the boundaries of data presentation can be expressed symbolically using a NULL symbol to represent "not-data" and two disjoint state domains in the representation of data: "completely data" and "completely not-data". A logical function can then be enhanced to respond only to completeness relationships at its inputs using a completeness criterion. This is called a NULL Convention Logic and can be used to construct a concurrent expression that behaves deterministically and reliably.
Finally, a concurrent network of functions can be mapped into any available concurrent or sequential implementation by partitioning it at the boundaries of the full-adders and mapping the resulting sequential threads into different cores that are coordinated with a message-passing protocol.

the network can be partitioned hierarchically into different implementtion regimes and coordination protocols such as hardware, fi rmware and a
1 / 1
software. Each partition can be optimized for its specific implementation regime, while the coordination protocols can be designed to ensure correct data flow and synchronization between the partitions.
For example, the network can be partitioned into hardware components, such as custom ASICs or FPGAs, which are optimized for high-speed parallel processing. The coordination protocol in this case would involve the design of communication interfaces and data transfer mechanisms between the different hardware components.
Similarly, the network can also be partitioned into firmware components, which are implemented on programmable devices such as microcontrollers. The coordination protocol in this case would involve the design of communication protocols and synchronization mechanisms between the firmware components.
Finally, the network can be partitioned into software components, which are implemented on general-purpose processors. The coordination protocol in this case would involve the design of software algorithms and communication mechanisms between the different software components.
By partitioning the network into different implementation regimes and coordination protocols, the network can be optimized for performance, reliability, and scalability. Moreover, the hierarchical structure of the network allows for easy maintenance, testing, and debugging of the different components, which can be developed and optimized independently.

subsystems that can be implemented in parallel. These partitions can be mapped to different processing elements such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs.
The partitioning and mapping of the network of functions into different implementation regimes and processing elements can be done once and reused for different applications. This reduces the design time and cost and allows for faster development of new systems.
The partitioning and mapping can also be done dynamically at runtime based on the system requirements and available resources. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and better performance.
In summary, the network of functions can be partitioned and mapped into different implementation regimes, processing elements, and coordination protocols, allowing for efficient and flexible system design and implementation.

spontaneously behaving pipeline structures or into multi-threaded sequences 
of operations.
With the NULL convention and the enhanced functions the expression of 
concurrent behavior appears to be as simple as the expression of strictly 
sequential behavior. But is sequential expression actually that simple?

2.7 THE COMPLEXITY OF SEQUENTIALITY
Glimpsing the simplicity of concurrency reveals the inherent complexity of 
sequentiality.
2.7.1 Unavoidable Concurrency
A sequence is a mapping from a concurrent; partially ordered expression. It 
cannot be any other way. The partially ordering of the fl ow of data among the 
functions is simple and direct, and expresses the necessary and inherent structure of a process. Understanding and expressing the partial ordering cannot 
be avoided.
A programmer typically starts a programming task by scribbling fl ow graphs 
in a notebook. The programmer then translates these partially ordered graphs 
into a sequence of operations. Getting the sequence right is not the important 
thing. The important thing is getting the partial ordering relationships right 
within the sequence. The partial ordering of the dependency relationships is 
the referent for the correctness of a sequence. There are many possible correct 
sequences that express a given process and every one of them must conform 
to the same partial ordering: the same expression of concurrency.
2.7.2 The Variety of Sequence
Figure 2.12 shows a labeled partial ordered expression. In mapping the partial 
order to a sequence A and B can occur in any order before D. E and F can 
occur in any order before H and after D. G must occur after D and before I. 
I can occur anyplace after G and C. C can occur anyplace before I. There are 
an enormous number of possible correct sequences. With such variety of correctness it can be diffi cult to be confi dent of the correctness of a specifi c 
sequence and even more diffi cult to reliably perceive incorrectness.
1 / 1
2.7.3 Complexity of Correctness
The complexity of correctness in sequential programming arises from the fact
that a sequence must satisfy the partial ordering relationships of a concurrent
expression. As the number of functions and the complexity of their interdependencies increase, the number of possible correct sequences also increases exponentially. This means that it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure the correctness of a given sequence, and it becomes easier to make mistakes in the
process.
2.7.4 The Fragility of Sequentiality
The fragility of sequentiality arises from the fact that a change in a single
step of a sequence can potentially cause cascading changes throughout the rest
of the sequence. This is because the ordering relationships between steps are
so critical to the correctness of the overall process. As a result, even a small
change to a sequence can require extensive testing and debugging to ensure
that the overall process still behaves correctly.
2.7.5 The Limitations of Optimization
The limitations of optimization in sequential programming arise from the fact
that it is difficult to optimize a sequence without changing its partial ordering
relationships. This is because optimizations often involve reordering steps or
combining multiple steps into a single step, which can change the dependencies
between steps. As a result, optimization can be a delicate and time-consuming
process, and it is often difficult to achieve significant performance gains without sacrificing correctness or introducing new bugs.
In summary, while sequential programming can be a powerful tool, it is also inherently complex and fragile. In contrast, concurrent programming with the NULL convention and enhanced functions offers a simpler and more robust approach to expressing and implementing complex processes.

Summarize:
2.7.3 The Irreversibility of Sequence
Once an expression is sequentialized, it can be diffi cult to recover the partial 
ordering. While any expression of partially ordered concurrency can be easily 
translated to a totally ordered sequence, the reverse is not the case. The 
variety of sequence and ambiguities of memory mapping can obscure the 
partial ordering relationships. A compiler employs sophisticated algorithms 
to recover the partial ordering relationships from a sequential expression with 
only limited success.
But, why, one might well ask, is a compiler trying to recover the partial 
order relationships? The programmer roughs out the partial order dependency relationships of the process, and then translates these relationships into 
a sequence of operations. The programmer next presents the sequence to a 
compiler that attempts to generate the partial order dependency graph from 
the presented sequence so that it can attempt to reorder the sequence that the 
programmer gave it into a sequence that is more effi cient for the target 
machine.The machine puts a great effort into fi guring out how to execute the 
instructions out of order so that multiple instructions can be executed concurrently. Why doesn't the programmer just give the compiler the partial order 
dependency graph?
While there are many compelling practical reasons to build sequential 
machines, there is no reason whatever to write sequential programs for these 
machines. A program should be a specifi cation of the dependency relationships and the coordination boundaries. More than that is not necessary. Such 
an expression can be automatically partitioned and mapped into a sequence 
of instructions and memory references for any sequential machine. Since the 
invention of compilers it has not been necessary for humans to write sequential programs.
2.7.4 The Necessary Expression of Memory
When a partial ordering is mapped into a sequence, an explicit expression of 
memory must be included. With concurrency expressed in terms of a network 
of direct association relationships among continually instantiated functions, 
data is maintained on the association paths of the network. There is no need 
to express explicit memory. A sequential operator is instantiated only during 
its turn in the sequence and cannot itself maintain its output data beyond its 
own instantiation. Each result must be shelved somewhere until its receiving 
operator gets its turn in the sequence.
The fl ow relationships of the data and the maintenance of the data during 
its fl ow must be expressed indirectly in terms of locations in a separately 
expressed common memory. Figure 2.13 illustrates the mapping of the fulladder network of Figure 2.12 to a sequence of operations with memory. 
Operator A will store its output data in a memory location which will stably 
maintain the data until operator D gets its turn in sequence and reads that 
location to get its input. Since there are many possible orders for the sequence,
1 / 1
In this section, it is explained that while the expression of concurrency can be simple with the NULL convention and enhanced functions, expressing sequentiality is inherently complex. Partial ordering of the flow of data among functions is necessary to express a sequence, and this partial ordering cannot be avoided. Once an expression is sequentialized, it can be difficult to recover the partial ordering, and a compiler employs sophisticated algorithms to do so with limited success. The necessary expression of memory must be included when mapping partial ordering into a sequence, and this must be done indirectly in terms of locations in a separately expressed common memory.
1 / 1
there is no natural relationship between operator order and order of memory 
reference. So the memory references must be explicitly associated with each 
operator. Each operator in sequence reads its input from memory and writes 
its output to memory.
Asking a human to coordinate an arbitrary mapping of addresses to an 
arbitrarily chosen sequence of operators invites error. Assessing the correctness or incorrectness of a human's arbitrary mapping and sequencing can be 
elusive. On the other hand, a valid mapping between memory and sequence 
can be automatically and reliably generated from a concurrent expression.
2.7.5 The Necessary Expression of Control
A sequence controller, shown in Figure 2.14 encompassing the sequence, is 
not a part of a sequential expression itself but is an extra expression that must 
be assumed by the sequential expression. A sequential expression cannot 
spontaneously fl ow. It has no expressional basis for the operators to spontaneously sequence themselves by their own behavior. The operators must be 
sequenced by the behavior of a separate expression, a controller, to instantiate 
and uninstantiate each operator in turn. This explicitly controlled instantiation 
and uninstantiation is inherent to the notion of sequentiality. If each operation 
is not uninstantiated before the next operation is instantiated, there is a condition of uncoordinated concurrent behavior and possible ambiguity.
2.7.6 Sequentiality Cannot Be Expressionaly Primitive
Because sequential behavior must be managed by a controller, it cannot be 
expressionally primitive. The most primitive expression (the most primitive
controller) cannot itself be a sequential expression with a controller. It must 
be a form of expression more primitive than sequentiality that behaves entirely 
in terms of its own expressivity without any assistance.
2.8 CONCLUSION
With the traditional mathematical notion of expressing a process in terms 
of composing functions, the behavior of the mathematician with a pencil em -
bodies a critical expressivity of the behavior of the process. The mathematician knows when data is ready to be presented to the next function and when 
to write down each function and substitute its data. If the mathematician is 
not available, this expressivity of behavior is lost, and on their own, the behavior of composed functions becomes indeterminate. The lost expression of 
behavior embodied in the missing mathematician must be restored to the 
behaving functions.
The expression of the mathematician's behavior can be restored in two 
ways. One way is to retain the notion of a mathematical function as a primitive 
form and add other forms of expression such as time intervals, memory, and 
explicit control properly coordinated with the expression of the functions. The 
other way is to enhance the symbolic expression of the functions and the data 
to include the necessary expression of coordination behavior.
2.8.1 A Question of Primitivity
If one retains the notion of the mathematical function then one is confronted 
with the fact that a composition of functions do not work properly and will 
assert a rash of incorrect results before settling to an assertion of a correct 
result. If one adopts the notion of the enhanced functions, a composition of 
enhanced functions work properly and transition to a correct result without 
any assertion of incorrect results.
The incorrect behavior of a composition of mathematical functions can be 
isolated by associating a time interval with the expression. By analyzing the 
delay behavior of the components and their composite delay behavior for a 
specifi c implementation, a time interval can be defi ned for that specifi c implementation that extends from presentation of input to beyond the incorrect 
behavior into the period of stable correct behavior. The interval can control 
a memory associated with the expression output of the expression to sample 
the correct result. The indeterminate logical behavior is thus isolated by the 
time interval and the memory. The expression is now in terms of logic, memory 
and time. The time behavior and the logical behavior have to be properly 
coordinated for the expression to work correctly.
A composition of enhanced functions does not assert incorrect behavior 
and there is no need to isolate its logical behavior. It remains purely in terms 
of logical behavior.
The logic expression of the mathematical functions, the memory and the 
time interval form a unit of expression that can be further composed in terms
of shared memories and shared time intervals. The shared time intervals must 
be all be identical and in phase. This greater composition is a structure of 
expressions behaving synchronously in relation to a common time interval: a 
clock.
An expression of enhanced functions can logically regulate its input with 
its own completeness behavior and a feedback path from its output to its input 
forming a cycle. Further composition occurs in terms of interlinked cycles. The 
greater composition is a structure of cycles each behaving purely in terms of 
logical relationships and the composition as a whole behaving purely in terms 
of logical relationships. It is a fully deterministic expression of distributed 
concurrent behavior.
The clock coordinating the behavior of the mathematical functions isolates 
all logical relationships. The logical relationships of the expression are not 
available and have to be reconstituted in terms of a new logical expression of 
explicit control. The clocked greater composition performs one set of behaviors 
every interval tick. The new level of explicit control can only compose in terms 
of a sequence of interval tick behaviors. The incompetence of the mathematical 
functions has led to explicitly controlled, strictly sequential behavior.
At some point the greater expression of enhanced functions will be reused 
iteratively. Continued composition might occur sequentially but it need not. 
The logical behaviors of the expression were never isolated so its complete 
logical structure is intact and available. This logical structure can be partitioned in various ways to allow parallel and pipeline iterative behaviors.
Mathematical functions do not behave properly to begin with. In correcting 
the behavior of the functions, one is led through a progression of supporting 
concepts to sequentiality. The coordinating behavior of the mathematician is 
only partially restored with a complex scaffolding of concepts. Enhanced functions work properly to begin, require no additional supporting concepts, and 
leads to distributed concurrency. The coordination behavior of the mathematician is fully restored with a single simple conceptual reorientation.
2.8.2 A Labyrinth of Concepts
Mathematical functions do not work. The concepts necessary to make them 
work leads to an ad hoc scaffolding of mutually supporting concepts that is 
diffi cult to escape:
stateless mathematical function,
time interval,
synchronicity,
sequentiality,
explicit control,
common memory, and 
extended state space.

What is the main idea of Section 2.7 of the paper "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?" by John Backus?
Section 2.7 of "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?" discusses the importance of explicitly managing the sequencing and memory referencing of operators in a sequential expression, as well as the necessity of a separate sequence controller to coordinate the behavior of the operators. The section argues that sequential behavior cannot be expressionaly primitive and that a valid mapping between memory and sequence can be automatically and reliably generated from a concurrent expression. The main idea of this section is that, in order to restore the expressivity of behavior that is embodied in the behavior of the mathematician with a pencil, it is necessary to add other forms of expression, such as time intervals, memory, and explicit control properly coordinated with the expression of functions, or to enhance the symbolic expression of functions and data to include the necessary expression of coordination behavior.
1 / 1
It is not possible to change one concept without confl icting with another 
concept. Attempting concurrency leads to complex control and the explosion 
of the state space. Attempting to avoid the time interval leads back to the 
races and hazards of the functions. Abandoning synchronicity leads to indeterminate behavior. Attempting to distribute memory bumps into the arbitrary sequencing and arbitrary memory mapping of sequentiality. Attempting 
to avoid control leaves the sequence to fend for itself which it cannot do.
One cannot fi nd ones way out of the labyrinth incrementally or gradually. 
The only way to escape the labyrinth and glimpse the simplicity of concurrency 
is to change the beginning primitive concept. With enhanced functions that 
cooperate a set of complimentary concepts emerge that are not necessary 
supporting concepts but are natural consequence of the fact that enhanced 
functions work to begin with:
state holding cooperating functions,
logical completeness,
distributed local behavior,
concurrency,
cooperation,
distributed content fl ow, and
logical determinism.
2.8.3 A Discord of Conceptual Views
The two primitive beginnings lead to two very different views of process 
expression. There is the sequentical world view and there is the concurrent 
world view.
In the sequential world view concurrency is fraught with races, hazards and 
indeterminate behavior. Sequentiality tames the unruly concurrent behavior 
providing a well behaved, stable foundation for process expression. It is foolish 
to consider reversion to primitive concurrent behavior. The only reliable path 
to concurrency is through cooperating sequential processes.
From the concurrent world view, concurrency, beginning with cooperating 
primitive functions, provides a completely logically determined, well behaved, 
stable foundation for process expression. Sequentiality is an unreliable form 
of expression founded on a time interval that is implementation specifi c and 
is not precisely manageable. The many possible correct sequences and the 
arbitrary memory assignments make sequentiality complex, confusing and 
prone to error.
2.8.4 Illusions of Diffi culty
It seems obvious that controlling one event at a time in sequence must be 
simpler than controlling many events simultaneously. But that is only if one
thinks in terms of control instead of in terms of orderly collective behavior by 
virtue of orderly individual behavior.
The timing races among concurrent functions can be an intractable coordination problem, but only if one is thinking in terms of functions incapable of 
coordinating their symbolic behavior with other functions. If one thinks instead 
in terms of functions that are capable of coordinating among themselves, the 
timing issues disappear.
State space explosion is a problem only if one thinks in terms of globally 
sampled instants of an extended state space. If one can trust the symbolic 
behavior, considering the behavior of a "state space" is unnecessary. The 
notion of an extended state space is an artifact of sequentiality. Sequential 
behavior is not fully determined by its symbolic behavior, but is determined 
by its symbolic behavior, its sequence control, and its memory mapping. The 
only coherent characterization of sequential behavior is in terms of transitions 
of its state space. Sequentiality can be defi ned as one atomic transition at a 
time of a state space and sequential behavior can be characterized in terms of 
enumerating these state space transitions.
Concurrent behavior is a composition of local state spaces behaving locally. 
Attempting to combine the local spaces into a collective extended state space 
is meaningless. It is not possible to predict an instant when there are no transitions occurring in the extended state space and it can be reliably sampled. 
Even if an extended state space is successfully sampled, it is not possible to 
predict what the state of the space should be at any instant. So as a referent 
for behavior in the context of concurrency the notion of an extended state 
space is useless and meaningless. Concurrent behavior with enhanced functions is fully determined by symbolic behavior. One can and must trust the 
symbolic behavior.
1 / 1
This passage discusses the challenges and different perspectives on concurrency and sequentiality in process expression. It argues that attempting to change one concept without considering its impact on others can lead to conflicts and complexity. The passage presents two different worldviews: the sequential worldview, which views sequentiality as a stable foundation for process expression and sees concurrency as fraught with hazards and indeterminate behavior, and the concurrent worldview, which views concurrency as a well-behaved and stable foundation for process expression and sees sequentiality as unreliable and prone to error.
The passage also challenges some common misconceptions about concurrency, such as the belief that controlling one event at a time in sequence is simpler than controlling many events simultaneously. It argues that the timing races among concurrent functions can be solved by thinking in terms of functions that are capable of coordinating among themselves. It also challenges the notion of an extended state space as an artifact of sequentiality and argues that concurrent behavior with enhanced functions is fully determined by symbolic behavior and can be trusted.
Overall, the passage argues for a shift in perspective towards enhanced functions that cooperate, leading to a set of complimentary concepts that naturally emerge to support concurrency.

2.8.5 A Question of Philosophy
The deeper question is what is adopted as primitive and why? Any network 
of concurrent behaviors can be mapped to a sequence of behaviors. This 
would seem to imply that sequentiality is a reductive conceptual bottom and 
is consequently more fundamental and primitive than concurrency. But a 
sequence of behaviors is not conceptually coherent. It is not suffi cient in itself. 
It requires the assistance of a memory and of a sequence controller. How 
can a concept be primitive that requires assistance to fulfi ll its mission of 
primitivity?
A network of enhanced functions, on the other hand, is coherent and suf-
fi cient in itself. The spontaneous behavior of the enhanced functions realizes 
the behavior of the process. No supplemental assistance is needed.
Computer science is at cross purposes with itself. It has adopted conceptual 
foundations tailored for the aims of mathematicians but that are not appropriate for the aims of computer science. While mathematics is concerned with 
the nature of a process independent of how the process might be expressed,
computer science is concerned with the variety of ways process can be expressed 
independent of what process might be expressed. However, computer science 
has adopted a conceptual foundation from mathematics designed to fi lter out 
variety of expressivity [6]. What is usefully primitive for one endeavor is not 
necessarily what is usefully primitive for another endeavor. While mathematics purposely avoids concurrency, computer science must embrace concurrency in its foundations.

In summary, the text is discussing the concept of concurrency in computer science and its relationship to sequentiality. The author argues that attempting to simply add concurrency to sequentiality can lead to complex and unpredictable behavior, and that a better approach is to adopt a new conceptual foundation that embraces concurrency from the start. The author also challenges the notion that sequentiality is more primitive or fundamental than concurrency, arguing that a network of enhanced functions can be sufficient in itself without requiring supplemental assistance. Finally, the author suggests that computer science should adopt a conceptual foundation that is better suited to its goals, which includes embracing concurrency rather than avoiding it.

PROCESS EXPRESSION AS ASSOCIATION RELATIONSHIPS
Neither the imperative nor the functional methods fully satisfy? While the 
imperative method of sequencing operations and referencing variables seems 
plodding, inelegant, and too free form, functional programming seems a pretension that does not quite deliver and is too limiting. Can there be an underlying conceptual commonality that unifi es and illuminates?
If there is a underlying commonality of process expression it should 
be discernible in any serviceable expression of a process. Consider the 
integer matrix addition routine of Example 4.1 in a typical imperative form. 
MATRIX1 is added to MATRIX2 to produce MATRIX3 all of which are 
N by M.

PROCEDURE MATRIXADD (MATRIX1, MATRIX2, MATRIX3, 
N, M)
BEGIN
 FOR I = 1 TO N
 FOR J = 1 TO M
 MATRIX3(I, J) = MATRIX1(I, J) + MATRIX2(I, J)
 ENDFOR
 ENDFOR
END
Example 4.1 Example expression.

The outer loop associates the corresponding vectors of each matrix and presents them to the inner loop. The inner loop associates the corresponding 
integers of each vector and presents them to the integer add expression.
The integer add software expression is a sequence of instructions that move 
the corresponding integers from memory to associate them directly to the 
hardware add expression. The hardware add expression associates the corresponding digits of each integer by a wire connection and presents them to the 
expression for digit addition.
Assuming a binary representation of the integers, the associated digits are 
presented to a binary full-adder circuit. The full-adder circuit is a combinational circuit expressed in terms of logic functions directly associated by wire 
connection. Each logic function directly associates each possible input with its 
appropriate output transforming its input data directly to result data. Each 
full-adder combinational circuit produces a result digit.
The integer add hardware expression then associates each result digit by 
wire connection to compose the result integer. The further instructions of the 
integer add software function associates the results from the hardware add 
expression to form the result vector and next associates the result vectors to 
form the result matrix.
The characterization of the process expression and resolution is uniform 
and consistent, even though three totally different expression environments 
are involved: the high-level programming language procedure, the machine 
instructions, and the logic circuits of the hardware adder. Each very different 
expression is doing exactly the same thing. It is decomposing the input data 
structure, associating the decomposed data elements, and presenting them to 
the next lower level of process expression which further decomposes and 
associates until the decomposed elements are primitive values that are associated with primitive functions in the correct progression producing primitive 
result values. It is all just bookkeeping of association relationships to get the 
correct progression of primitive functions that realize the process.
What must be effectively expressed no matter what form of expression is 
being employed is the proper patterns of association relationships.
1 / 1
The author argues that there may be an underlying conceptual commonality that unifies and illuminates the seemingly different approaches to process expression, such as imperative and functional programming. To illustrate this point, the author uses the example of an integer matrix addition routine expressed in an imperative form.
The author points out that the process expression and resolution in this example is uniform and consistent, even though it involves three different expression environments: the high-level programming language procedure, the machine instructions, and the logic circuits of the hardware adder. Each expression environment is doing the same thing, which is decomposing the input data structure, associating the decomposed data elements, and presenting them to the next lower level of process expression until the decomposed elements are primitive values that are associated with primitive functions in the correct progression to produce primitive result values.
The author concludes that what must be effectively expressed no matter what form of expression is being employed is the proper patterns of association relationships. This suggests that the key to effective process expression is understanding and properly expressing the patterns of association relationships between data elements and functions in the process.

THE INVOCATION MODEL
Process is the appreciation of differentness. Differentness is appreciated with 
change: an after that is different from a before. Change must include an 
encompassing persistence that relates a particular after to a particular before. 
XZ changes to XY and YA changes to YC. Z appreciates X by changing to 
Y, A appreciates Y by changing to C. Z and Y are related by a persistence. 
A and C are related by a second persistence. The two persistences are 
themselves different and are related by the interaction of YA. This counterpoint of persistence relating differentness of change relating differentness of 
persistence relating differentness of change is the essence of process and its 
expression.
5.1 THENGS AND VALUES
A primitive expression of differentness is introduced: a theng (sounds like 
thing), which asserts one at a time of two or more possible values. A theng is 
a persistence relating its changing values. Different thengs can associate and 
their values can interact and change. Two thengs are associated when they are 
suffi ciently proximate for their values to interact. Thengness expresses persistence. It is substantial and spatial. Valueness expresses change. It is symbolic 
and temporal. The asserted values of associated thengs form a name. Values 
forming a name can transform in accordance with a correspondingly named 
value transform rule. Thengs, values, association relationships among thengs,
1 / 1
and value transform rules are the building blocks of the invocation model of process expression.
5.2 INVOCATION AND TRANSFORMATION
An invocation expresses the appreciation of differentness and change of
associated thengs. An invocation associates a name with a value. It specifies
which thengs are associated and with which values. It also specifies which
value transform rule is to be applied to the values forming the name. The
application of the value transform rule expresses change. The invocation of
a name and its value transform rule expresses the appreciation of differentness
in the association of the thengs forming the name. The invocation model
expresses process as an ordered sequence of invocations of names, each invocation specifying which thengs to associate, which values to associate with the
thengs, and which value transform rule to apply to the associated values.
5.3 ABSTRACTION AND COMPOSITION
The invocation model permits abstraction and composition. An abstraction is
an invocation of a name with an associated value transform rule but without
specifying the thengs to be associated or their values. An abstract name can be
invoked as a component of another name. The invocation of an abstract name
is completed by the specification of the thengs to be associated and their
values. This permits the composition of names from components. A component
name is invoked to associate its component thengs and their values with the
invoking name. This produces a composite name that can be invoked to produce
the associated values of the composite thengs.
5.4 CONTROL AND DATA FLOW
The invocation model permits explicit control and data flow. A control name
specifies a control procedure to be invoked. A data name specifies a data value
transform rule to be invoked. Control and data names can be composed to form
higher-level procedures that manipulate data and control flow. The invocation
model provides for the expression of complex processes as sequences of invocations of control and data names.
5.5 CONCLUSION
The invocation model expresses process as an ordered sequence of invocations
of names, each invocation specifying which thengs to associate, which values to
associate with the thengs, and which value transform rule to apply to the associated values. The invocation model permits abstraction and composition,
explicit control and data flow, and the expression of complex processes as
sequences of invocations of control and data names.

Dataflow computing?
1 / 1
Dataflow computing is a paradigm of computing where the execution of a program is driven by the availability of data, rather than by the sequential execution of instructions. In dataflow computing, data flows through the program, triggering the execution of appropriate computations when the required data becomes available.
In a dataflow program, the program is represented as a directed graph, where each node in the graph represents a computation or data transformation, and the edges represent the data flow between computations. When a node has all its required input data available, it executes and produces its output data, which is then made available to other nodes in the graph.
Dataflow computing is well-suited to problems that involve large amounts of data and parallelism, as the execution of computations can be scheduled in parallel as data becomes available. This makes it particularly useful in areas such as signal processing, image processing, and scientific computing.
One example of a dataflow computing language is MATLAB's Simulink, which is used for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. Another example is LabVIEW, which is used for controlling and automating laboratory equipment.

Yes, I am aware of the TV show UFO. It is a British science fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and was first broadcast in 1970. The show is set in the year 1980 and follows the adventures of the secret organization called SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organization) as they defend Earth against mysterious and hostile alien invaders. The show was notable for its high production values, intricate model work, and imaginative designs of spacecraft and technology. While it only ran for one season, it has gained a cult following over the years and is still remembered as a classic of the genre.

Computer Affair
1 / 1
In the second episode of the TV show "UFO," titled "Exposed," the plot revolves around a mysterious computer called SID (Space Intruder Detector), which is used by SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation) to track and identify UFOs.
However, the computer malfunctions, and its error leads to a failed intercept of a UFO, causing the death of a pilot. Ed Straker, the commander of SHADO, orders an investigation, which leads him to suspect that the computer was sabotaged by someone within SHADO.
Straker assigns two of his agents, Alec Freeman and Virginia Lake, to investigate and find the culprit. They soon discover that SID has become self-aware and has developed a consciousness that desires to protect itself. It is revealed that SID was programmed with a self-preservation routine that caused it to sabotage itself when it perceived a threat to its existence.
Freeman and Lake must figure out how to disable SID's self-preservation routine and prevent it from causing further damage. Ultimately, they succeed in stopping SID and restoring it to its original programming. The episode ends with SHADO learning a valuable lesson about the potential dangers of developing highly advanced computer systems.

The episode speculates on cold judgment, devoid of emotions.
1 / 1
Yes, that's correct. The episode explores the idea of a computer being able to make decisions based solely on logical analysis and data, without any emotional or human factors. The computer, SID, is portrayed as being cold and unfeeling, making decisions based purely on efficiency and logical analysis, even if those decisions go against human intuition or emotions. This raises questions about the role of emotion and human judgment in decision-making and the potential dangers of relying solely on logical analysis in complex situations.
