I would turn on the TV, but it's so embarrassing to see all the other people, I don't know what they mean
And it was magic at first, when they spoke without sound
But now this world is gonna hurt, you better turn that thing down, turn it around
Well it wasn't me, says the boy with the gun, sure I pulled the trigger
But I needed to be done, because life's been killing me ever since it begun
You can't blame me, cause I'm too young
You can't blame me, sure the killer was my son, but I didn't teach him to pull the trigger of the gun
Killing on this TV screen, you can't blame me, it's those images you see
Well, you can't blame me, says the media man, well I wasn't the one who came up with the plan
And I just pulled my camera, what the people wanna see, man it's a two way mirror and you can't blame me
You can't blame me, says the singer of the song, or the maker of the movie, would you base his life on
It's only entertainment, as anyone can see, I smoke machines and make a man, you can fool me
It was you, it was me, it was every man, we've all got the blood on our hands
We only receive what we demand, and if we want hell, then hell's what we'll have
And I would turn on the TV, but it's so embarrassing, to see all the other people
Don't even know what they mean, and it was magic at first, but it lands everyone down
And now this world is gonna hurt, you better turn it around
Turn it around
