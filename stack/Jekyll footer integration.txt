</div>

To add a custom footer like:
html
Copiar c��digo
<
div
id
=
"footer"
>
  This page is open source and can be found
<
a
href
=
"https://github.com/standardgalactic/turnstile"
>here
</
a
>.
</
div

to a GitHub Pages site built with Jekyll, you'll want to
edit the layout
Jekyll uses to generate your pages.
������� Here's how to do it:
Create a
_layouts
directory
(if it doesn't exist already) in the root of your repository.
Inside that, create or edit the
default.html
file. This is the main layout Jekyll uses by default.
In
default.html
, locate where you'd like the footer to appear (typically at the bottom, after
{{ content }}
), and insert your HTML.
Example
_layouts/default.html
html
Copiar c��digo
<!DOCTYPE
html
>
<
html
lang
=
"en"
>
<
head
>
<
meta
charset
=
"UTF-8"
>
<
title
>{{ page.title }}
</
title
>
</
head
>
<
body
>
<
main
>
      {{ content }}
</
main
>
<
div
id
=
"footer"
>
      This page is open source and can be found
<
a
href
=
"https://github.com/standardgalactic/turnstile"
>here
</
a
>.
</
div
>
</
body
>
</
html

��� Next Steps
Make sure your pages (like
index.md
or
README.md
if used as homepage) have this at the top:
yaml
Copiar c��digo
---
layout:
default
---
If you're using the
README.md
as your site homepage via
index.md
or
index.html
, and not using custom layouts yet, you might want to create one to get control over the full page structure.
��� Bonus (Styling)
Add a
_sass
directory and some CSS, or inline styles, to style your footer nicely.
Let me know if you want help styling it or if you're using a theme like
jekyll-theme-minimal
or
jekyll-theme-cayman
���those require a slightly different approach.
