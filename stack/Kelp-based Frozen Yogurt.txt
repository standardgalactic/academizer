Isn't laminated safety glass used in pretty much all windshields today?

ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. Today, laminated safety glass is widely used in automobile windshields. The lamination process involves sandwiching a layer of plastic, usually polyvinyl butyral (PVB), between two layers of glass. This structure provides enhanced safety as it is designed to hold together when shattered, preventing the glass from breaking into large, sharp, and potentially dangerous pieces. The windshield thus maintains some structural integrity even after damage, which can protect the occupants of the vehicle in case of accidents.

Frank Shuman was indeed an influential figure in the development of solar technology and sustainable energy. Born on January 23, 1862, Shuman was a prominent American inventor, engineer, and pioneer in solar energy. He is notably known for his groundbreaking work on solar engines. These innovative machines were designed to harness the power of the sun to heat water, thereby producing steam which could then be used to drive machinery. Despite the many other accomplishments to his name, Shuman's legacy is often most closely tied to these early efforts in harnessing solar power. His work laid a foundation for later developments in the field of renewable energy. Shuman passed away on April 28, 1918.

On August 20, 1897, Shuman invented a solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto one-foot square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and containing black pipes on the inside, which in turn powered a toy steam engine. The tiny steam engine operated continuously for over two years on sunny days next to a pond at the Shuman house.

In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Shine Power Company with the intent to build larger power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys,[citation needed] developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity so much that water could now be used instead of ether. He also developed a low-pressure steam turbine, since most 1910 vintage steam engines were built for steam and not sun-heated water. Shuman's turbine processed energy four times faster than any engine of his day. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine that was powered by low-pressure steam, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912. Scientific American again featured Shuman in its issues of February 4, 1911, and September 30, 1911.

Frank Shuman was a true pioneer in solar energy development. On August 20, 1897, he invented a solar engine that used mirrors to reflect sunlight onto one-foot square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water. Inside these boxes were black pipes, which, when heated, powered a small steam engine. This engine operated for over two years on sunny days at his home, demonstrating the potential of solar energy.
In 1908, Shuman founded the Sun Shine Power Company with the aim of constructing larger-scale power plants. Together with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, he refined his solar engine design. They developed a system that used mirrors to reflect sunlight onto collector boxes, significantly increasing the heat generated to the point where water, rather than ether, could be used.
Recognizing that most steam engines of his era (around 1910) were not designed for the low-pressure steam produced by his sun-heated water, Shuman also developed a low-pressure steam turbine. Remarkably, this turbine could process energy four times faster than any other engine of his time.
By 1912, Shuman had built a full-scale steam engine powered by his low-pressure steam system, which enabled him to patent the entire solar engine system. His work was recognized in two issues of Scientific American in 1911, further cementing his place as an innovator in the field of solar energy.

Shuman built the world���s first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt (1912-1913). Shuman���s plant used semi circle shaped troughs to power a 60-70 horsepower engine that pumped 6,000 gallons of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. His system included a number of technological improvements, including absorption plates with dual panes separated by a one-inch air space. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman���s vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.[5]

Early life
Boys was the eighth child of the Reverend Charles Boys, the Anglican vicar of Wing, Rutland. He was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal School of Mines, where he learned physics from Frederick Guthrie and taught himself higher mathematics while completing a degree in mining and metallurgy. As a student at the School of Mines he invented a mechanical device (which he called the "integraph") for plotting the integral of a function. He worked briefly in the coal industry before accepting Guthrie's offer of a position as "demonstrator."

Experimental physics
Boys achieved recognition as a scientist for his invention of the fused quartz fibre torsion balance, which allowed him to measure extremely small forces. He made the fused quartz fibres for his instrument by attaching a quartz rod to a crossbow quarrel, heating the rod to the point of melting, and shooting the crossbow. By this means he produced fibre so thin that it could not be resolved with an optical microscope.[2]

Boys used the quartz fibre torsion balance to produce a radiomicrometer capable of responding to the light of a single candle more than one mile away, and used that device for astronomical observations. He then used that same balance to improve upon Cavendish's measurement of the gravitational constant G. Boys published his measurement of G in 1894. His method was based on the same basic setup as Cavendish's, but with two masses suspended at one height and two nearby masses suspended at a different height, in order to minimise the unwanted interaction between opposite masses.[4]

Boys was a critic of the solar engine design of Frank Shuman, which led to Shuman hiring him as a technical consultant. Together they patented a "Sun-Boiler", which is similar to modern day parabolic trough solar power plants.[5]

He also worked on high-speed photography and invented a device (the "Boys camera") that allowed him to observe in some detail what occurs during a lightning strike.[6] According to the Feynman Lectures,

The first evidence of what happens in a lightning stroke was obtained in photographs taken with a camera held by hand and moved back and forth with the shutter open���while pointed toward a place where lightning was expected. The first photographs obtained this way showed clearly that lightning strokes are usually multiple discharges along the same path. Later, the "Boys" camera, which has two lenses mounted 180�� apart on a rapidly rotating disc, was developed. The image made by each lens moves across the film���the picture is spread out in time. If, for instance, the stroke repeats, there will be two images side by side. By comparing the images of the two lenses, it is possible to work out the details of the time sequence of the flashes.

The Man Who Invented VR Goggles 50 Years Too Soon Hugo Gernsback believed millions yearned for his 3D TV eyeglassesEVAN ACKERMAN30 NOV 20162 MIN READ

Science fiction as we know it would not exist without Hugo Gernsback. He coined the term ���science fiction��� as the editor and publisher of Amazing Stories, the first magazine devoted to the burgeoning genre, which he launched in 1926. The Hugo Awards for science fiction and fantasy are named after him.

Gernsback was also an inventor whose many ideas included a ���combined electric hair brush and comb,��� a battery-powered handheld illuminated mirror, and a wax-impregnated fabric strip for removing excess hair. But his most arresting invention was probably his television eyeglasses [above]. A Life magazine profile of Gernsback in July 1963, when he was 78, described his ���teleyeglasses���:

He now invents only in broad outline, leaving the actual mechanics of the thing to others. His television eyeglasses���a device for which he feels millions yearn���constitute a case in point. When the idea for this handy, pocket-size portable TV set occurred to him in 1936, he was forced to dismiss it as impractical. But a few weeks ago, feeling that the electronics industry was catching up with his New Deal-era concepts, he orders some of his employees to build a mock-up.
The teleyeglasses weighed about 140 grams and were built around small cathode-ray tubes that ran on low-voltage current from tiny batteries. (The user faced no danger of being electrocuted, Gernsback promised.) Because there was a separate screen for each eye, it could display stereoscopic images���much like today���s 3D virtual-reality glasses. Noting the massive V-type antenna protruding from the teleyeglasses, Life described the effect as ���neo-Martian.��� To be fair, modern VR goggles are only slightly less geeky looking than Gernsback���s.

Over his long life, Gernsback promoted many other futuristic ideas that have since become a reality: radar, microfilm, telemedicine, computer matchmaking, wireless spectrum regulation, bone-conduction hearing aids, tape recorders, electronic newspapers, and personal health trackers. The world is still waiting on some of his notions, though, including lunar mining, orbital mirror arrays, and the teleportation of ham sandwiches.

Hugo Gernsback, recognized as the father of science fiction and namesake for the Hugo Awards, was an inventor whose foresight extended far beyond his literary work. His groundbreaking ideas, such as a "combined electric hair brush and comb," a battery-powered handheld illuminated mirror, and a wax-impregnated fabric strip for removing excess hair, were just the tip of the iceberg.
His most remarkable invention, the teleyeglasses, are viewed as the precursor to modern-day VR (Virtual Reality) goggles. Conceived in 1936, Gernsback's idea for a handy, portable TV set that you could wear on your face was unfortunately deemed impractical at the time due to the state of electronic technology.
However, in 1963, with the electronics industry catching up with his New Deal-era concept, he had his employees construct a prototype. The teleyeglasses, which weighed around 140 grams, utilized small cathode-ray tubes powered by tiny batteries and boasted a separate screen for each eye, enabling them to display stereoscopic images, much like today's 3D VR glasses.
Gernsback's portfolio of visionary concepts included radar, microfilm, telemedicine, computer matchmaking, wireless spectrum regulation, bone-conduction hearing aids, tape recorders, electronic newspapers, and personal health trackers ��� many of which have now become an everyday reality.
Though Gernsback passed away, many of his more ambitious ideas like lunar mining, orbital mirror arrays, and the teleportation of ham sandwiches are still awaiting realization. His work and predictions continue to influence and inspire the fields of technology and science fiction to this day.
The original article discussing Gernsback's contributions and inventions was published in the December 2016 print issue of IEEE Spectrum, under the title "Before Virtual Reality Was Cool."

Nancy Johnson
indeed holds an important place in culinary history for her invention of the hand-cranked ice cream maker. This invention made it possible for people to make ice cream at home, and it was a huge step forward in making ice cream widely available.
Before Johnson's invention, ice cream was a luxury that was typically only available to the wealthy. It was a labor-intensive process that involved manual stirring of the ingredients in an ice-salt mixture until it solidified. This process was not only time-consuming but also required a certain skill to achieve the right texture.
In 1843, Nancy Johnson revolutionized this process by inventing and patenting a hand-cranked device that made the production of ice cream much easier and more efficient. Her ice cream maker used a pewter cylinder, with a lid that could be sealed tightly. Inside the cylinder, a paddle was attached to a crank. When the crank was turned, the paddle stirred the ice cream mixture. The cylinder was then placed in a wooden bucket, which was filled with crushed ice and salt to freeze the mixture.
While the basic design of ice cream makers has evolved over time, the principle behind Johnson's design remains in use today. Modern ice cream makers still use a similar system of a sealed container with a churn, placed inside a freezing environment.
Despite the significant impact of her invention, not much is known about Nancy Johnson's life. However, her contribution to ice cream making technology has certainly made summer days much more enjoyable for many people around the world!

Here's What Happened To Wake N' Bacon After Shark Tank
Thomas Quack/Shutterstock
BY ADAM VOSDING/UPDATED: SEPT. 6, 2022 9:51 AM EST
Do you ever find yourself wondering what happened to the various products that have been pitched on "Shark Tank?" According to The Hustle, from the inception of the show through the year 2019, 499 of the 895 products pitched on the show received an investment from one or more of the sharks. This 56% success rate also means that almost half of the entrepreneurs who appeared on the show through the year 2019 left without a deal. This is true for such hopefuls as Luma Soda, which fizzled after "Shark Tank," and Uprising Bread, which rose without the sharks.

In Season 2, Episode 2 of "Shark Tank" (via Shark Tank Tales), entrepreneur Matty Sallin took the stage to present his idea of an alarm clock that doubled as an oven to heat your morning bacon, having it hot and ready for you to eat when the time comes, per the Shark Tank Blog. Sallin called this device the Wake N' Bacon and was confident enough in his product that he asked for $40,000 for a 20% stake in his company. 

There are many ways to cook bacon, but is cooking bacon inside of an alarm clock something people would take to heart? Sallin was selling the product on the convenience factor, but one could also argue there was a cuteness factor, with its pig-shaped design.

The Wake N' Bacon raised safety concerns
ABC/YouTube
The pig-shaped Wake N' Bacon alarm clock was designed with an interior chamber that would heat two to three slices of pre-cooked bacon prior to the alarm going off. A YouTube video by Watch Mojo says the bacon would have to be placed in the chamber before the user goes to bed, which means the bacon would be left sitting without any refrigeration for several hours. As the clip points out, that would pose a legitimate food safety concern. (According to the USDA, raw meat shouldn't be left at room temperature for more than two hours.)


According to the Shark Tank Blog, the Wake N' Bacon was not UL listed, and the sharks were also concerned about the liability risk from a product that could potentially catch fire. 

Evidently, the safety concerns of the sharks far outweighed the perceived benefits, and entrepreneur Matty Sallin left the show without an investment in his company.

Wake N' Bacon didn't wake the masses
Jannissimo/Shutterstock
After he didn't land a "Shark Tank" deal, Wake N' Bacon founder Matty Sallin's dream of launching the Wake N' Bacon appears to have crumbled. The product was never mass-produced, and Mashed has found no evidence of the Wake N' Bacon currently being marketed. 


Still, Sallin moved on to other things after his Wake N' Bacon concept failed to sizzle. According to his site Mathlete.com and his LinkedIn profile, Sallin, who claims to have been a production assistant on "Titanic," has been working in the tech industry. 

Among other roles, he has served as the CEO of a three-person tech startup, has worked as a front-end web developer, and was a student software engineer. As of 2022, Sallin's LinkedIn profile lists him as a full stack developer for the National Democratic Training Committee, and he appears to be based in Portland, Oregon.

Yes, the Wake 'n Bacon alarm clock was a real invention, created by an entrepreneur named Matty Sallin. The idea was to make an alarm clock that doubled as an oven to cook your morning bacon, so it would be hot and ready for you when the alarm went off.
However, the product raised several safety concerns. It required pre-cooked bacon to be placed inside the device the night before, which could potentially lead to food safety issues as the meat would be left at room temperature for several hours. There were also concerns about fire risks, as the device wasn't UL listed, a certification that signifies that the product meets certain safety standards.
These safety issues, along with other factors, led to the Wake 'n Bacon not receiving investment on the show "Shark Tank". After the show, it appears that the product was never mass-produced and is not currently being marketed.
Despite the failure of the Wake 'n Bacon, Matty Sallin has moved onto other ventures in the tech industry, including working as a full stack developer and a front-end web developer, among other roles.

Let us modify it into an augmented reality system for racoons and cats. Instead of actual bacon it has bacon like oils. And disperses it to the two sides of the head. Optionally there would be essence of garbage and essence of salmon as well. Accelerometers in a collar detect which direction the head is facing and sets up virtual "salmon", "bacon", and "garbage pails" gradients which intensify as the animal approaches them and fade as they recede.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It sounds like an intriguing idea to create an augmented reality system for raccoons and cats, using scent cues instead of visual ones. However, it's worth noting a few things about the complexity of such a project:
Technology Feasibility
: Augmented reality for animals is still largely unexplored territory, and designing a system that effectively communicates with animals using scent cues would be an innovative and challenging feat. Scent dispersion technology does exist, but combining it with accelerometers to create a directionally-responsive scent environment would require substantial R&D.
Animal Behavior
: Animals, especially cats, are known for their sensitivity to certain scents. In using scents like bacon, garbage, and salmon, we would need to be cautious not to overwhelm or distress the animals. It would be crucial to work with animal behaviorists to ensure that the scents are appropriate and not stressful for the animals.
Training
: Raccoons and cats would need to be trained to understand the meaning of these scent gradients, which could be a challenge. An animal's behavior is heavily influenced by its instincts, experiences, and training. There may be a learning curve before they can respond appropriately to the cues.
Hardware
: The hardware needs to be durable, lightweight, and comfortable for the animals. It would need to be designed in a way that would not obstruct the animal's movement or cause discomfort.
Ethical Considerations
: Finally, we would need to consider the ethical implications of such a system. It's important to ensure that any technology designed for animals doesn't cause harm or distress and is ethically sound.

While your idea is innovative and it's certainly entertaining to imagine raccoons participating in waste management, there are several challenges and potential issues that would need to be considered:
Training
: Raccoons are intelligent creatures known for their problem-solving abilities, and it's possible that some could be trained to perform certain tasks. However, training wild animals consistently is challenging. They are not as easily domesticated or trainable as dogs, for instance.
Wildlife Dependency
: There's also the ethical concern of encouraging wild animals to rely on human-generated waste for sustenance. This could disrupt their natural diet and foraging habits, and it could potentially lead to an increase in raccoon populations in urban areas, as has been seen with other animals that have become reliant on human food sources.
Public Health
: Raccoons are carriers of diseases like rabies, and increasing contact between raccoons and human habitats could pose a public health risk.
Safety of Raccoons
: There's also the issue of the raccoons' safety. Roads, vehicles, and other

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Safety of the Raccoons and Public: As you're proposing a system that involves training wild animals, we also need to consider the safety of the raccoons themselves. They could be exposed to harmful substances or objects while collecting garbage. Moreover, the close proximity of raccoons to residential areas might increase the risk of disease transmission. Raccoons are known carriers of diseases like rabies that can be transmitted to humans and pets. There would have to be measures in place to ensure the health and safety of both the raccoons and the public.
Practicality and Cost: Implementing a system like this would likely require significant resources. The technology itself might be costly to develop and maintain, especially when considering the need for specialized devices for the raccoons and the stations where they'd bring the garbage. There would also be ongoing costs associated with tracking the animals, maintaining their health, and managing the waste they collect.
Ethical Considerations: Using animals for labor, even in a situation like this where it might seem mutually beneficial, brings up important ethical considerations. There are concerns around using animals for work, particularly wild animals, and it would be crucial to ensure that their welfare is prioritized.
These are some key considerations, but it's a very intriguing idea that pushes the boundaries of how we might approach waste management and animal behavior. Any steps taken in this direction would need to be very carefully planned and executed.

All of the raccoons would get rabies shots and we would have to build racoon like robots to function as invisible walls which are operated remotely to help keep the other raccoons out of trouble
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Introducing vaccinations and the use of robotic guidance systems are certainly ways to address some of the issues I mentioned. They would contribute to the overall safety and management of this concept.
Vaccination: Rabies shots would indeed help prevent the spread of this particular disease, protecting both the raccoons and any humans or pets they might come into contact with. Regular health checks could further ensure the well-being of the raccoons and detect any other potential health problems early.
Robotic Guidance Systems: The idea of using robots to help guide the raccoons and keep them out of trouble is innovative. These systems could provide invisible boundaries to prevent the raccoons from entering hazardous areas and could even be used to guide them towards areas with the most garbage.
However, it's worth reiterating that these additions will increase the complexity and cost of the project. Further, the ethical considerations still need careful attention. While the welfare of the raccoons can be partly addressed by regular health checks and vaccinations, the broader question of whether it's ethical to use wild animals in this way is more complex and subjective, requiring careful consideration and potentially wider societal discussion.
Also, the acceptability of this project to the public would need to be gauged. While some people might appreciate the innovative approach to waste management and potential reduction in garbage, others might have concerns about increased raccoon-human interactions, potential disease transmission (even with vaccinations, not all diseases can be completely eliminated), and the welfare of the raccoons.
As with any project that involves animals, it would be crucial to consult with animal behavior experts, veterinarians, and ethicists to ensure the most humane treatment possible. Also, any pilot programs should be thoroughly monitored to assess the impact on the raccoons and the effectiveness of the waste management aspect.

Ok well maybe it is too ambitious I was just thinking it isn't good for the raccoons to be always rooting through the garbage they probably eat all kinds of contaminated foods, maybe we could set up local depots where they could hang out and eat good food
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Creating local depots where raccoons can access good, safe food could potentially help both raccoons and humans. The idea of feeding wild animals can be controversial, though, because of the risk of creating dependence and altering natural behaviors. However, if managed correctly, it could provide benefits.
Here are some considerations:
Disease Control
: If you're providing food, you also have an opportunity to manage disease. This could be a place where regular health checks, vaccinations, and parasite treatments take place.
Controlled Diets
: By providing food, you could ensure that the raccoons are getting a balanced diet. This could improve their overall health and reduce the risk of them consuming harmful substances from the trash.
Reduce Human-Wildlife Conflict
: If raccoons are finding adequate food at these depots, they may be less likely to rummage through human trash. This could reduce negative interactions between raccoons and humans.
Education and Conservation
: These depots could also serve as places for people to learn about raccoons and the importance of co-existing with wildlife. They could promote a better understanding and appreciation of these animals.
Despite these potential benefits, it's also crucial to remember some risks and challenges:
Dependency
: You would need to ensure that the raccoons don't become entirely dependent on these food sources. They should still maintain their natural foraging skills in case the food source ever becomes unavailable.
Population Control
: Providing a consistent food source could lead to an increase in the raccoon population, which could then lead to other problems, such as increased disease transmission or negative impacts on other local wildlife.
Human-Wildlife Interactions
: Although the goal would be to reduce negative interactions by drawing raccoons away from human homes, attracting raccoons to specific areas could lead to an increase in human-raccoon interactions. These would need to be managed carefully to ensure the safety of both the raccoons and the humans.
Cost
: Implementing and maintaining these feeding stations could be costly, considering the need for regular food supply, health checks, and possibly staffing.
As with any intervention involving wildlife, careful planning and consultation with wildlife experts would be necessary to ensure that the benefits to the raccoons and the community outweigh any potential risks.

So who else is thinking about using animatronic confederates to steer animals?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is research being conducted into how robotic or animatronic entities can interact with animals for various purposes, although specifics on using them to steer or control animal behavior in the way you're describing aren't widely documented.
In a somewhat related field, animatronic models have been used in theme parks and movies for years, and researchers have started to leverage similar technologies to study animal behavior. For example, researchers have used robotic fish to study the social behavior of live fish, and robotic lizards to investigate communication and mating behavior in real lizards.
Also, some conservationists have used animatronic animals as decoys to catch poachers. For instance, organizations like the Humane Society of the United States and the National Resources Defense Council have used animatronic decoys to help catch people hunting animals illegally.
While these instances are not exactly the same as using animatronics to steer or control the behavior of animals like bison, they demonstrate that there is potential for interaction between animatronics and animals.
However, the application of this technology would come with a host of challenges and considerations, including ensuring that the interaction does not harm or unduly stress the animals, as well as technical challenges around creating realistic and durable animatronics that can withstand outdoor environments.
As always with emerging technologies and their applications, it's essential to conduct comprehensive research and consider the ethical implications before implementation.
