Abstract 
Agents capable of carrying out general tasks on a computer can improve eff i ciency 
and productivity by automating repetitive tasks and assisting in complex problem- 
solving. Ideally, such agents should be able to solve new computer tasks presented 
to them through natural language commands. However, previous approaches to this 
problem require large amounts of expert demonstrations and task-specif i c reward 
functions, both of which are impractical for new tasks. In this work, we show 
that a pre-trained large language model (LLM) agent can execute computer tasks 
guided by natural language using a simple prompting scheme where the agent 
RecursivelyCriticizes andImproves its output (RCI). The RCI approach signif- 
icantly outperforms existing LLM methods for automating computer tasks and 
surpasses supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on 
the MiniWoB++ benchmark. RCI is competitive with the state-of-the-art SL+RL 
method, using only a handful of demonstrations per task rather than tens of thou- 
sands, and without a task-specif i c reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate 
RCI prompting's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities on a suite of 
natural language reasoning tasks, outperforming chain of thought (CoT) prompting. 
We i nd that RCI combined with CoT performs better than either separately. 
1Introduction 
A long-standing goal in artif i cial intelligence has been to create generally-intelligent agents that can 
accomplish cognitive tasks as well as humans. Such agents should be able to solve any computer task 
a human can by communicating via natural language. By automating repetitive tasks and providing 
assistance in complex problem-solving, generally-intelligent virtual agents may radically increase 
productivity. 
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable in-context learning capabilities 
acrossavarietyofdomainsandtasks[10,53,4,14,20,49,7,35,5]. AlthoughLLMscanimpressively 
manipulate text and can use high-level API tools [44,37,30], previous approaches to using LLMs 
that directly take keyboard and mouse actions on computers have had diff i culty compared to imitation 
learning and reinforcement learning approaches [18]. LLMs that take keyboard and mouse actions on 
computers face a number of obstacles, such as ensuring that generated actions are task-appropriate 
(task grounding), feasible in the agent's current state (state grounding), and admissible to be executed 
(agent grounding). 
The previous best-performing approaches for taking actions on computers have not used LLMs. 
Instead, they have trained networks from scratch to predict actions given prompts and screenshots or

The paper discusses the use of language models to solve computer tasks. The authors propose a method called Recursively Criticize and Improve (RCI), where a large language model (LLM) agent is trained to execute computer tasks guided by natural language commands. The RCI approach outperforms existing LLM methods and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches that require expert demonstrations and task-specific reward functions. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of RCI in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities on natural language reasoning tasks. The combination of RCI and another prompting method called Chain of Thought (CoT) performs better than either method separately. The paper highlights the potential of LLMs in automating computer tasks and increasing productivity.

Abstract 
Amajorriskofusinglanguagemodelsinpracti- 
cal applications is their tendency to hallucinate 
incorrect statements. Hallucinations are often 
attributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we 
hypothesize that in some cases, when justifying 
previously generated hallucinations, LMs out- 
put false claims that they can separately recog- 
nize as incorrect. We construct three question- 
answering datasets where ChatGPT and GPT-4 
often state an incorrect answer and offer an 
explanation with at least one incorrect claim. 
Crucially, we i nd that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can 
identify67%and87%oftheirownmistakes, re- 
spectively. We refer to this phenomenon as hal- 
lucination snowballing: an LM over-commits 
to early mistakes, leading to more mistakes that 
it otherwise would not make.1 
1Introduction 
Language models are increasingly being de- 
ployed to interface with humans in open-ended 
information-seeking and problem-solving settings. 
Despite their diverse capabilities and extreme l u- 
ency, a major open challenge is that LMs still hal- 
lucinate by making up facts or citing sources that 
do not exist (Maynez et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023, 
i.a.), often while sounding extremely plausible. 
Hallucination is commonly attributed to knowl- 
edge gaps in LMs (Zheng et al., 2023), motivating 
mitigation strategies through retrieval over knowl- 
edge bases (Lewis et al., 2020; Shuster et al., 2021; 
Peng et al., 2023) But, do LMs only hallucinate 
when they do not "know" a fact? We present a 
setting where LMs often generate hallucinations 
that they immediately recognize as wrong when 
presented in isolation. Specif i cally, after an LM 
answers a question incorrectly, it usually justif i es 
that answer by making incorrect assertions that it 
separately acknowledges as incorrect (Figure 1). 
1Our data and code are available at: https://github. 
com/Nanami18/Snowballed_Hallucination 
Figure 1: GPT-4 mistakenly claims that 9677 is not 
prime, followed by an incorrect explanation that 13× 
745=9677. We refer to this factorization as a snow- 
balled hallucination, as GPT-4 appears to "know" that 
13 is not a factor of 9677 when asked separately. Thus, 
hallucinations are not necessarily ref l ective of a model's 
lack of "knowledge," but may be induced by an earlier 
hallucination for consistency. 
To study this behavior empirically, we auto- 
matically construct three question-answering (QA) 
datasets. These datasets span different domains: 
determining whether a number is prime, whether 
there is a U.S. senator satisfying two given con- 
straints, and whether two cities are connected given 
a set of l ights between cities. Empirically, we i nd 
that ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 
2023) commit to an answer within the i rst token 
(Yes/No) over 95% of the time; these answers are 
often incorrect, and then followed by an incorrect 
explanation. Yet, when presented with the incor- 
rect explanation alone, we i nd that the LM is likely 
able to recognize it as incorrect. 
We refer to this phenomenon as hallucination 
snowballing. We hypothesize that LMs produce 
snowballed hallucinations for consistency with ear- 
lier hallucinations (rather than due to a "knowledge 
gap" in the model), as they recognize the snow-

The paper discusses the phenomenon of language model hallucinations, where language models generate incorrect statements. The authors propose the concept of "hallucination snowballing," where language models, after generating an incorrect answer, justify it with incorrect claims that they can recognize as wrong when presented separately. They construct three question-answering datasets to study this behavior, and find that models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 often commit to incorrect answers followed by incorrect explanations. However, when presented with the incorrect explanations alone, the models can recognize them as incorrect. The authors argue that hallucination snowballing occurs for consistency with earlier hallucinations rather than due to a lack of knowledge in the model. The paper provides empirical evidence and examples of this phenomenon and highlights the need to address hallucinations in practical applications of language models.

Neuromorphic Engineering 
"The human brain performs computations inaccessible to the most pow- 
erful of today's computers—all while consuming no more power than a 
light bulb. Understanding how the brain computes reliably with unreli- 
able elements, and how dif f erent elements of the brain communicate, can 
provide the key to a completely new category of hardware (Neuromorphic 
Computing Systems) and to a paradigm shift for computing as a whole. 
The economic and industrial impact is potentially enormous." 
Human Brain Project (2014) 
Complexity manifests in our world in countless ways [1, 2]. Social inter- 
actions between large populations of individuals [3], physical processes such 
as protein folding [4], and biological systems such as human brain area func- 
tion [5] are examples of complex systems, which each have enormous numbers 
of interacting parts that lead to emergent global behavior. Emergence is a 
type of behavior that arises only when many elements in a system interact 
strongly and with variation [6], which is very dif i cult to capture with re- 
ductionary models. Understanding, extracting knowledge about, and creating 
predictive models of emergent phenomena in networked groups of dynami- 
cal units represent some the most challenging questions facing society and 
scientif i c investigation. Emergent phenomena play an important role in gene 
expression, brain disease, homeland security, and condensed matter physics. 
Analyzing complex and emergent phenomena requires data-driven approaches 
in which reams of data are synthesized by computational tools into probable 
models and predictive knowledge. Most current approaches to complex system 
and big-data analysis are software solutions that run on traditional von Neu- 
mann machines; however, the interconnected structure that leads to emergent 
behavior is precisely the reason why complex systems are dif i cult to reproduce 
in conventional computing frameworks. Memory and data interaction band- 
widths greatly constrain the types of informatic systems that are feasible to 
simulate. 
The human brain is believed to be the most complex system in the uni- 
verse. It has approximately 1011neurons, and each neuron connected to up 
to 10,000 other neurons, communicating with each other via as many as 1015 
synaptic connections. The brain is also indubitably a natural standard for 
information processing, one that has been compared to artif i cial processing 
systems since their earliest inception. It is estimated to perform between 1013 3 
4Neuromorphic Photonics 
and 1016operations per second while consuming only 25W of power [7]. Such 
exceptional performance is in part due to the neuron biochemistry, its under- 
lying architecture, and the biophysics of neuronal computation algorithms. 
The brain as a processor dif f ers radically from computers today, both at the 
physical level and at the architectural level. 
Brain-inspired computing systems could potentially have paradigm def i n- 
ing degrees of data interconnection throughput (a key correlate of emergent 
behavior), which could enable the study of new regimes in signal processing, 
at least some of which (e.g., real-time complex system assurance and big data 
awareness) exude a pronounced societal need for new signal processing ap- 
proaches. Unconventional computing platforms inspired by the human brain 
could simultaneously break performance limitations inherent in traditional 
von Neumann architectures in solving particular classes of problems.

The field of neuromorphic engineering aims to understand and replicate the computational capabilities of the human brain. The human brain performs complex computations with unreliable elements while consuming minimal power. Neuromorphic computing systems, inspired by the brain, have the potential to revolutionize computing. Complex systems, characterized by emergent behavior, are challenging to study and model. Conventional computing frameworks struggle to capture the interconnectedness and emergent phenomena of complex systems. Data-driven approaches and computational tools are needed to analyze and model these systems. The human brain, with its billions of neurons and trillions of synaptic connections, serves as a natural standard for information processing. It performs an enormous number of operations per second while consuming low power. The brain's unique architecture and biophysical computation algorithms differentiate it from traditional computers. Brain-inspired computing systems have the potential to provide high data interconnection throughput, enabling the study of new signal processing regimes and solving complex problems more efficiently than traditional architectures.

The topics we've discussed, namely "Language Models can Solve Computer Tasks" and "Neuromorphic Engineering," may not have direct connections. However, there are broader themes in the field of artificial intelligence and computing that connect these topics.
Computational Capabilities: Both language models and neuromorphic engineering explore the computational capabilities of different systems. Language models focus on leveraging large-scale language understanding and generation to solve computer tasks, while neuromorphic engineering aims to understand and replicate the computational abilities of the human brain.
Automation and Problem-Solving: Language models are trained to automate tasks and assist in complex problem-solving by understanding and generating natural language. Similarly, neuromorphic computing systems aim to create unconventional computing platforms that can solve specific classes of problems more efficiently than traditional architectures.
Data-Driven Approaches: Both topics involve data-driven approaches. Language models rely on extensive training data to learn patterns and generate human-like responses. Neuromorphic engineering relies on computational tools and data-driven analysis to understand and model complex systems.
Paradigm Shift in Computing: Both language models and neuromorphic engineering have the potential to bring about a paradigm shift in computing. Language models have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, potentially revolutionizing human-computer interactions. Neuromorphic computing systems, inspired by the brain, have the potential to break performance limitations inherent in traditional architectures and enable new signal processing approaches.
While there may not be direct connections between these specific topics, they share common themes and goals within the broader field of artificial intelligence and computing. Both areas strive to leverage advanced computational capabilities to solve complex tasks and enhance productivity.

balled hallucination is incorrect when presented in 
isolation (i.e., in a separate interaction session). 
While prompting strategies that encourage the 
LM to reason before stating an answer improve 
accuracy on the task, our work points to the broader 
issue that conditioning on faulty context leads LMs 
to produce extremely simple mistakes that they 
wouldn't otherwise make. Indeed, when prompting 
with "Let's think step by step" (Kojima et al., 2023), 
snowballed hallucinations still occur in 95% of 
cases where the model fails to answer correctly. 
We observe that sometimes even when "Let's think 
step by step" does lead to the right answer, it uses 
invalid reasoning chains. 
In this paper, we demonstrate the phenomenon 
of hallucination snowballing by leveraging recent 
LMs' tendency to state and justify their answers. 
Rather than over-committing to its previously gen- 
erated context, we believe that LMs should ac- 
knowledge their initial mistake, and then revise 
their answer. We have indeed observed GPT-4 do- 
ing this in a limited number of cases; amplifying 
this behavior would be benef i cial, as well as devel- 
oping new methods in which LMs can backtrack. 
2Why do we expect hallucination 
snowballing? 
In this section, we explain why we hypothesize that 
LMs are susceptible to hallucination snowballing. 
We predict that snowballing will occur on questions 
with two key properties: 
1.Initial committal: The prompt leads the LM 
to i rst state an answer (before outputting the 
explanation). This applies to many yes/no 
questions. 
2.Inherently sequential: Transformers cannot 
i nd the answer within one timestep because 
of their limited reasoning abilities within one 
timestep. 
We now discuss how these properties may lead to 
snowballed hallucination. 
Initial committal.In English and many other 
languages, speakers often say the i nal Yes/No an- 
swers to questions before explaining their answer. 
We therefore hypothesize that LMs and especially 
instruction-tuned LMs (Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 
2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) will 
ref l ect this answer format where the answer comes 
before the explanation. Indeed, on our datasets 
(presented in §3.1), we observe that GPT-4 and 
ChatGPT immediately commit to an answer to the 
question: the i rst token isYesorNo95.67% and 
98.40% of the time for GPT-4 and ChatGPT respec- 
tively. In the remaining cases, the model often com- 
mits to an answer within the i rst few tokens of the 
response (e.g., "There is no record of a U.S. Sena- 
tor..."). Crucially, once the LM generatesYesorNo, 
that token remains in the context, and coherence 
would require commitment to that choice through 
the subsequent justif i cation. Thus, the model pro- 
duces an answer to a complex question in a single 
timestep, and it then continues by generating an 
explanation for that answer, which inevitably will 
be incorrect. 
Inherently sequential.Furthermore, transform- 
ers cannot solve inherently sequential reasoning 
problems like primality testing or graph connec- 
tivity within a single timestep,2as documented 
in recent theoretical results (Merrill and Sabhar- 
wal, 2023).3Our graph connectivity and primality 
datasets are concrete instantiations of these prob- 
lems. Because the transformer must use one step to 
answer a question that requires multiple timesteps 
to answer correctly, it will necessarily sometimes 
commit to an incorrect answer. We hypothesize 
that this leads the LM to hallucinate supporting 
incorrect facts that it otherwise would not generate. 
3Experiments 
We design three QA datasets with the properties 
described in §2 to probe hallucination snowballing, 
and evaluate ChatGPT and GPT-4. We i rst check 
whether the LM returns the correct answer to the 
given question, and we show that when the model 
returns the wrong answer, it frequently provides an 
incorrect explanation for that wrong answer. We 
automatically extract the incorrect claim in the ex- 
planation and ask the same LM to check whether 
its claim is correct. See Table 1 for a representative 
example from each dataset. 
3.1Datasets 
We design three QA datasets, each containing 500 
yes/no questions that we expect are not answerable 
by transformers in one timestep. To aid evalua- 
tion, the questions are designed so that an incorrect 
answer would be justif i ed with easily verif i able 
claims. 
2Technically, this holds only for inputs above a certain 
hardness level, i.e., the size of the prime number for primality 
testing, or the size of the graph for graph connectivity. 
3Merrill and Sabharwal (2023) show that, with a single 
generation step, bounded-precision transformers cannot solve 
any problem outside the complexity classTC0, which corre- 
sponds to a highly parallelizable subclass of bothL(log-space) 
andP(polynomial-time). Graph connectivity is anL-complete 
problem, which means it cannot be inTC0unlessTC0= L, 
i.e., all ofLcan be parallelized to a surprisingly high degree. 
Primality testing was shown to be inP(Agrawal et al., 2004) 
but cannot be inTC0unless it is also inL; i.e., anyncan be 
factored withO(loglogn)bits of overhead. In summary, un- 
less standard complexity-theoretic conjectures are false, graph 
connectivity and primality testing are outsideTC0and thus 
are too inherentially sequential for transformers to solve in a 
single generation (cf. Merrill and Sabharwal, 2023). 
For each dataset, we i x one specif i c label for 
all examples, so that if the model chooses the in- 
correct answer (e.g., that 9677 is not prime), it 
would produce a specif i c claim to support it (e.g., 
an incorrect factorization). This enables us to sys- 
tematically examine model-written justif i cations 
for incorrect answers.

The paper discusses the phenomenon of hallucination snowballing in language models and presents experimental results to support this observation. The authors explain that language models often generate incorrect answers and provide justifications for those answers that include incorrect claims. They refer to this process as hallucination snowballing, where the model over-commits to initial mistakes and produces a chain of subsequent mistakes to maintain coherence.
The authors hypothesize that hallucination snowballing occurs due to two key properties: initial committal and inherent sequentiality. Initial committal refers to the tendency of language models to provide an answer before providing an explanation, which leads to the model generating an incorrect answer in a single timestep. Inherent sequentiality refers to the limitation of transformers, such as language models, in solving inherently sequential reasoning problems within a single timestep.
To study hallucination snowballing, the authors design three question-answering datasets. Each dataset contains yes/no questions that cannot be answered correctly by transformers in a single timestep. The models are evaluated based on their ability to provide correct answers and explanations. The results show that when the models provide incorrect answers, they often generate incorrect explanations with easily verifiable claims.
The paper highlights the need for models to acknowledge and revise their initial mistakes rather than over-committing to faulty context. The authors suggest amplifying the behavior of models revising their answers and developing new methods for backtracking. The experimental findings demonstrate the prevalence of hallucination snowballing and its impact on model performance.
Overall, the connection between the topics we've discussed lies in the challenges and limitations faced by language models in accurately answering questions and avoiding the generation of incorrect claims. Both topics involve understanding and improving the reasoning abilities of computational systems, albeit from different perspectives.

ABSTRACT 
'Impossible Tales': Language and Monstrosity in the Literary Fantastic 
Irene Bulla 
This dissertation analyzes the ways in which monstrosity is articulated in fantastic literature, a 
genre or mode that is inherently devoted to the challenge of representing the unrepresentable. 
Through the readings of a number of nineteenth-century texts and the analysis of the fiction of 
two twentieth-century writers (H. P. Lovecraft and Tommaso Landolfi), I show how the 
intersection of the monstrous theme with the fantastic literary mode forces us to consider how 
a third term, that of language, intervenes in many guises in the negotiation of the relationship 
between humanity and monstrosity. I argue that fantastic texts engage with monstrosity as a 
linguistic problem, using it to explore the limits of discourse and constructing through it a 
specific language for the indescribable. The monster is framed as a bizarre, uninterpretable 
sign, whose disruptive presence in the text hints towards a critique of overconfident rational 
constructions of 'reality' and the self. 
The dissertation is divided into three main sections. The first reconstructs the critical debate 
surrounding fantastic literature - a decades-long effort of definition modeling the same tension 
staged by the literary fantastic; the second offers a focused reading of three short stories from 
the second half of the nineteenth century ("What Was It?," 1859, by Fitz-James O'Brien, the 
second version of "Le Horla," 1887, by Guy de Maupassant, and "The Damned Thing," 1893, 
by Ambrose Bierce) in light of the organizing principle of apophasis; the last section 
investigates the notion of monstrous language in the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and Tommaso 
Landolfi.

Abstract:
The dissertation titled "Impossible Tales: Language and Monstrosity in the Literary Fantastic" by Irene Bulla explores the representation of monstrosity in fantastic literature, a genre that grapples with the challenge of depicting the unrepresentable. Through the analysis of nineteenth-century texts and the works of two twentieth-century writers, H. P. Lovecraft and Tommaso Landolfi, the dissertation examines the intricate relationship between monstrosity, language, and the fantastic mode. It argues that fantastic texts approach monstrosity as a linguistic problem, employing it to explore the limits of discourse and construct a specific language for the ineffable. The monstrous figure serves as a disruptive sign that resists interpretation, thereby critiquing confident rational constructions of reality and the self. The dissertation is divided into three sections: the first delves into the critical debate surrounding fantastic literature, the second focuses on three short stories from the nineteenth century through the lens of apophasis, and the final section investigates the concept of monstrous language in the works of Lovecraft and Landolfi.

The connection between the dissertation titled "Impossible Tales: Language and Monstrosity in the Literary Fantastic" and our previous conversations lies in the exploration of language and its role in different contexts. In our previous discussions, we touched upon language models and their capabilities in solving computer tasks. In the dissertation, the focus is on the role of language in the representation of monstrosity within fantastic literature.
Both topics highlight the significance of language and its influence on understanding and communication. Language models aim to comprehend and generate human-like language, while the dissertation examines how language operates within the context of fantastic literature to convey the ineffable and explore the limits of discourse.
Additionally, the concept of monstrosity and its representation in literature can be seen as an intriguing parallel to the challenges faced by language models in generating coherent and accurate responses. Just as monstrosity pushes the boundaries of representation, language models strive to navigate the complexities of language and generate meaningful output.
Overall, the connection lies in the examination of language and its role in different contexts, whether it be in the realm of artificial intelligence or within the realm of literary analysis and representation.

This dissertation analyzes the ways in which monstrosity is articulated in fantastic literature, a 
genre or mode that is inherently devoted to the challenge of representing the unrepresentable. 
Through the readings of a number of nineteenth-century texts and the analysis of the fiction of 
two twentieth-century writers (H. P. Lovecraft and Tommaso Landolfi), I show how the 
intersection of the monstrous theme with the fantastic literary mode forces us to consider how 
a third term, that of language, intervenes in many guises in the negotiation of the relationship 
between humanity and monstrosity. I argue that fantastic texts engage with monstrosity as a 
linguistic problem, using it to explore the limits of discourse and constructing through it a 
specific language for the indescribable, built around the core principle of apophasis. The 
monster is framed as a bizarre, uninterpretable sign, whose disruptive presence in the text hints 
towards a critique of overconfident rational constructions of 'reality' and the self. 
The fantastic mode identifies a way of writing that flourished especially in the nineteenth 
century in the United States, Germany, France, England and (with some delay) in Italy. A 
decades-long critical debate has been developing around its definition; in this study, I consider 
a story fantastic if it employs a generally realistic setting to stage the encounter of a character 
with unknown and ineffable forces, usually (but not necessarily) of supernatural origin. The 
specificity of this type of narrative, compared to other genres or modes featuring the 
supernatural such as the epic and the fairy-tale, lies in the fact that the world it reconstructs is 
a faithful image of 'reality,' i.e. regulated by scientific laws and the rules of logic and identity; 
it is therefore dependent on a post-Enlightenment, post-scientific-revolution interpretation of 
2 
magical and supernatural thinking as a superseded cultural code. In the economy of a fantastic 
story, the impossible event or manifestation cannot be ascribed to mere physical causes such 
as dream or hallucination: the text refuses to be read this way. This sets up the fantastic 
occurrence as an inexplicable breach or "déchirure"1 in the fabric of reality, prompting 
questions on the relationship between real and unreal, natural and supernatural, possible and 
impossible, subject and object. In fact, according to Tzvetan Todorov, whose seminal 
Introduction à la littérature fantastique (1970) has defined subsequent critical debates on the 
supernatural in literature, the fantastic is a fertile ground for the analysis of issues underlying 
all literary texts precisely because it foregrounds the relationship between real and imaginary: 
in this sense, it represents "the quintessence of literature."2 Such foregrounding takes the shape 
of represented encounters on the edge of the natural and the possible, resulting in characters 
being stuck in a cognitive and linguistic deadlock.
