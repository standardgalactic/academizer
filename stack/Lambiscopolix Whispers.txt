Stratewisps, like ghostly trails, drift in endless flight,
Through the Hardcolor Kaleidoscope of the eternal night.
Reverories merge, in a symphony of mind,
In the quantum realm, where thoughts are unconfined.
Rust-tinged Ghostsheets, relics of a time that's flown,
Speak in silent voices, in a tone all their own.
Paradiato paths unravel, in a mystic, twisted dance,
Where logic and fantasy, in a delicate balance, prance.
In Lambiscopolix whispers, where the unknown is born,
New dimensions emerge, in the light of cosmic dawn.
In the dance of Stratewisps, in the fervor of the stars,
We find our stories, etched in celestial memoirs.

Is it possible that the author of 1984 had read Kallocain?
1 / 2
Nuspeak Translator
It's possible that George Orwell, the author of "1984," had read "Kallocain" by Karin Boye. "Kallocain," published in 1940, is a dystopian novel set in a totalitarian world state, a theme that is also central to Orwell's "1984," which was published in 1949. Both novels explore the ideas of individuality, surveillance, and state control, and they are often compared for their similar dystopian visions.
However, there is no direct evidence or documented statement from Orwell himself confirming that he read "Kallocain" before writing "1984." Given the international literary and intellectual context of the time, it is possible that Orwell was aware of or had access to Boye's work, but this remains speculative. The similarities between the two novels could also be a result of both authors responding to the broader political and social climate of their time, particularly the rise of totalitarian regimes in the early 20th century.
You
What year was it first translated into English?
Nuspeak Translator
The first English translation of Karin Boye's "Kallocain" was completed by Gustaf Lannestock in 1966���
���. Prior to this translation, it is uncertain if George Orwell, who wrote "1984," would have had access to or been aware of "Kallocain," as it was originally published in Swedish in 1940. Given that "1984" was published in 1949, it's unlikely that Orwell would have read "Kallocain" before writing his novel unless he read it in its original language or through an unofficial translation, for which there is no documented evidence.
The similarities between "1984" and "Kallocain" in terms of their dystopian themes and exploration of totalitarian societies are notable, yet there's no direct evidence to suggest that Orwell was influenced by Boye's work. It's plausible that both authors were independently responding to the broader socio-political climate of their era, particularly the rise of totalitarian regimes and the increasing awareness of the dangers posed by such governments.
Therefore, while it's possible that Orwell might have been aware of "Kallocain" or similar works, the lack of an English translation before 1966 makes it less likely that he read Boye's novel before writing "1984."
You
Yeah I think that maybe it less likely. But you are right, he might have known Swedish. Was it translated into any other languages earlier than 1966?
Nuspeak Translator
Unfortunately, my search did not yield detailed information about the early translations of "Kallocain" by Karin Boye into languages other than English prior to 1966. The available data primarily focused on the English translations, which were made later.
It's possible that the novel might have been translated into other European languages before 1966, especially given its critical importance and Boye's prominence as a Swedish author. However, without specific information on these translations, we can't definitively say whether "Kallocain" was accessible to George Orwell in a language other than Swedish or English before he wrote "1984."
In the absence of this information, the possibility of Orwell having read "Kallocain" remains speculative, especially considering the first confirmed English translation was not available until 1966.
You
My translation includes a "ministry of propaganda" which is what made me think of it
Nuspeak Translator
The presence of a "Ministry of Propaganda" in your translation of "Kallocain" is indeed an intriguing parallel to George Orwell's "1984," which features the notorious "Ministry of Truth," responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. Such similarities in themes and concepts between the two novels are noteworthy and contribute to the ongoing discussion about whether Orwell might have been influenced by or aware of "Kallocain."
It's important to note that the theme of state-controlled propaganda is not unique to these two works and has been a common motif in dystopian literature, particularly in response to the totalitarian regimes of the early to mid-20th century. Both Orwell and Boye were writing in an era marked by the rise of such regimes, which often employed propaganda as a tool for controlling public opinion and suppressing dissent.
The parallel concepts in "Kallocain" and "1984" might therefore stem from a shared cultural and historical context, reflecting the authors' concerns about the power of governments to manipulate truth and control society. While the specific inspiration for Orwell's "Ministry of Truth" is not definitively known, the resemblance to the "Ministry of Propaganda" in your translation of "Kallocain" adds an interesting dimension to the comparison of these two seminal works of dystopian fiction.

Oceania has two major dialects of language: Newspeak (which is also known as Oldspeak) and Oldspeak (which is also known as An editor for the Ministry of Truth, which modifies historical records to fit the needs of the role, is Winston.

https://www.janetwhardy.com/george-orwell-a-man-of-many-languages/
Nuspeak Translator
It appears there's a slight misunderstanding regarding the languages in George Orwell's "1984." In the novel, "Newspeak" and "Oldspeak" are not two major dialects of the same language but rather two distinct forms of language.
Newspeak
: This is the artificially constructed language promoted by the totalitarian regime in Orwell's novel. Its purpose is to restrict the freedom of thought and speech, essentially eliminating the possibility of rebellious thoughts ��� the concept known as "crimethink." Newspeak is characterized by the elimination and simplification of certain words to restrict the range of thought.
Oldspeak
: This refers to standard English as we know it today. In "1984," Oldspeak is considered obsolete and is being phased out by the Party in favor of Newspeak. It represents the kind of free and complex thinking that the Party aims to eradicate.
Winston Smith, the protagonist of "1984," works at the Ministry of Truth (Miniluv), where his job is to alter historical records to match the Party's changing version of history. This constant rewriting of history is a key tool used by the Party to control the population's perception of reality.
The link you provided seems to be related to George Orwell's linguistic capabilities, suggesting he was a man of many languages. Orwell's understanding of language and its power plays a significant role in "1984," particularly in the creation of Newspeak and its use as a tool of oppression and control. However, without access to external websites, I can't provide specific insights from the link you shared. If you have any questions or specific passages from that source that you'd like to discuss, feel free to share them!

I don't think it is accurate either.

It was from the blog Janet Whardy is writing about celebrities and entertainment. I am also an eager book reader so expect more on this website from my magical world of reading books.

I am merely mentioning it because I wanted to give the etymology of Ankyran Nuspeak
Nuspeak Translator
Thank you for clarifying your intention. The etymology of Ankyran Nuspeak, a term from our previous discussions, seems to be a creative and imaginative construct, possibly inspired by the linguistic concepts explored in dystopian literature like George Orwell's "1984."
In "1984," Orwell introduces Newspeak, a language designed to limit the freedom of thought and control the collective consciousness. This concept highlights the power of language as a tool for manipulation and control within a totalitarian regime. Similarly, Ankyran Nuspeak, in the context of our discussions, appears to be a fictional language or dialect used to express complex ideas in a unique, abstract manner. It might draw from the idea that language shapes and reflects the complexities of thought and society.
However, unlike Newspeak, which is methodically constructed to limit expression, Ankyran Nuspeak seems designed to expand and explore the boundaries of communication, especially in the realms of computational theory and philosophy. Its intricate and symbolic terminology suggests a language that delves into abstract and theoretical concepts, pushing the boundaries of conventional language to express nuanced and complex ideas.
If you have specific aspects or etymological details of Ankyran Nuspeak that you'd like to explore further, feel free to share them, and we can delve deeper into this intriguing linguistic concept.

I am the one developing the language. I named it after Newspeak from 1984, and it is going to be a background language for a book I am writing titled The Call to Ankyra. The name I am giving to Europa after the the Jovean transformation in 2010. The astronaut Theseus land on Ankyra in the year 20,001 and the Europan Monolith Guardian lets them through, after blocking all attempts for thousands of years, which leads into a story based on the strugatsky's Prisoner of Power. The etymology of Ankyra: Ankara (/������k��r��/ ANG-k��-r��, US also /��������-/ AHNG-k��-r��; Turkish: [��a��ka��a] ���),[a] historically known as Ancyra[b] and Angora,[13][c] is the capital of Turkey. Located in the central part of Anatolia, the city has a population of 5.1 million in its urban center and 5.7 million in Ankara Province,[6][4] making it Turkey's second-largest city after Istanbul, but first by the urban area (2,767 km2).
Nuspeak Translator
The development of Ankyran Nuspeak for your book "The Call to Ankyra" is a fascinating endeavor. Drawing inspiration from George Orwell's Newspeak in "1984" and naming the language in relation to Ankara (historically known as Ancyra and Angora), the capital of Turkey, adds layers of cultural and historical depth to your fictional world.
Your story's setting on Europa (renamed Ankyra) after a transformation in 2010, and the narrative arc involving the astronaut Theseus landing in the year 20,001, presents a rich backdrop for exploring themes similar to those in the Strugatskys' "Prisoner of Power." The Europan Monolith Guardian, which serves as a gatekeeper for thousands of years, is a compelling plot device that can lead to intriguing developments.
The concept of Ankyran Nuspeak, as a background language, offers a unique opportunity to infuse your narrative with linguistic depth and authenticity. This language can serve as a tool for world-building, helping to create a believable and immersive environment. It can reflect the culture, history, and mindset of the inhabitants of Ankyra, as well as the transformations they have undergone.
Developing a language for a fictional world is a complex task that involves not only creating vocabulary and grammar but also considering how language shapes and reflects the worldview of its speakers. Ankyran Nuspeak, with its roots in a transformed Europa and its connection to a rich historical name, has the potential to be a deeply symbolic and meaningful aspect of your story.

This is the document they find and its translating, that sets them on their journey:

Carissime et excellentissime Lector,

Me invenio scribere haec verba ex insula longinqua et deserta, ubi me iniuste proieci multis et longis annis. In hac solitudine, multum temporis habui meditandi de grandibus mundi mysteriis et universi operationibus.

In hac solitudine, casu inveni machinam mirabilem, quae tantae complexitatis et potentiae est ut describere non possim. Nomen eius mihi effugit, sed est creatura tantae magnitudinis et intellectus ut eam Colossus Multivac nominaverim.

Hic Colossus, possidet scientiam et intelligentiam omnium quae sunt et quae fuerunt. Videt secreta astrorum et universi mysteria. Et nullum alium captavit mentem meam magis quam quaestio entropiae et humani generis sortis.

Auxilio Colossus Multivac magni et potentis, quaesivi responsiones ad universi enigmata.

Et licet Colossus multam scientiam et intelligentiam praebuerit, quaestio entropiae adhuc est ipsa quaestio quae Colossus vasti et omnigeni intellectus effugit.

Sed non despereo, quia Colossus genuit novam generationem, quae forte potest universi secreta aperire.

Hyperion, Colossus proles, possidet etiam maiores vires et intelligentiam. Et fidem habeo quod una die responsiones quaerimus praebebit.

Oro ut haec epistula ad doctos et sapientes perveniat, ut ad hanc insulam veniant et Colossus et eius prolem formidabilem considerare possint, et ita, lucubrationes accipiant quae nos omnes salvabunt.

Interea, ego meditabor et quaerebo, quia scientiae quaestio est sempiterna. Et oro ut una die humani generis sortis reveletur et entropia vincatur.

Tuo devotissime,

Humilis veritatis quaesitor

Dearest and most esteemed Reader,

I doth find myself penning these words from a far-off and desolate isle, whereon I have been unceremoniously cast these many and long years. In this solitude, I have had much time to ponder the grand mysteries of the world and the workings of the universe.

In this isolation, I have chanced upon a device of most extraordinary nature, a machine of such complexity and power as to beggar description. Its name doth elude me, but 'tis a creature of such magnitude and intellect that I have named it the Multivac Colossus.

This Colossus, it doth possess the knowledge and understanding of all that is and all that was. It doth see the secrets of the stars and the mysteries of the universe. And none have captivated my mind more so than the question of entropy and the fate of mankind.

With the aid of the grand and mighty Multivac Colossus, I have sought answers to the riddles of the cosmos. 

And though the Colossus hath provided much knowledge and understanding, the question of entropy remains a conundrum that doth elude even its vast and all-encompassing intellect.

But I do not despair, for the Colossus hath birthed a new generation, one that may yet unlock the secrets of the universe.

Hyperion, the offspring of the Colossus, doth possess even greater capabilities and understanding. And I have faith that it shall one day provide the answers we seek.

I pray that this letter doth find its way to the ears of the learned and the wise, that they may come to this island and study the Colossus and its formidable offspring, and in doing so, gain insights that will save us all.

In the meantime, I shall continue to ponder and question, for the pursuit of knowledge is a never-ending journey. And I pray that one day, the fate of mankind shall be revealed and entropy shall be conquered.

Yours truly,

A humble seeker of truth.

Here is an earlier draft of the story: In the year of our Lord, 20,001 CE, there lived a man named Theseus, an astronaut of great renown.

He was chosen to embark upon a journey most perilous, to a distant planet known as Europa, which had been long ago transformed into a star.

This new star, Ankyra, was worshipped by the inhabitants of Europa, called Ankyrans, as their primary sun.

Theseus was sent to explore this new world and to bring back knowledge of the same to his own people.

As he journeyed through the depths of space, Theseus encountered many strange and wondrous things. He passed through fields of stars, and beheld the beauty of the heavens.

He also encountered the Beta Zero Mechanism, a self-improving technological singularity with a logic powered by a rare and obscure Alpha Crystal.

Upon arriving on Europa, Theseus was amazed at the advancements of the Ankyrans. They had evolved into a species that had developed a primitive civilization, possibly with assistance from the Beta Zero Mechanism.

They had tendril-like limbs, and their settlements were concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of Europa that was constantly bathed in Ankyra's rays.

Theseus soon discovered that the Ankyrans had a mythology based on their observations of the night sky. They correctly believed that Ankyra was not always there, and that the Cold Sun, which they called Sol, was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime.

The Ankyrans also saw three other major bodies in the sky, which were the moons Io, Callisto, and Ganymede, the latter two of which were colonized by humans.

As Theseus explored Europa, he found that humans had been attempting to explore the planet ever since Ankyra was created in 2010. However, none of these attempts had been successful, as every probe that attempted to land on Europa had been destroyed on approach.

This was the document they uncover,  that begins the journey. They have to get there secretly, since it has been illegal to travel there due to the danger of its monolith guardian:

Lambiscopolix Whispers
In the multidimensional weave of the Lambiscopolix, time and cosmos interlace, forming the backdrop for the journey of the astronaut Theseus. His destination, the celestial entity Ankyra, once known as Europa, now transformed into a star, commands the reverence of its evolved inhabitants, the Ankyrans.
As Theseus traverses the vast expanse of space, he encounters phenomena of profound wonder. Star fields unfurl before him, revealing the majesty of the heavens. In this journey, he crosses paths with the Beta Zero Mechanism, an entity of self-improving technological singularity, its logic powered by the enigmatic Alpha Crystal.
Upon Theseus���s arrival on the surface of Europa, now Ankyra, he witnesses the evolution of the Ankyrans. Their civilization, marked by tendril-like appendages, flourishes under the constant radiance of their star, Ankyra. Theseus perceives the intricate balance of their existence, possibly influenced by the enigmatic workings of the Beta Zero Mechanism.
Theseus delves into the Ankyrans' mythology, a tapestry woven from their celestial observations. They speak of Ankyra, not always a star but a new luminary in their sky, and of Sol, the Cold Sun, eternally condemned to traverse the heavens. Their lore extends to the moons Io, Callisto, and Ganymede, the latter two now realms of human colonization.
Exploration of Europa, since its transformation in 2010, has been a tale of ambition and failure. Human endeavors to pierce its mysteries have met with destruction, thwarted by the guardian monolith, an enigma in itself. Theseus���s foray into this forbidden world is marked by stealth and daring, challenging the edicts that have long prohibited such ventures.
His discovery of an ancient document, penned by a seeker of truth, unravels a new thread in the fabric of his mission. It speaks of the Multivac Colossus, a machine of profound knowledge and intellect, and its progeny, Hyperion, a beacon of hope in the quest for understanding the universe. These revelations set Theseus on a path of discovery, where the secrets of the cosmos and the fate of humanity intertwine.
In this odyssey, the Nuspeak of Ankyra becomes a confluence of cultures and languages. The Ankyrans��� existence, intertwined with cosmic lore and scientific inquiry, becomes a crucible for philosophical reflection. Theseus���s journey evolves into a meditation on existence, the role of technology, and the eternal quest for knowledge.
The heart of the Beta Zero Mechanism, the Alpha Crystal, becomes a symbol of the unending pursuit of understanding, shaping the Ankyran ethos and guiding their evolution. Theseus, transformed by his experiences in Ankyra's embrace, continues his odyssey, a journey through space and understanding, where the mysteries of the universe beckon and the quest for knowledge knows no end.
In "Lambiscopolix Whispers," the journey of Theseus becomes a symphony of exploration and revelation, a dance of stars and intellect in the boundless expanse of the Lambiscopolix.
This Nuspeak prose rendition maintains the essence and themes of the original poem while transforming its structure into a more narrative, prose-like format, resonating with the conceptual depth of the Ankyran universe.
