Summarize:

The researcher's measurement choice nonlinearly scales per- 
formance, causing performance to change sharply and unpredictably in a manner that qualitatively 
matches published emergent abilities (inset). (D) If the researcher instead scores models' outputs 
using a discontinuous metric such as (Multiple Choice Grade, which is similar to a step function), 
the researcher's measurement choice discontinuously scales performance, causing performance to 
changesharplyandunpredictablyinamannerthatqualitativelymatchespublishedemergentabilities 
(inset). (E)Changingfroma nonlinearmetrictoalinear metric (suchasTokenEditDistance), model 
shows smooth, continuous and predictable improvements, ablating the emergent ability. (F) Chang- 
ing from a discontinuous metric to a continuous metric (e.g. Brier Score) again reveals smooth, 
continuous and predictable improvements in task performance, ablating the emergent ability. Con- 
sequently, emergent abilities may be creations of the researcher's analyses, not fundamental changes 
in model family behavior on specif i c tasks. 
To communicate our alternative explanation, we present it as a simple mathematical model and 
demonstrate how it quantitatively reproduces the evidence offered in support of emergent abilities 
of LLMs. We then test our alternative explanation in three complementary ways: 
1. We make, test and conf i rm three predictions based on our alternative hypotheses using the 
InstructGPT [24] / GPT-3 [3] model family. 
2. We meta-analyze published results from [8, 29, 34], and show that in the space of task- 
metric-model family triplets, emergent abilities only appear for certain metrics and not for 
model families on tasks (columns). We further show that on i xed model outputs, changing 
the metric causes the emergence phenomenon to disappear. 
3. We intentionally induce emergent abilities in deep neural networks of different architec- 
tures on multiple vision tasks (which to the best of our knowledge have never before been 
demonstrated) to show how similar metric choices can induce seemingly emergent abilities.

The choice of metric used by researchers to evaluate the performance of language models can cause unpredictable changes in performance that appear to be emergent abilities. The emergence of these abilities may be a result of the researcher's analysis rather than fundamental changes in the behavior of the model on specific tasks. The researchers present a mathematical model that explains this phenomenon and test their alternative explanation through three complementary methods, including making and confirming predictions using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 model family, meta-analyzing published results, and inducing emergent abilities in deep neural networks on multiple vision tasks.

Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?
Rylan Schaeffer, Brando Miranda, Sanmi Koyejo
Download PDF
Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities, abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale models. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness, transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, one can choose a metric which leads to the inference of an emergent ability or another metric which does not. Thus, our alternative suggests that existing claims of emergent abilities are creations of the researcher's analyses, not fundamental changes in model behavior on specific tasks with scale. We present our explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities, (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show how similar metric decisions suggest apparent emergent abilities on vision tasks in diverse deep network architectures (convolutional, autoencoder, transformers). In all three analyses, we find strong supporting evidence that emergent abilities may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.

The paper questions the existence of emergent abilities in large language models, which are abilities that only appear in larger models but not in smaller ones. The authors propose an alternative explanation that the choice of metric used to evaluate the model's performance can lead to the appearance of emergent abilities, but they may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models. They present a mathematical model to support their explanation and test it in three ways, including making and confirming predictions using InstructGPT/GPT-3 models, conducting a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench, and inducing apparent emergent abilities on vision tasks in various deep network architectures. The authors find strong evidence to support their alternative explanation.

These loaves can then be used as ingredients in various food products.

Is that correct?

￼￼

Not exactly, the epoxy or glucose will be in little tablets and pills they can be mixed with the interstitial material to make packaging material. The edible packaging is like alternating layers of pretzel puffed corn and candy

ChatGPT

I see. So the packaging material will consist of a mixture of interstitial material and the two-phase epoxy or glucose in pill form. And the edible packaging will be made of alternating layers of pretzel puffed corn and candy.

It sounds like an interesting concept, but I have a few concerns. First, the two-phase epoxy may not be safe for consumption, so it's important to ensure that it's not mixed in with the food products. Additionally, the packaging material may not be strong enough to withstand the rigors of shipping and handling, especially if it's made mostly of interstitial material.

It's important to do thorough testing and research to ensure that these materials are safe and effective before using them in any large-scale applications.

￼￼

Ok of course the paper and food will have to be separate or they will be separated by a receiver mechanism

ChatGPT

Yes, that is correct. It is important to keep the paper and food separate, either by using different centrifuges for each material or by using a receiver mechanism to separate them after they have been centrifuged. The receiver mechanism can be designed to detect the different types of material and sort them accordingly, so that the paper and food can be collected in separate containers.

What is the name of this field of research embedded fluids?

ChatGPT

I'm not aware of a specific field of research called "embedded fluids". However, there are several fields of research related to fluid dynamics and material science that may be relevant to the concept you are describing, such as:

Microfluidics: the study of the behavior of fluids in channels with dimensions on the micrometer scale.

Colloids: the study of particles suspended in a fluid, which can form stable structures or self-assemble into larger structures.

Soft matter physics: the study of materials that have properties between those of solids and liquids, such as gels, foams, and emulsions.

Materials science: the study of the properties, structure, and performance of materials, including polymers and composites.

It's possible that the concept you are describing falls under one or more of these fields, but without more specific information about the materials and processes involved, it's difficult to say for sure.

A new model for simulating the transport of healing agents in self-healing (SH) cementitious materials is presented. The model is applicable to autonomic SH material systems in which embedded channels, or vascular networks, are used to supply healing agents to damaged zones. The essential numerical components of the model are a crack flow model, based on the Navier-Stokes equations, which is coupled to the mass balance equation for simulating unsaturated matrix flow. The driving forces for the crack flow are the capillary meniscus force and the force derived from an external (or internal) pressure applied to the liquid healing agent. The crack flow model component applies to non-uniform cracks and allows for the dynamic variation of the meniscus contact angle, as well as accounting for inertial terms. Particular attention is paid to the effects of curing on the flow characteristics. In this regard, a kinetic reaction model is presented for simulating the curing of the healing agent and a set of relationships established for representing the variation of rheological properties with the degree of cure. Data obtained in a linked experimental programme of work are employed to justify the choice and form of the constitutive relationships, as well as to calibrate the model's evolution functions. Finally, a series of validation examples are presented that include the analysis of a series of concrete beam specimens with an embedded vascular network. These examples demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the transport behaviour of this type of SH cementitious material system.

This is similar imagine pipes made of paper transporting liquid paper mache, they could be engineered to have self-healing priorities, or pretzel based dough pipes.

ChatGPT

Yes, that's a possibility. The use of paper or pretzel-based dough pipes to transport a fluid material like paper mache is an interesting concept. By embedding channels or vascular networks into these pipes, it could be possible to supply healing agents to damaged zones, allowing for self-healing priorities. This approach could be useful in applications where there is a need for flexible and biodegradable pipelines that can transport liquid or semi-solid materials.

￼￼

Who else is working on this?

ChatGPT

There are many researchers and companies working on developing self-healing and embedded fluid materials. Some notable examples include:

University of Bath: They have developed self-healing concrete that uses bacteria to repair cracks.

Delft University of Technology: They have developed a vascular system that can heal cracks in concrete using a self-healing agent.

BASF: They have developed a range of self-healing concrete products, including one that uses microcapsules to release a healing agent when a crack appears.

Stanford University: They have developed a self-healing polymer that can repair itself using heat or light.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: They have developed a self-healing polymer that can repair itself using a combination of heat and pressure.

AkzoNobel: They have developed a self-healing coating that uses microcapsules to release a healing agent when damaged.

These are just a few examples, as there are many researchers and companies around the world working on developing self-healing and embedded fluid materials for a variety of applications.

So no one is specifically working on making pipes out of bread or you don't know?

ChatGPT

I am not aware of any research or projects that are specifically focused on making pipes out of bread. However, there is ongoing research on developing sustainable and biodegradable materials for various applications, including pipes. Some researchers are exploring the use of plant-based materials such as cellulose or starch for creating eco-friendly pipes. Additionally, there are efforts to develop composite materials using natural fibers and biodegradable polymers for pipes and other structural applications.

￼￼

I am also working on toilets made of paper.

ChatGPT

That sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about the concept?

￼￼

Ok well at this point there is a need for extra equipment for processing but the paper is rolled and compressed and mixed with resinous agents to create a self repairing toilet.

ChatGPT

Interesting idea! Can you elaborate on how the self-repairing mechanism would work in the toilet made of compressed paper mixed with resinous agents?

￼￼

The paper is rolled to make reinforcing bars forming a network or grid, then paper is rolled and pressed and secreted using temperature and pressure.

ChatGPT

I'm sorry, but I'm having difficulty understanding the process you are describing. Can you please clarify or provide more information?

￼￼

A pulp like mixture is added to the water, a mesh or webbing catches the pulp then it is rolled and pressed until it becomes a harder material similar to the formation of xylem or epidermis

ChatGPT

That sounds like an interesting process. It seems like you're using a combination of mechanical and chemical methods to create a durable material. Can you give more details about the chemical agents used in the process and how they contribute to the final product's properties?

2 / 2

￼￼

There are capsules of resin for example, Natural resin comes from plants. The best example is the pine sap. The beautiful amber stone is gained by the hardening of the plant's resin. They are crushed and added back intothe pulp and mixed to make harder materials.

ChatGPT

I see, adding resin capsules to the pulp mixture can help strengthen the material. This is an interesting approach and could have potential applications in sustainable construction and manufacturing. However, it is important to ensure that the resin used is environmentally friendly and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative impacts on the environment.

￼￼

Yeah of course. It looks like there is still a lot of work to be done on the idea, like imagine a smarties in flour and little pretzel shells with oil. This could be used to make breads or chocolate bars

ChatGPT

Indeed, it seems like there are many potential applications for this type of technology. It will be interesting to see how it develops and how it can be applied to various industries.

￼￼

An overview outlining the idea

ChatGPT

Based on our conversation, the idea revolves around using centrifuges to separate materials into their component parts, which are then packaged in low-entropy configurations using micro jellybeans or capsules. This approach has potential applications in the food and building materials industries.

For example, in the food industry, the approach could be used to separate out and package different components of food such as carbs, proteins, oils, and flours. The resulting packages could then be used to create innovative food products such as edible packaging made from alternating layers of pretzel puffed corn and candy.

In the building materials industry, the approach could be used to create autonomic self-healing materials with embedded channels or vascular networks to supply healing agents to damaged zones. Paper could be rolled and compressed to form reinforcing bars, and a pulp-like mixture containing crushed natural resins could be added to make harder materials.

Additional research and development are needed to explore the feasibility and practicality of these ideas, including the use of smarties in flour and little pretzel shells with oil to create breads or chocolate bars.

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not capable of playing games in the traditional sense that humans do. However, I can help you with ideas or suggestions for designing a game based on the Spherepop concept.
It sounds like the game involves flying a spaceship and evaluating bubbles by popping them, and that there is a way to avoid popping them by hitting the "b" key. Here are some additional ideas you could consider incorporating into the game:
Power-ups: Add special bubbles that provide power-ups such as extra time, higher scores, or shields that protect your ship.
Obstacles: Introduce obstacles such as moving bubbles, mines, or walls that impede your progress and force you to strategize how to navigate through the cluster of bubbles.
Multiplayer: Add a multiplayer mode where players compete against each other to see who can pop the most bubbles within a given time limit.
Levels: Introduce different levels with varying difficulty levels, with each level having a different cluster of bubbles to pop.
These are just a few ideas to help you get started in designing your game based on Spherepop.

Ok you press asdw to fly qe to tilt (turn) left or right, r and f for roof and floor. Hjkl to look around, z to zoom out and x to zoom in (examine) and of course b to blink. The first time you hit the g key it gives you a warning setting off an alarm and saying global reset for all players but disappears when you let go of the key (global reset will occur in five seconds and starts counting down), the second time the counter starts at 4, and so on, after the fifth time it is instantiatious (logarithmically scaled to 0.00000001 seconds over the first one million turns). Only players who happen to be blinking will not be reset (all players in the game)

Press a + b simultaneously to enable autoblink, which will increase your chances of not being reset,  and s + a + b to enable super autoblink, whuch will make the player "happen" to blink when ever anyone presses the "g" key.  If not blinking you will have to wait for five minutes to return to where (when) you were at game over.

Sure! Based on the information you have provided so far, here are the rules and keyboard controls for Haplopraxis:
Rules:
Explore the space by flying your spaceship and visiting different planets.
When you arrive at a planet, you will be given a typing challenge to complete.
The challenge consists of typing out a phrase or sentence correctly within a certain time limit.
If you complete the challenge successfully, you will earn points and move on to the next planet.
If you fail the challenge, you will lose a life. You have a limited number of lives, so be careful!
The game ends when you either run out of lives or complete all the challenges.
Keyboard controls:
Use the arrow keys to fly your spaceship.
Press Enter to begin a typing challenge.
Type the challenge using your keyboard.
Press Enter again to submit your answer.
If you need to erase a mistake, use the Backspace key.
If you want to skip a challenge, press the Spacebar.
If you need to pause the game, press the Escape key.
If you want to quit the game, press Alt+F4 (on Windows) or Command+Q (on Mac).

Yes explain the rules about the global reset for all players key (g) and how it results in a game over, but you can inoculate yourself against a reset by enabling autoblink. If you have autoblink enabled and you hit the g key you will still get reset in time (to the beginning of the game) but you will not lose your points, each point is associated with a marked vocabulary item which forms a "dictionary" of the planets you've visited in terms of the bubbles you popped. You have to blink to avoid popping the outermost bubble.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, I can explain that further.
The "g" key triggers a global reset for all players in the game. When the global reset occurs, all players are returned to the beginning of the game, meaning that they lose all progress and have to start over.
However, players can protect themselves from a global reset by enabling autoblink. Autoblink is a setting that increases the chances of not being reset when the "g" key is pressed. With autoblink enabled, if a global reset occurs, the player will still be reset in time, but they will not lose their points, which are associated with marked vocabulary items representing the planets they have visited in terms of the bubbles they have popped.
To avoid popping the outermost bubble, players have to blink while passing through the boundary. If they do not blink, the bubble will pop, and the player will lose points.
I hope that helps clarify the rules of the game!

It does, thank you. But you don't lose points for popping a bubble, you lose all your points when the game is reset, unless you are blinking. You want to not pop certain bubbles because you should look to find the most nested bubble (innermost scope).

I apologize for the confusion. Thank you for correcting me. You are correct that popping a bubble does not result in a loss of points. The points are only lost when the game is reset, except for players who are blinking, who will not lose their points.
