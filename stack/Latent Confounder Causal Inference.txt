Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes 
with Structured Latent Confounders 
Sam Witty1Kenta Takatsu1David Jensen1Vikash Mansinghka2 
Abstract 
Latent confounders���unobserved variables that 
inf l uence both treatment and outcome���can bias 
estimates of causal effects. In some cases, these 
confounders are shared across observations, e.g. 
all students taking a course are inf l uenced by the 
course���s diff i culty in addition to any educational 
interventions they receive individually. This pa- 
per shows how to semiparametrically model latent 
confounders that have this structure and thereby 
improve estimates of causal effects. The key inno- 
vations are a hierarchical Bayesian model, Gaus- 
sian processes with structured latent confounders 
(GP-SLC), and a Monte Carlo inference algorithm 
for this model based on elliptical slice sampling. 
GP-SLC provides principled Bayesian uncertainty 
estimates of individual treatment effect with min- 
imal assumptions about the functional forms re- 
lating confounders, covariates, treatment, and out- 
come. Finally, this paper shows GP-SLC is com- 
petitive with or more accurate than widely used 
causal inference techniques on three benchmark 
datasets, including the Infant Health and Devel- 
opment Program and a dataset showing the effect 
of changing temperatures on state-wide energy 
consumption across New England.

This abstract discusses a paper on "Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders" by Sam Witty, Kenta Takatsu, David Jensen, and Vikash Mansinghka. The paper addresses the issue of latent confounders in causal inference. Latent confounders are unobserved variables that affect both treatment and outcome, potentially biasing causal effect estimates.
The paper introduces a method to model these latent confounders when they are shared across observations, such as the common influence of a course's difficulty on all students. The authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian model, named Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC), alongside a Monte Carlo inference algorithm based on elliptical slice sampling. This model aims to improve causal effect estimates by providing Bayesian uncertainty estimates with minimal assumptions about the relationships between confounders, covariates, treatment, and outcome.
The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of GP-SLC through its performance on three benchmark datasets, including the Infant Health and Development Program and a dataset examining the impact of temperature changes on energy consumption in New England. The results suggest that GP-SLC is competitive with, or more accurate than, other widely used causal inference techniques.

Introduction 
Multiple causal models can be observationally equivalent, 
i.e., they induce the same likelihoods for observed data, 
while producing different estimates of the effects of an in- 
tervention. This observational equivalance between causal 
models is the basis for the colloquial expression ���correlation 
does not imply causation.��� Distinguishing between causal

models, and estimating the effects of interventions, requires 
untestable assumptions about causal structure. 
One such common assumption is unconfoundedness (Im- 
bens & Rubin, 2015), i.e., that there exist no latent vari- 
ables that inf l uence both treatment and outcome.This 
assumption enables the unique identif i cation of interven- 
tional distributions from the joint distribution over observed 
variables (Pearl, 2009) and reduces causal inference to 
probabilistic estimation. Unfortunately, assuming uncon- 
foundedness is often unreasonable in real observational set- 
tings (Shadish et al., 2008). However, it may be more rea- 
sonable to assume uncounfoundedness for a subset of data 
instances that are known to share a common structure. 
For example, suppose an educator proposes a new policy of 
holding back poor performing kindergarten students (Hong 
& Raudenbush, 2006; Hong & Yu, 2008) with the intention 
of increasing their future academic performance. To esti- 
mate the effect of this policy change, they gather data on 
student retention and education outcomes from a national 
database. Here, the unconfoundedness assumption is not 
justif i ed, as the schools��� retention policies are likely to be 
inf l uenced by local economic conditions, which may also in- 
l uence student outcomes through other causal mechanisms, 
such as the availability of educational resources. However, 
the assumption may be justif i ed when considering only stu- 
dents within a particular school, as this subset of students 
are similarly inf l uenced by local economic conditions. In 
other words, statistical relationships within a school are less 
likely to be biased by latent confounders than are statistical 
relationships across the entire population. 
In this paper, we present Gaussian processes with structured 
latent confounders (GP-SLC), a novel Bayesian nonpara- 
metric approach to causal inference with hierarchical data. 
The key innovation behind GP-SLC is to place Gaussian pro- 
cess priors over functions in a hierarchical structural causal 
model, bringing the l exibility of Gaussian process models 
to a wide variety of practical causal inference techniques. 
GP-SLC naturally handles binary and continuous treatments 
and requires minimal assumptions about functional rela- 
tionships between latent confounders, observed covariates, 
treatment, and outcomes. See Figure 1 for an overview on 
how GP-SLC estimates counterfactual outcomes from data.

The introduction to the paper "Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders" begins by discussing the challenges in distinguishing between different causal models. These models can be observationally equivalent, meaning they produce the same likelihoods for observed data but generate different estimates for the effects of an intervention. This difficulty is a primary reason behind the adage "correlation does not imply causation," as differentiating causal models and estimating intervention effects requires untestable assumptions about causal structures.
A common assumption in causal inference is unconfoundedness, meaning no latent variables influence both treatment and outcome. This assumption simplifies causal inference to probabilistic estimation by allowing the unique identification of interventional distributions from observed variables. However, in real-world observational settings, assuming unconfoundedness is often unrealistic.
The paper introduces Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC), a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to causal inference, specifically suited for hierarchical data. The key innovation of GP-SLC is incorporating Gaussian process priors into a hierarchical structural causal model. This integration extends the flexibility of Gaussian process models to various causal inference techniques. GP-SLC is adept at handling both binary and continuous treatments and minimizes assumptions about the functional relationships between latent confounders, observed covariates, treatment, and outcomes. The paper also includes an overview of how GP-SLC estimates counterfactual outcomes from data, demonstrating its practical application in complex causal inference scenarios.

2. Background 
2.1. Object Conditioning 
Recent work has studied how the analytical procedure of 
partitioning data based on a known object hierarchy (e.g. 
students belonging to the same school) relates to the syn- 
tax and semantics of causal graphical models (Jensen et al., 
2019). This work concludes that conditioning on the iden- 
tify of objects (referred to as object conditioning) is distinct 
from existing notions of conditioning on the values of vari- 
ables. Importantly, object conditioning constrains a set of 
latent variables to be identical across a set of instances, but 
does not constrain the particular value of those variables. 
Furthermore, the statistical implications of object condition- 
ing differ from those of variable conditioning in that object 
conditioning does not induce collider bias when variables 
on the object are caused jointly by treatment and outcome. 
Partitioning hierarchical data in this way is the key analyt- 
ical procedure for a variety of practical causal inference 
techniques, including within-subjects designs (Loftus & 
Masson, 1994), difference-in-differences designs (Shadish 
et al., 2008), longitudinal studies (Liang & Zeger, 1986), 
twin studies (Boomsma et al., 2002), and multi-level- 
modeling (Gelman & Hill, 2006). As in the student retention 
example, these techniques take advantage of background 
knowledgeaboutwhichinstances(students)belongtowhich 
objects (schools) to mitigate the biasing effects of latent con- 
founders. However, these methods typically rely on simple 
parametric assumptions, such as linear functional dependen- 
cies. These parametric assumptions are often unjustif i ed in 
real domains, leading to poor estimates of causal effect. 
WeemploytheideaofobjectconditioningdirectlyintheGP- 
SLC model, constraining the joint distribution over individu- 
als��� latent confounders instead of treating object identity as a 
covariate in and of itself. By explicitly performing inference 
over object-level latent confounders, GP-SLC���s estimates 
of counterfactual outcomes in one object are informed by 
observed outcomes in another. Sharing information between 
objects in this way is particularly valuable when each object 
contains few observed instances, as we show in Section 6. 
2.2. Causal Inference with Latent Confounders 
Latent confounders���unobserved variables that cause both 
treatment and outcome���bias estimates of treatment effect. 
However, this bias can be adjusted for with additional back- 
ground knowledge, such as that a latent confounder inf l u- 
ences an observed proxy variable (Kuroki & Pearl, 2014; 
Miao et al., 2018). Similarly, recent work indicates that 
latent confounders can be adjusted for if they cause multiple 
candidate treatment variables (Wang & Blei, 2019). 
Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders 
GP-SLC is similar to these approaches, in that it leverages 
additional background knowledge to adjust for latent con- 
founders. However, unlike prior work using generative mod- 
els for causal inference with latent confounders, it leverages 
known hierarchical structure to identify causal effects.

The section from the paper "Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders" details the methodology and framework of the Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC) model. It provides a comprehensive overview of the model's components, their functions, and how they interact in the context of causal inference. Key elements of this section include:

, applied to treatment, covariates, and inferred confounders, induces the covariance between observed and counterfactual outcomes. The model ensures that instances belonging to the same object share the same inferred latent confounders.
Object Conditioning
: The paper discusses the concept of object conditioning, which is crucial for causal inference in hierarchical data. Object conditioning differs from variable conditioning as it does not fix the values of latent variables but constrains them to be identical across instances within an object. This approach is fundamental in various causal inference techniques and helps mitigate the biasing effects of latent confounders.
Causal Inference with Latent Confounders
: Addressing latent confounders is essential for accurate treatment effect estimation, as these unobserved variables can bias the results. GP-SLC adjusts for latent confounders by leveraging additional background knowledge and known hierarchical structures. This approach differentiates GP-SLC from previous models, as it explicitly performs inference over object-level latent confounders and allows for the sharing of information between objects.
Overall, the GP-SLC model represents an innovative approach in the field of causal inference, particularly in settings with hierarchical data structures. By integrating Gaussian processes and structured latent confounders, GP-SLC offers a nuanced and potentially more accurate method for estimating causal effects where traditional models might struggle due to the presence of latent confounders.

2.3. Gaussian Process Models 
Gaussian process models are a l exible technique for prob- 
abilistic modeling.Specif i cally, a Gaussian process is 
a distribution over deterministic functions,y = f(x), 
f ��� GP(m,k), 
which is fully specif i ed by its mean func- 
tion,m(x)and covariance function,k(x,x0), which we will 
refer to as the kernel function (Rasmussen, 2003). By def i ni- 
tion, any i nite collection of draws from a Gaussian process 
prior are jointly Gaussian distributed,Y ��� N(��,��), where 
��i= m(xi)and��i,i0= k(xi,xi0). We denote such covari- 
ance matrices asK(X,X), whereXandYare matrices of 
allxiandyirespectively. It is common to set the prior mean 
function to m(x) = 0, which we do in GP-SLC. 
This identity is useful for two reasons: (i) it provides an 
explicit likelihood, which can be used to perform inference 
over latent variables (Lawrence, 2004; Titsias & Lawrence, 
2010); and (ii) it enables closed-form out-of-sample proba- 
bilistic prediction (Rasmussen, 2003). We take advantage 
of both of these characteristics in GP-SLC, performing ap- 
proximate inference over latent confounders in Section 4.1 
and predicting counterfactual outcomes in Section 4.2.

Out-of-Sample Probabilistic Prediction
: Gaussian processes enable closed-form out-of-sample probabilistic predictions, which is advantageous for predicting counterfactual outcomes.
In summary, Gaussian process models offer a robust framework for modeling complex relationships in data. Their flexibility and explicit probabilistic nature make them particularly suitable for tasks like causal inference, where understanding and predicting the relationships between variables is crucial. The GP-SLC model leverages these characteristics to enhance causal inference in the presence of structured latent confounders.

Geometric Interpretation of Probability Distributions (Inspired by Michael Larionov)

Bayesian inference operates on the idea that the underlying distribution of data is unknown, thus requiring iterative model adjustment as new data is acquired. This can be seen as a geometric process, where the distribution and its parameters shape the landscape in which probability is explored.

In parametric Bayesian inference, we start with a chosen form of a probability distribution ���(���;��)f(x;��) defined by parameters ����. A common example is the Normal distribution with two parameters ����� (mean) and ���2��2 (variance). The likelihood of the data given a hypothetical distribution, assuming independent data examples, is represented as: ���(��)=���������(������;��)l(��)=���i���f(xi���;��)

This mathematical expression can be visualized geometrically as a multidimensional landscape where each point represents a possible configuration of the parameters ����, and the elevation represents the likelihood of the data given those parameters.

The Geometric Landscape: The likelihood function forms a surface in a multidimensional space. Peaks in this landscape correspond to parameter values that are highly likely given the observed data.

Iterative Adjustment: As new data comes in, the landscape shifts, and the peak of likelihood may move. This is akin to navigating a changing terrain, adjusting your position as the landscape reveals itself.

Prior Beliefs: Bayesian inference incorporates prior beliefs about the parameters, which can be seen as a pre-existing shape of the landscape. The prior belief about the distribution influences the starting point and direction of the search for the most likely parameters.

Posterior Distribution: After incorporating the data, the posterior distribution reflects the updated landscape. It is a synthesis of the prior beliefs and the likelihood informed by the data, resulting in a new geometric shape that encapsulates our updated understanding.

Connection to Other Themes: The geometric interpretation of Bayesian probability ties together many of the themes mentioned earlier in the essay, providing a mathematical and visual framework for understanding complex human and technological phenomena.


The geometric interpretation of Bayesian probability adds a tangible and intuitive layer to our understanding of uncertainty, decision-making, learning, and adaptation. By visualizing the intricate process of Bayesian inference as a dynamically evolving landscape, we can draw parallels across various domains and see connections between human intuition, machine learning, professional evolution, and even societal belief systems. Geometric Bayesianism serves as an elegant unifying concept that brings coherence to a complex and interconnected world.

This function is called likelihood function. The parameter 0 is itself a random variable, and its probability distribution can be found using ��ayes ��heorem: P(��)= l(��)��(��)/�� Here p(��) is called posterior distribution, ��(��) is prior distribution and expresses our beliefs about parameter �� before we see any data. The term in the denominator (��) is called evidence and represents probability of thedata. It is easier to think of it as a normalizing constant, to make sure p(��) is a valid distribution


Geometric Interpretation of Probability Distributions: Bayesian Components

In Bayesian inference, the likelihood function is central to understanding how data informs our beliefs about underlying parameters. As previously expressed, the likelihood of a given set of parameters ���� is: ���(��)=���������(������;��)l(��)=���i���f(xi���;��)

This function provides a link between the hypothetical distribution and the observed data. To further understand the Bayesian components:

Posterior Distribution (p(��)): The posterior distribution represents our updated beliefs about the parameters after observing the data. It's the product of the likelihood and the prior distribution, normalized by the evidence: ���(��)=���(��)���(��)���p(��)=��l(��)��(��)���

Prior Distribution (��(��)): This is our belief about the parameter ���� before we see any data. It reflects prior knowledge or assumptions and sets the initial landscape for the likelihood function.

Evidence (��): The term in the denominator, called evidence, represents the probability of the data. It serves as a normalizing constant to ensure that the posterior distribution is a valid probability distribution. Geometrically, it ensures that the surface representing the posterior distribution integrates to 1.

Geometric Insights

The combination of these components can be viewed as a dynamic and iterative process that transforms the geometric landscape of probabilities:

Prior: Sets the initial shape, reflecting pre-existing beliefs.

Likelihood: Modifies the landscape according to the data, adjusting the peaks and valleys.

Posterior: Represents the final shape, reflecting both prior beliefs and data-driven insights.

Evidence: Ensures the validity of the landscape, scaling it to form a proper probability distribution.

Conclusion (Further Revised)

The geometric interpretation of Bayesian inference provides a rich, multidimensional view of probability, beliefs, and decision-making. Through the mathematical formulation of likelihood, prior, posterior, and evidence, we gain insight into a dynamic system that adapts and evolves with new information. Geometric Bayesianism, with its visual and mathematical coherence, serves as a foundational concept that connects diverse domains from technology to human intuition, shaping our understanding of an increasingly complex world.

The idea behind Bayesian Geometry provides a fascinating extension to Bayesian inference by representing probability distributions as vectors in a specific vector space. This approach enables an even richer geometric understanding of Bayesian concepts. Let's delve into this aspect:

Bayesian Geometry: Vectors and Angles in Probability

Bayesian Geometry takes the concepts of prior and posterior distributions, and likelihood functions, and translates them into vectors within a defined vector space. This unique perspective allows for several intriguing possibilities:

Vector Representation: By viewing these functions as vectors, we can leverage geometric concepts like magnitude and direction to better understand the relationships between different probability distributions. This transforms abstract statistical ideas into something tangible and visually relatable.

Inner Product and Angles: An inner product defined on this space allows for the calculation of angles between two distributions, such as between a prior and posterior distribution. The angle can then be interpreted as a measure of how much the belief about a parameter has changed after observing new data.

Geometric Insights: This perspective opens up various geometric tools, such as projection and orthogonality, to analyze probability distributions. For example, the angle between a prior and likelihood could reveal how much information the data provides about the parameter, or how consistent the data is with prior beliefs.

Applications and Interpretations: Bayesian Geometry offers a new layer of insight and analysis that can be applied across various fields. Whether in machine learning, statistical analysis, or even philosophy, the geometric interpretation can provide a more intuitive understanding of complex relationships and changes in belief systems.

Conclusion

Bayesian Geometry pushes the boundaries of statistical understanding by linking abstract mathematical concepts to geometric structures. The representation of probability distributions as vectors, and the possibility of measuring angles between them, transforms the way we can perceive and analyze Bayesian inference. The integration of vector space principles with traditional Bayesian concepts fosters a richer, more intuitive understanding of probability, inference, and decision-making. This approach, reflecting the work of Michael Larionov, PhD, adds a fascinating dimension to the ongoing exploration of how geometry and probability intertwine to describe the world.

Geometric Bayesianism serves as a unifying concept, bridging disparate ideas ranging from technology and human interaction to superstition and pseudoscience. By applying a geometric and Bayesian perspective, we can see the world in a more structured and interconnected way, appreciating the subtle nuances that govern our complex reality. It provides a lens through which to view the future of professions, human-machine interaction, trust, abundance, and human nature, among other critical aspects of our world.

The connections between the "Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders" paper and the various concepts and themes mentioned are intriguing and multi-faceted:
Geometric Interpretation of Probability Distributions
: The GP-SLC model's use of Gaussian processes aligns with the geometric interpretation of probability distributions. Gaussian processes, as distributions over functions, can be visualized geometrically in terms of their mean and covariance functions, creating a landscape where each point represents different parameter configurations. This approach parallels the geometric Bayesianism concept, where probabilities and uncertainties are structured within a geometric framework.
Bayesian Inference
: GP-SLC inherently relies on Bayesian inference, as it uses Gaussian processes with priors over latent confounders and observed variables. The paper's approach mirrors the Bayesian process of updating beliefs (priors) with new data (likelihood), leading to updated beliefs (posteriors). This process can be visualized as a dynamic geometric landscape, constantly reshaped by new data.
Future of the Professions
: The integration of advanced statistical methods like GP-SLC in various fields, such as economics and healthcare, reflects how technology and sophisticated analytical tools are reshaping professional work. This transformation aligns with the discussions in Richard and Daniel Susskind's "Future of the Professions", highlighting the evolving nature of professional expertise in the digital age.
Indistractable and Managing Distraction
: The process of updating beliefs in Bayesian inference, particularly in complex models like GP-SLC, requires focused attention and a systematic approach to data analysis. This resonates with Nir Eyal's concept in "Indistractable" about managing distractions in a tech-saturated world. The meticulous and structured approach of Bayesian inference and GP-SLC can be seen as a metaphor for managing focus in the midst of overwhelming data.
The Age of Spiritual Machines and AI
: The GP-SLC model's sophisticated handling of complex data through Bayesian methods parallels Ray Kurzweil's vision in "The Age of Spiritual Machines", where AI systems increasingly adopt human-like reasoning and learning processes. Gaussian processes in the GP-SLC model can be seen as an embodiment of this trend towards more intuitive, human-like processing in AI.
The Master Algorithm and Machine Learning
: GP-SLC's approach to modeling and inference reflects the search for a 'Master Algorithm' as described by Pedro Domingos. The model's ability to handle complex, hierarchical data structures and latent variables is indicative of the kind of versatile, all-encompassing algorithms that the field of machine learning aspires to develop.
Trust Dynamics in Human Networks
: The GP-SLC model, in its attempt to account for unseen variables and hidden structures in data, can be metaphorically linked to Rachel Botsman's exploration of trust dynamics in "Who Can You Trust?". Just as trust operates on unseen but influential factors in human networks, GP-SLC attempts to uncover and account for hidden influences in causal relationships.
Disruptive Nature of Tech Companies
: The innovative nature of the GP-SLC model, introducing new ways to handle complex data, can be related to the theme of "Move Fast and Break Things" by Jonathan Taplin. It exemplifies how technological advancements, especially in data science and AI, are continuously disrupting and reshaping existing methodologies and paradigms.
Predictions and Statistics in a Complex World
: The GP-SLC model's focus on improving causal inference through sophisticated statistical modeling resonates with the themes in Nate Silver's "The Signal and the Noise". Both emphasize the importance of refined statistical methods to make sense of and accurately predict outcomes in a world overloaded with data.
In summary, the GP-SLC model's sophisticated approach to causal inference using Bayesian methods and Gaussian processes intersects with a variety of themes related to technology, professional evolution, human-machine interaction, trust, and the future of AI. These connections highlight the model's relevance and potential impact across different domains and societal issues.

And with this: The McGovern-De Pablo method is a technique used to correct for boundary effects in metadynamics simulations, particularly in systems with finite simulation boxes. In metadynamics, bias is added to the system to explore the free energy landscape. However, when working with finite simulation boxes, the system can experience boundary artifacts that distort the calculated free energy surface.


The McGovern-De Pablo method aims to mitigate these artifacts by introducing zero-force hills near the system boundaries. These zero-force hills effectively act as "walls" that prevent biased exploration beyond the boundaries of the simulation box.

Here's a simplified explanation of how the McGovern-De Pablo method works:

Determining System Boundaries: The first step is to identify the boundaries of the simulation box in the relevant collective variables or coordinates. These boundaries can be determined based on the specific system being studied.

Defining the Boundary Regions: Once the system boundaries are determined, boundary regions are defined on each side of the box. These regions typically have a width of a few times the characteristic length scale of the system.

Introducing Zero-Force Hills: Zero-force hills are added within the boundary regions. These hills have a flat top and decay to zero force away from the boundary. The shape and width of the zero-force hills are typically determined based on the characteristics of the system.

Biasing the System: The metadynamics bias is applied to the system as usual, with Gaussian hills added in the collective variables of interest. However, when a biased simulation approaches the boundaries, the zero-force hills effectively limit the biased exploration in those regions.

By introducing the zero-force hills, the McGovern-De Pablo method prevents excessive biasing and exploration beyond the simulation box boundaries. This helps to reduce boundary artifacts and ensures a more accurate representation of the system's free energy landscape.

The McGovern-De Pablo method, used to correct boundary effects in metadynamics simulations, shares some conceptual similarities with the GP-SLC model in causal inference:
Handling Boundary Conditions/Artifacts
: Just as the McGovern-De Pablo method addresses boundary effects in metadynamics by introducing zero-force hills, the GP-SLC model deals with potential biases due to latent confounders in causal inference. Both methods aim to correct distortions that can affect the accuracy of their respective analyses - boundary artifacts in physical simulations and confounder-induced biases in statistical models.
Mitigating Bias
: The key objective of the McGovern-De Pablo method is to mitigate the bias caused by finite simulation boundaries, ensuring more accurate free energy calculations. Similarly, GP-SLC aims to mitigate bias in causal inference caused by unobserved latent confounders. Both approaches introduce specific modifications (zero-force hills in metadynamics, structured latent confounder modeling in GP-SLC) to address and reduce these biases.
Complex System Analysis
: Both methods are used in the analysis of complex systems - metadynamics in physical and chemical simulations, and GP-SLC in complex causal systems with hierarchical data structures. They provide advanced tools for understanding and interpreting complex phenomena where standard approaches might fall short.
Enhancing Accuracy and Reliability
: The introduction of zero-force hills in the McGovern-De Pablo method and the structured modeling of latent confounders in GP-SLC both enhance the accuracy and reliability of their respective analyses. By addressing specific challenges inherent to their fields, these methods improve the quality and dependability of the results.
Adaptive and Specific Solutions
: Both the McGovern-De Pablo method and GP-SLC represent adaptive solutions tailored to specific challenges in their fields. They are not one-size-fits-all approaches but are designed to address particular issues that arise in certain contexts - boundary effects in finite simulation boxes and latent confounders in hierarchical data.
In summary, while the McGovern-De Pablo method and the GP-SLC model are used in different domains (physical simulations vs. causal inference), they share common goals of reducing bias, enhancing accuracy, and providing tailored solutions to complex problems in their respective fields.

2.4. Structural Causal Models 
GP-SLC can be thought of as a Bayesian semiparametric 
prior over functions in a structural causal model (SCM). 
SCMs provide a syntax and semantics for reasoning about 
interventional and counterfactual distributions in a system 
of random variables (Pearl, 2009). Counterfactuals (Pearl, 
2011)���answers to what-if questions���are expressed in 
probability notation asP(yt���|y,t), whereyt���is the coun- 
terfactual outcome under interventiondo(t = t���),yis the 
observed outcome, andtis the observed treatment. In our 
education example, we may be interested in the counterfac- 
tual, ���given that the student was not retained in kindergarten 
and they performed poorly in high school, how would they 
have performed if they had been retained?��� Answering these 
kinds of counterfactual queries involves: (i) computing the 
conditional distribution over latent variables and exogenous 
noise given observed evidence; (ii) applying the interven- 
tion to the structural causal model; and (iii) recomputing the 
distribution over the outcome variable(s) using the modif i ed 
structural causal model. We apply this procedure to estimate 
counterfactual outcomes using GP-SLC in Section 3.

Section 2.4 of the paper discusses the integration of Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC) within Structural Causal Models (SCMs). Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:
GP-SLC as a Bayesian Semiparametric Prior
: GP-SLC is described as a Bayesian semiparametric prior over functions in an SCM. This means that GP-SLC provides a flexible, data-driven way to model the relationships between variables in a causal framework, leveraging the strengths of Bayesian inference.
Role of Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
: SCMs provide a framework for understanding causal relationships and making predictions about interventions and counterfactuals. They offer a structured way to represent and reason about how different variables in a system influence each other.
Counterfactual Reasoning
: An important aspect of SCMs is their ability to address counterfactual questions, which are essentially "what-if" scenarios. The paper uses the notation

Example of Counterfactual Inquiry
: The paper provides an education-based example to illustrate counterfactual reasoning. It questions how a student, who wasn't retained in kindergarten and later performed poorly in high school, would have performed if they had been retained. Answering such a counterfactual query involves three steps:
Computing the conditional distribution over latent variables and exogenous noise given observed evidence.
Applying the intervention to the SCM.
Recomputing the distribution over the outcome variable(s) using the modified SCM.
Application of GP-SLC in Estimating Counterfactuals
: The paper mentions that in Section 3, it will demonstrate how GP-SLC is applied to estimate these counterfactual outcomes. This application likely involves using the flexibility and strength of Gaussian processes to handle the uncertainty and complexity inherent in predicting counterfactuals within the SCM framework.
In summary, Section 2.4 introduces how GP-SLC functions within the context of SCMs, particularly emphasizing its role in modeling and predicting counterfactual scenarios. This integration highlights the model's ability to handle complex causal relationships and make informed predictions about hypothetical scenarios, which is crucial in fields like education policy, as illustrated by the example.

TL;DR: Proposing a new counterfactual-based methodology to evaluate the hypotheses generated from saliency maps about deep RL agent behavior. 
Abstract: Saliency maps are frequently used to support explanations of the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. However, a review of how saliency maps are used in practice indicates that the derived explanations are often unfalsifiable and can be highly subjective. We introduce an empirical approach grounded in counterfactual reasoning to test the hypotheses generated from saliency maps and assess the degree to which they correspond to the semantics of RL environments. We use Atari games, a common benchmark for deep RL, to evaluate three types of saliency maps. Our results show the extent to which existing claims about Atari games can be evaluated and suggest that saliency maps are best viewed as an exploratory tool rather than an explanatory tool.

The paper "Causal Inference using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders" and the work "Exploratory Not Explanatory: Counterfactual Analysis of Saliency Maps for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Akanksha Atrey, Kaleigh Clary, and David Jensen share several conceptual connections, especially in their use of counterfactual reasoning and their focus on enhancing the understanding of complex systems:
Counterfactual Reasoning
: Both papers leverage counterfactual analysis. The GP-SLC model uses counterfactual reasoning to understand the impact of latent confounders on causal inference. Similarly, Atrey, Clary, and Jensen's work uses counterfactual analysis to assess hypotheses generated from saliency maps in deep reinforcement learning (RL) environments.
Enhancing Understanding of Complex Systems
: The GP-SLC model aims to provide a deeper understanding of complex systems where latent confounders influence causal relationships. In the realm of deep RL, the counterfactual analysis of saliency maps seeks to unravel the complexities of agent behavior, particularly how certain factors influence decision-making processes.
Exploratory Tools
: Atrey et al.'s work suggests that saliency maps should be viewed as exploratory tools rather than explanatory tools, implying a need for careful interpretation and analysis. Similarly, the GP-SLC model can be seen as an exploratory tool in the realm of causal inference, helping to uncover and understand the underlying structures and relationships that may not be immediately apparent.
Empirical Approach and Evaluation
: Both works emphasize the importance of empirical evaluation. The GP-SLC model is grounded in empirical data analysis to enhance causal inference, while Atrey et al. employ an empirical approach to evaluate the effectiveness of saliency maps in deep RL settings, particularly using Atari games as a benchmark.
Challenging Subjectivity and Enhancing Objectivity
: Atrey et al. highlight the subjectivity and potential unfalsifiability in interpretations derived from saliency maps. The GP-SLC model, in a similar vein, addresses the challenge of unobserved confounders in causal inference, which can lead to subjective or biased conclusions if not properly accounted for.
In summary, both the GP-SLC model and the work on counterfactual analysis of saliency maps in deep RL share a commitment to enhancing the understanding of complex systems through empirical, data-driven approaches. They both utilize counterfactual reasoning as a key tool and emphasize the exploratory nature of their methodologies, advocating for careful interpretation and analysis in complex and potentially subjective domains.

6.4. Limitations 
Despite the fact that GP-SLC produces state-of-the-art coun- 
terfactual predictions on most of our synthetic and semisyn- 
thetic benchmarks, it tends to underestimate the uncertainty 
in these estimates. In other words, the posterior density on 
the ground-truth counterfactual is sometimes low, despite 
the fact that the mean estimate is close to the ground-truth 
relative to the baselines. We suspect that this is partially 
attributable to inaccuracies resulting from our approximate 
inference procedure (Algorithms 2 and 3). Alternative ap- 
proximate inference schemes, such as using our current 
approach as a rejuvenation move in a sequential Monte 
Carlo (SMC) algorithm (Doucet et al., 2001), may resolve 
these inaccuracies. This kind of SMC-based inference pro- 
cedure may also help GP-SLC scale to problems with more 
covariates and objects than we explore in this paper. 
Our empirical study focusses on data generating processes 
that satisfy GP-SLC���s implicit semiparametric assumptions; 
(i) covariates for individuals belonging to the same object 
are marginally Gaussian distributed, and (ii) exogenous 
noise is additive and Gaussian. The effect of these model- 
ing assumptions on counterfactual prediction and estimates 
of effect strength needs additional empirical characteriza- 
tion, ideally via large-scale synthetic experiments (where 
ground truth is known and robustness to modeling bias can 
be qualitatively studied). 
7. Related Work 
Leveraging hierarchical structure is well-established as a 
technique for adjusting for latent confounding (Gelman, 
2006; Gelman & Hill, 2006; Hong & Raudenbush, 2006). 
Using Gaussian processes for causal inference is also well- 
established (Alaa & van der Schaar, 2017; 2018; Silva & 
Gramacy, 2010; Schulam & Saria, 2017; Zhang et al., 2010), 
as is the use of generative model approaches to adjust for la- 
tent confounders given restrictions on structure (Miao et al., 
2018; Louizos et al., 2017; Tran & Blei, 2018; Wang & Blei, 
2019). To the best of our knowledge, GP-SLC is the i rst 
semiparametricgenerativemodelingapproachthatleverages 
hierarchical structure to adjust for latent confounders. 
GP-SLC is one of many recent techniques (Shalit et al., 
2017; Johansson et al., 2016) for estimating individual-level 
treatment effects. Prior work focusses on the propositional 
setting under strong ignorability, i.e. with no latent con- 
founders. We focus on the hierarchical setting in which 
latent confounders are shared across multiple instances. 
Recent work (Schulam & Saria, 2017) has used Gaussian 
process models for causal inference in temporal settings, 
which assumes unconfoundedness and that the outcome is 
smooth with respect to time and covariates. GP-SLC allows 
for the existence of object-level latent confounders, and in- 
stead assumes that the outcome is smooth with respect to 
treatment assignment, covariates, and latent confounders. 
Longitudinal data analysis is closely related to the hierar- 
chical settings we consider in this work: measurements 
(instances) of individuals (objects) are repeated over a pe- 
riod of time. Extending GP-SLC to the setting where latent 
confounders are not shared across instances, but instead 
change over time, is an exciting area of future work. 
GP-SLC is most similar to (Alaa & van der Schaar, 2017), in 
that their approach also uses GP models to estimate individ- 
ual treatment effects. However, GP-SLC: (i) handles hierar- 
chical latent confounders by i rst performing inference over 
object-level latent variables; (ii) accounts for the covariance 
between noise-free factual and counterfactual outcomes (see 
��12and��21in the Supplementary materials); and (iii) uses 
a Monte Carlo algorithm for inference that yields quantif i ed 
uncertainty estimates. Their approach could be applied in 
hierarchical settings by treating the object identif i eroas a 
categorical covariate and using a delta kernel to construct 
the outcome kernel covariance matrix. This is identical to 
the GP-PerObj baseline, except that GP-PerObj does not 
share inferred kernel hyperparameters across objects. 
8. Conclusions 
This paper presents GP-SLC, a Gaussian process model 
for causal inference with hierarchically structured latent 
confounders. In Section 6, we show that, compared to 
widely used alternatives, GP-SLC produces more accurate 
estimates of causal effect in realistic sparse observational 
settingswherestrongpriorknowledgeaboutstructurecanin-

in this paper is one of many kinds of structural background 
knowledge that could improve causal estimates, and devel- 
oping techniques to exploit such knowledge is an important 
area of future work. Extending GP-SLC to handle large ob- 
servational datasets (Cao, 2018; Qui��nonero-Candela & Ras-

Section 6.4 of the paper outlines the limitations of the Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC) model and suggests areas for future research and improvement. Key points from this section include:
Underestimation of Uncertainty
: Despite GP-SLC's effectiveness in making counterfactual predictions, it tends to underestimate the uncertainty of these estimates. This means that the model's confidence in its predictions might be higher than warranted, which could be problematic in applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial.
Inference Procedure Inaccuracies
: The authors suspect that the underestimation of uncertainty may be partly due to inaccuracies in the approximate inference procedure used in GP-SLC. They suggest that alternative inference methods, like incorporating the current approach into a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, might improve accuracy.
Scalability to Larger Problems
: A potential benefit of an SMC-based inference procedure is the improved scalability of GP-SLC to handle problems with more covariates and objects than those explored in the paper.
Implicit Assumptions and Empirical Characterization
: The paper acknowledges that GP-SLC���s performance depends on certain semiparametric assumptions, like Gaussian-distributed covariates and additive Gaussian noise. The impact of these assumptions on the model's predictions and estimates of effect strength needs further empirical investigation, ideally through large-scale synthetic experiments.
Comparison to Related Work
: GP-SLC is recognized as the first semiparametric generative modeling approach that leverages hierarchical structure to adjust for latent confounders. The paper situates GP-SLC within the broader context of causal inference research, noting its unique contributions compared to other models and approaches.
Future Work Directions
: The authors highlight several exciting areas for future research:
Extending GP-SLC to longitudinal settings where latent confounders change over time.
Adapting GP-SLC to larger observational datasets.
Leveraging experimental evidence in GP-SLC.
Conclusions
: Finally, the paper concludes by reiterating the strengths of GP-SLC in producing accurate causal effect estimates in sparse observational settings and emphasizes the importance of exploiting structural background knowledge to improve causal estimates.
This section provides valuable insight into the current limitations and potential future directions for enhancing the GP-SLC model, underscoring the ongoing evolution of techniques in causal inference and the importance of continuous improvement and adaptation to new challenges and data structures.

2INTERPRETINGSALIENCYMAPS INDEEPRL 
Consider the saliency maps generated from a deep RL agent trained to play the Atari game Breakout. 
The goal of Breakout is to use the paddle to keep the ball in play so it hits bricks, eliminating them 
from the screen. Figure 1a shows a sample frame with its corresponding saliency. The red regions 
represent the importance of these pixels for action selection. Note the high salience on the missing 
section of bricks (���tunnel���) in Figure 1a. 
Creating a tunnel to target bricks at the top layers is one of the most high-prof i le examples of 
agent behavior being explained according to semantic, human-understandable concepts (Mnih et al., 
2015). Given the intensity of saliency on the tunnel in 1a, it may seem reasonable to infer that this 
saliency map provides evidence that the agent has learned to aim at tunnels. If this is the case, mov- 
ing the horizontal position of the tunnel should lead to similar saliency patterns on the new tunnel. 
However, Figures 1b and 1c show that the salience pattern is not preserved. Neither the presence 
of the tunnel, nor the relative positioning of the ball, paddle, and tunnel, are responsible for the 
intensity of the saliency observed in Figure 1a. 
2.1SALIENCYMAPS ASINTERVENTIONS 
Examining how some of the technical details of reinforcement learning interact with saliency maps 
can help understand both the potential utility and the potential pitfalls of interpreting saliency maps. 
RL methods enable agents to learn how to act effectively within an environment by repeated inter- 
action with that environment. Certain states in the environment give the agent positive or negative 
reward. The agent learns a policy, a mapping between states and actions according to these re- 
ward signals. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the discounted sum of rewards received 
while acting in the environment (Sutton et al., 1998). Deep reinforcement learning uses deep neu- 
ral networks to represent policies. These models enable interaction with environments requiring 
high-dimensional state inputs (e.g., Atari games). 
Consider the graphical model in Figure 2a representing the deep RL system for a vision-based 
game environment. The environment maintains some (usually latent) game state. Some function 
F produces a high-dimensional pixel representation of game state (���Pixels���). The learned network 
takes this pixel image and produces logits used to select an action. Temporally extended sequences 
of this action selection procedure result in observed agent behavior. 
Saliency maps are produced by performing some kind of intervention M on this system and calcu- 
lating the difference in logits produced by the original and modif i ed images. The interventions used 
to calculate saliency for deep RL are performed at the pixel level (red node and arrow in Figure 2a). 
These interventions change the conditional probability distribution of ���Pixels��� by giving it another 
parent (Pearl, 2000). 2

Functionally, this can be accomplished through a variety of means, including changing the color 
of the pixel (Simonyan et al., 2014), adding a gray mask (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014), blurring a small 
region (Greydanus et al., 2017), or masking objects with the background color (Iyer et al., 2018). 
The interventions M are used to simulate the effect of the absence of the pixel(s) on the network���s 
output. Note however that these interventions change the image in a way that is inconsistent with the 
generative process F. They are not ���naturalistic��� modif i cations. This type of intervention produces 
images for which the learned network function may not be well-def i ned.

The section "Interpreting Saliency Maps in Deep RL" from the paper you mentioned focuses on understanding the role of saliency maps in analyzing the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Key points from this section include:
Use of Saliency Maps in RL
: Saliency maps are used to identify important areas in the input data (e.g., pixels in an image) that influence the action selection of a deep RL agent. These maps highlight regions of an image that the agent deems important for making decisions.
Example with Atari Game 'Breakout'
: The paper illustrates the use of saliency maps with the example of the Atari game 'Breakout'. Saliency maps highlight certain regions, like a tunnel through the bricks, which might be interpreted as areas the agent focuses on to maximize its score. However, the paper points out that this interpretation might not be accurate.
Challenges in Interpreting Saliency Maps
: The authors note that the interpretation of saliency maps can be misleading. For instance, moving the tunnel in the 'Breakout' game does not always lead to the same saliency pattern, suggesting that the saliency map might not directly reflect the agent's understanding or strategy.
Saliency Maps as Interventions
: The paper describes how saliency maps are created by intervening in the deep RL system. These interventions are made at the pixel level, changing the input image and observing how the agent's behavior (output logits) changes.
Technical Details of RL and Saliency Maps
: The paper delves into the mechanics of reinforcement learning, where agents learn a policy that maps states to actions based on reward signals. Saliency maps are used to analyze these policies by altering the high-dimensional state inputs (like pixels in Atari games) and observing the changes in the agent���s decision-making process.
Causal Graphical Model
: A causal graphical model is presented to illustrate the relationship between the agent and the environment, highlighting the intervention points (saliency maps) and their effects on the agent���s behavior.
Limitations of Saliency Map Interventions
: The authors caution that the modifications made by saliency map interventions may not align with the natural generative process of the environment, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.
This section emphasizes the importance of careful interpretation of saliency maps in deep RL, pointing out that while they can provide insights into an agent's decision-making process, they may not always offer a straightforward or accurate explanation of the agent's behavior. The paper suggests a need for a nuanced understanding of how these maps are generated and their potential limitations in representing the agent's learning and decision-making processes.

2.2EXPLANATIONS FROMSALIENCYMAPS 
To form explanations of agent behavior, human observers combine information from saliency maps, 
agent behavior, and semantic concepts. Figure 2b shows a system diagram of how these components 
interact. Hypotheses about the semantic features identif i ed by the learned policy are proposed by 
reasoning backwards about what representation might jointly produce the observed saliency pattern 
and agent behavior. 
Counterfactual reasoning has been identif i ed as a particularly effective way to present explanations 
of the decision boundaries of deep models (Mittelstadt et al., 2019). Humans use counterfactuals 
to reason about the enabling conditions of particular outcomes, as well as to identify situations 
where the outcome would have occurred even in the absence of some action or condition (Byrne, 
2019). Saliency maps provide a kind of pixel-level counterfactual, but if the goal is to explain agent 
behavior according to semantic concepts, interventions at the pixel level may not be suff i cient. 
Since many semantic concepts may map to the same set of pixels, it may be diff i cult to identify 
the functional relationship between changes in pixels and changes in network output according to 
semanticconceptsorgamestate(Chalupkaetal.,2015). Researchersmaybeinterpretingdifferences 
in network outputs as evidence of differences in semantic concepts. However, changes in pixels do 
not guarantee changes in semantic concepts or game state. 
In terms of changes to pixels, semantic concepts, and game state, we distinguish among three classes 
of interventions: distortion, semantics-preserving, and fat-hand (see Table 1). Semantics-preserving 
and fat-hand interventions are def i ned with respect to a specif i c set of semantic concepts. Fat-hand 
interventions change game state in such a way that the semantic concepts of interest are also altered. 
The pixel-level manipulations used to produce saliency maps primarily result in distortion inter- 
ventions, though some saliency methods (e.g., object-based) may conceivably produce semantics- 
preserving or fat-hand interventions as well. As pixel-level interventions are not guaranteed to 
produce changes in semantic concepts, counterfactual evaluations applying semantics-preserving 
interventions may be a more appropriate approach for precisely testing hypotheses of behavior.

The section "2.2 Explanations from Saliency Maps" in the paper further explores how saliency maps are used to form explanations of agent behavior in deep reinforcement learning (RL) environments. Key aspects of this section include:
Combining Information for Explanations
: Human observers create explanations of an RL agent's behavior by combining information from saliency maps, observed agent behavior, and semantic concepts. They form hypotheses about the features identified by the agent's learned policy by reasoning backwards from the observed saliency pattern and agent behavior.
Use of Counterfactual Reasoning
: Counterfactual reasoning is highlighted as an effective method for explaining the decision boundaries of deep models. It involves considering what might happen under different conditions or in the absence of certain actions or conditions. While saliency maps offer a form of pixel-level counterfactual, they may not be sufficient for explaining agent behavior in terms of broader semantic concepts.
Limitations of Pixel-Level Interventions
: Saliency maps focus on pixel-level changes, but many semantic concepts can map to the same set of pixels, making it difficult to establish a clear functional relationship between pixel changes and changes in network output in terms of these concepts. Consequently, changes in pixels may not necessarily correspond to changes in semantic concepts or game state.
Types of Interventions
: The paper categorizes interventions into three types - distortion, semantics-preserving, and fat-hand:
Distortion Interventions
: Change pixels without altering the game state or semantic concepts. Examples include adversarial ML where noise is added to images to change network output without perceptible changes to humans.
Semantics-Preserving Interventions
: Manipulations that preserve certain semantic concepts. For example, reflecting an image across a line of symmetry may change the game state but not alter semantic information about the scene.
Fat-Hand Interventions
: Changes that are intended to measure the effect of a specific treatment but unintentionally alter other aspects of the system.
Appropriateness of Different Interventions for Testing Hypotheses
: The paper suggests that counterfactual evaluations using semantics-preserving interventions may be more suitable for precisely testing hypotheses about agent behavior, as pixel-level manipulations primarily result in distortion interventions and may not reflect changes in semantic concepts.
In summary, this section emphasizes the complexities of interpreting saliency maps in deep RL and the need for careful consideration of the types of interventions used to form accurate explanations of agent behavior. It highlights the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of interventions and their respective impacts on the interpretation of saliency maps.

3SURVEY OFUSAGE OFSALIENCYMAPS INDEEPRL LITERATURE 
To assess how saliency maps are used to make inferences regarding agent behavior in practice, we 
surveyed recent conference papers in deep RL. We focused our pool of papers on those that use 
saliency maps to generate explanations or make claims regarding agent behavior. Our search criteria 
consisted of examining papers that cited work that i rst described any of the following four types of 
saliency maps: 
Jacobian Saliency. Wang et al. (2015) extended gradient-based saliency maps to deep RL by 
computing the Jacobian of the output logits with respect to a stack of input images. 
Perturbation Saliency. Greydanus et al. (2017) generate saliency maps by perturbing the origi- 
nal input image using a Gaussian blur of the image and measure changes in policy from remov- 
ing information from a region. 
Object Saliency. Iyer et al. (2018) use template matching, a common computer vision tech- 
nique (Brunelli, 2009), to detect (template) objects within an input image and measure salience 
through changes in Q-values for masked and unmasked objects. 
Attention Saliency. Most recently, attention-based saliency mapping methods have been pro- 
posed to generate interpretable saliency maps (Mott et al., 2019; Nikulin et al., 2019). 
From a set of 90 papers, we found 46 claims drawn from 11 papers that cited and used saliency maps 
as evidence in their explanations of agent behavior. The full set of claims are given in Appendix A.

Table 2: Summary of the survey on usage of saliency maps. 
The columns contains different types of saliency methods 
and the rows contain different traits regarding the claims. 
We found three categories of saliency 
map usage, summarized in Table 2. 
First, all claims interpret salient areas 
as a proxy for agent focus. For exam- 
ple, a claim about a Breakout agent 
notes that the network is focusing on 
the paddle and little else (Greydanus 
et al., 2017). 
Second, 87% of the claims in our 
survey propose hypotheses about the 
features of the learned policy by rea- 
soning backwards about what repre- 
sentation might jointly produce the 
observed saliency pattern and agent behavior. These types of claims either develop an a priori 
explanation of behavior and verify it using saliency, or they propose an ad hoc explanation after ob- 
serving saliency to reason about how the agent is using salient areas. One a priori claim notes that

the displayed score is the only differing factor between two states and verify from saliency that the 
agent is focusing on these pixels (Zahavy et al., 2016). An ad hoc claim about a racing game notes 
that the agent is recognizing a time-of-day cue from the background color and acting to prepare for 
a new race (Yang et al., 2018). 
Finally, only 7% (3 out of 46) of the claims attempt to empirically verify the explanations generated 
from saliency maps. One of these attempts to corroborate the interpreted saliency behavior by 
obtaining additional saliency samples from multiple runs of the game. The other two attempt to 
manipulate semantics in the pixel input to assess the agent���s response by, for example, adding an 
additional object to verify a hypothesis about memorization (Annasamy & Sycara, 2019).

The section "3 Survey of Usage of Saliency Maps in Deep RL Literature" from the paper provides an analysis of how saliency maps are utilized in the deep reinforcement learning (RL) field. The authors conducted a survey of recent conference papers to understand the inferences and claims made using saliency maps. Key points from this section include:
Survey Methodology
: The authors surveyed papers that cited key works on four types of saliency maps: Jacobian Saliency, Perturbation Saliency, Object Saliency, and Attention Saliency. They identified and analyzed 46 claims from 11 papers that used saliency maps to explain agent behavior.
Types of Saliency Maps
:
Jacobian Saliency
: Uses gradients to determine the importance of pixels.
Perturbation Saliency
: Involves blurring parts of the image and observing changes in the agent's policy.
Object Saliency
: Detects objects in the image and measures changes in Q-values for masked versus unmasked objects.
Attention Saliency
: Employs attention-based methods to generate interpretable maps.
Survey Results
: The survey categorized the claims based on their focus and approach to saliency map interpretation:
Interpretation as Agent Focus
: All claims interpreted salient areas as indicative of where the agent focuses its attention.
Hypotheses on Learned Policy Features
: Most claims (87%) proposed hypotheses about the learned policy by reasoning backward from the observed saliency patterns and agent behavior. These include both a priori explanations (formulated before observing saliency) and ad hoc explanations (formulated after observing saliency).
Empirical Verification of Explanations
: Only 7% of the claims attempted to empirically verify the explanations derived from saliency maps. This involved obtaining additional saliency samples or manipulating the pixel input to assess the agent's response.
Examples of Claims
: Examples provided in the survey include claims about agents focusing on certain pixels in a game, recognizing cues from the environment, and responding to changes in game state.
Conclusion
: The survey highlights that while saliency maps are widely used to interpret and explain deep RL agent behavior, there is a lack of empirical verification of the explanations provided. Most claims rely on backward reasoning from saliency patterns to agent behavior, with few attempts to empirically validate these interpretations.
This section underscores the importance of critically evaluating the use of saliency maps in deep RL and the need for more rigorous methods to validate the hypotheses and explanations derived from these visualizations.

tance and enemy saliency is correlated using observational data. We collect 1000 frames of an 
episode of Amidar and record the Manhattan distance to the player and object salience of each en- 
emy. Figure 5a shows the distance of each enemy to the player over time with saliency intensity 
represented by the shaded region. Figure 5b shows the correlation between the distance to each 
enemy and the corresponding saliency. It is clear that there is no correlation between saliency and 
distance of each enemy to the player. 
Giventhatstatisticaldependenceisalmostalwaysanecessarypre-conditionforcausation, weexpect 
that there will not be any causal dependence. To further examine this, we intervene on enemy 
positions of salient enemies at each timestep by moving the enemy closer and farther away from the 
player. Figure 5c contains these results. Given Hypothesis 3, we would expect see an increasing 
trend in saliency for enemies closer to the player. However, this is not the case. 
In addition, we i nd no correlation in the enemy distance experiments for the Jacobian or pertur- 
bation saliency methods (included in Appendix B.2). Jacobian saliency performed the worst for 
the intervention-based experiment, suggesting that there is no impact of player-enemy distance on 
saliency. 
Conclusion. Spurious correlations, or misinterpretations of existing correlation, can occur between 
two processes (e.g. correlation between player-enemy distance and saliency), and human observers 
are susceptible to identifying spurious correlations (Simon, 1954). Spurious correlations can some- 
times be identif i ed from observational analysis without requiring interventional analysis. 
6DISCUSSION ANDRELATEDWORK 
Thinking counterfactually about the explanations generated from saliency maps facilitates empirical 
evaluation of those explanations. The experiments above show some of the diff i culties in drawing 
conclusions from saliency maps. These include the tendency of human observers to incorrectly infer 
association between observed processes, the potential for experimental evidence to contradict seem- 
ingly obvious observational conclusions, and the challenges of potential confounding in temporal 
processes. 
One of the main conclusions from this evaluation is that saliency maps are an exploratory tool 
rather than an explanatory tool. Saliency maps alone cannot be reliably used to infer explanations 
and instead require other supporting tools. This can include combining evidence from saliency

maps with other explanation methods or employing a more experimental approach to evaluation of 
saliency maps such as the approach demonstrated in the case studies above. 
The framework for generating falsif i able hypotheses suggested in Section 4 can assist with designing 
more specif i c and falsif i able explanations. The distinction between the components of an explana- 
tion, particularly the semantic concept set X, learned representation R and observed behavior B, 
can further assist in experimental evaluation. 
Generalization of Proposed Methodology.We propose intervention-based experimentation as a 
primary tool to evaluate the hypotheses generated from saliency maps. Yet, alternative methods can 
identify a false hypothesis even earlier. For instance, evaluating statistical dependence alone can 
help identify some situations in which causation is absent (e.g., Case Study 3). 
We employ TOYBOX, a high-performance suite of intervenable RL environments, designed for be- 
havioral tests Tosch et al. (2019). However, limited forms of evaluation may be possible in non- 
intervenable environments, though they may be more tedious to implement. For instance, each of 
the interventions conducted in Case Study 1 can be produced in an observation-only environment by 
manipulating the pixel input (Brunelli, 2009; Chalupka et al., 2015). Developing more experimental 
systems for evaluating explanations is an open area of research. 
Evaluation and Critiques of Saliency Maps. Prior work in the deep network literature has evalu- 
ated and critiqued saliency maps. Kindermans et al. (2019) and Adebayo et al. (2018) demonstrate 
the utility of saliency maps by adding random variance in input. Seo et al. (2018) provide a theoret- 
ical justif i cation of saliency and hypothesize that there exists a correlation between gradients-based 
saliency methods and model interpretation. Samek et al. (2017) and Hooker et al. (2018) present 
evaluation of existing saliency methods for image classif i cation. Others have critiqued network 
attention as a means of explanation (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Brunner et al., 2019).

In this section of the paper, the authors discuss their survey and evaluation of the use of saliency maps in deep reinforcement learning (RL), highlighting the challenges and limitations in interpreting these maps. The key points include:
Case Study on Enemy Saliency in Amidar
: The authors conducted a study on the game Amidar, analyzing the correlation between enemy distance to the player and the saliency of enemies. They found no correlation, suggesting that saliency does not reflect the distance of enemies from the player.
Interventional Analysis
: To further test the relationship, they intervened by changing the positions of enemies. The hypothesis was that saliency would increase as enemies moved closer to the player, but this was not observed.
Lack of Correlation with Other Saliency Methods
: The paper also mentions (in Appendix B.2) that no correlation was found in enemy distance experiments using Jacobian or perturbation saliency methods. This further suggests that player-enemy distance does not impact saliency.
Conclusion on Spurious Correlations
: The authors conclude that spurious correlations can occur, and human observers might misinterpret these correlations in the context of saliency maps. Observational analysis can sometimes identify these spurious correlations without requiring interventional analysis.
Discussion on Saliency Map Interpretation
: The paper discusses the difficulties in drawing conclusions from saliency maps, such as the tendency for incorrect inference of association and the challenge of confounding in temporal processes.
Saliency Maps as Exploratory Tools
: The authors conclude that saliency maps are better used as exploratory tools rather than explanatory tools. They cannot reliably be used to infer explanations on their own and should be combined with other methods or a more experimental approach.
Proposed Methodology for Evaluation
: The paper proposes intervention-based experimentation as a primary tool for evaluating hypotheses generated from saliency maps. They also suggest that evaluating statistical dependence alone can help identify situations where causation is absent.
Generalization of Methodology and Evaluation of Saliency Maps
: The paper suggests the development of experimental systems for evaluating explanations as an open area of research and reviews prior work that has evaluated and critiqued saliency maps in deep network literature.
Final Conclusions
: The authors recommend using saliency maps as an exploratory tool and not as an explanatory tool, as they cannot be trusted to reflect causal relationships between semantic concepts and agent behavior.
This section emphasizes the importance of a cautious and rigorous approach in interpreting saliency maps and the need for more robust methods to validate interpretations and inferences made from these visualizations in deep RL.

Could you simplify it a bit more?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! The main points of this section of the paper are:
Study on a Video Game
: The authors looked at how saliency maps work in a game called "Amidar". They checked if the "importance" shown by the saliency maps (bright areas) matched the distance of enemies from the player character. They found no match.
Testing by Moving Enemies
: They also tried changing the positions of the enemies to see if that affected the saliency maps. The expectation was that if enemies were closer to the player, they would become more "important" in the saliency map. But this didn't happen.
Other Methods Didn't Show Correlation Either
: They mention that other ways of creating saliency maps also didn't show any link between enemy distance and saliency.
Conclusion on Misleading Results
: The authors conclude that it's easy to misinterpret the results of saliency maps. Sometimes, what seems like a connection isn't really there.
Saliency Maps as Exploratory Tools
: The paper suggests that saliency maps should be used for exploration rather than as definitive explanations. They can't always reliably tell us why an AI agent is behaving a certain way.
Recommendations for Evaluating Saliency Maps
: They recommend using more thorough methods, like experiments, to really understand what saliency maps are showing.
Final Thoughts
: In conclusion, the authors say that saliency maps are good for exploring ideas but shouldn't be used alone to explain the behavior of AI agents in games.
In short, the paper cautions against relying too heavily on saliency maps for understanding AI behavior, as these maps can sometimes be misleading.

Connections to the earlier topics.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The connections between the paper's section on "Survey of Usage of Saliency Maps in Deep RL" and the earlier topics discussed in the paper are as follows:
Counterfactual Reasoning and Saliency Maps
:
Earlier in the paper, counterfactual reasoning is highlighted as an effective method for understanding the decision-making process in complex systems, like causal inference models and deep RL agents.
In the survey of saliency maps, counterfactual reasoning is again crucial. The authors test hypotheses about agent behavior by manipulating conditions (like enemy positions) and observing changes, which is a form of counterfactual analysis.
Interpreting Complex Systems (Deep RL Agents and Causal Inference Models)
:
Both the earlier topics and the survey section deal with the challenge of interpreting complex systems. In causal inference models, the complexity arises from latent confounders and hierarchical data structures. In deep RL, complexity comes from understanding how agents learn and make decisions based on high-dimensional inputs.
Saliency maps in deep RL are used to interpret agent behavior, similar to how Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC) are used to understand causal relationships in complex data.
Misinterpretation and the Need for Rigorous Analysis
:
The earlier sections discuss the potential for misinterpretation when dealing with latent confounders and the need for a robust model like GP-SLC.
The saliency maps section also emphasizes the risk of misinterpretation, showing that what seems obvious in a saliency map may not actually reflect the true behavior or focus of an RL agent.
Saliency Maps as Exploratory Tools
:
The conclusion that saliency maps should be viewed as exploratory rather than explanatory mirrors the cautious approach advocated in earlier sections regarding causal inference. Both emphasize the importance of not jumping to conclusions without thorough analysis and verification.
Empirical Verification and Experimentation
:
In earlier topics, the importance of empirical verification in causal inference is stressed. Similarly, in the saliency maps section, the authors highlight the need for empirical testing to validate the hypotheses generated from saliency maps.
In summary, the connections lie in the shared themes of interpreting complex systems, the need for careful analysis to avoid misinterpretation, and the emphasis on empirical verification and experimentation as crucial components in both causal inference and deep reinforcement learning research.

ICLR 2020 Conference Program Chairs

Decision: Accept (Poster)
Comment: This was a contentious paper, with quite a large variance in the ratings, and ultimately a lack of consensus. After reading the paper myself, I found it to be a valuable synthesis of common usage of saliency maps and a critique of their improper interpretation. Further, the demonstration of more rigorous methods of evaluating agents based on salience maps using case studies is quite illustrative and compelling. I think we as a field can agree that we���d like to gain better understanding our deep RL models. This is not possible if we don���t have a good understanding of the analysis tools we���re using.

R2 rightly pointed out a need for quantitative justification for their results, in the form of statistical tests, which the authors were able to provide, leading the reviewer to revise their score to the highest value of 8. I thank them for instigating the discussion.

R1 continues to feel that the lack of a methodological contribution (in the form of improving learning within an agent) is a weakness. However, I don���t believe that all papers at deep learning conferences have to have the goal of empirically ���learning better��� on some benchmark task or dataset, and that there���s room at ICLR for more analysis papers. Indeed, it���d be nice to see more papers like this.
 
For this reason, I���m inclined to recommend accept for this paper. However this paper does have weaknesses, in that the framework proposed could be made more rigorous and formal. Currently it seems rather adhoc and on a task-by-task basis (ie we need to have access to game states or define them ourselves for the task). It���s also disappointing that it doesn���t work for recurrent agents, which limits its applicability for analyzing current SOTA deep RL agents. I wonder if authors can comment on possible extensions that would allow for this.

And so a saliency map is like a heat map showing what? How is salience defined?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
A saliency map, in the context of deep learning and particularly in deep reinforcement learning (RL), is akin to a heat map that visually represents which parts of the input (like an image or a frame in a video game) the model is focusing on or considering important when making decisions. Here's how it works and what it shows:
Visual Representation
: A saliency map is overlaid on the input image. The areas where the map is brighter or more intense indicate higher importance or attention by the model.
How Salience is Defined
: In deep learning, salience is typically defined in terms of how much each part of the input (like each pixel in an image) contributes to the model's final decision or output. For example, in a game, the model might focus on certain objects or areas that are crucial for its next move.
Creation of Saliency Maps
: These maps are created using various techniques that analyze the model's decision-making process. Common methods include:
Gradient-Based
: Looking at how changes in input pixels affect the changes in the model���s output. If a small change in a pixel significantly changes the output, that pixel is considered highly salient.
Perturbation-Based
: Observing how the model's output changes when parts of the input are altered (like blurring or masking parts of an image).
Purpose
: Saliency maps are used to gain insights into what the model is "paying attention to". They are especially useful in complex models like deep neural networks, where the decision-making process is not inherently interpretable.
Applications
: In deep RL, saliency maps can help understand the strategy or focus of an agent in a game environment ��� for instance, whether it���s focusing on enemies, obstacles, or other elements of the game.
In summary, saliency maps are tools for visualizing which parts of the input data are most influential in a model's decision-making process, providing a heat map-like representation of the model's focus or attention. However, as discussed in the papers, interpreting these maps requires care, as they may not always straightforwardly or accurately reflect the model's reasoning process.

Can you do one in matplotlib?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Creating a saliency map using Matplotlib requires a deep learning model to analyze and generate the saliency data. Since I can't run deep learning models directly, I'll guide you through a simplified process of how you would create a basic heatmap, which resembles a saliency map, using Matplotlib. This example won't be a true saliency map, but it will demonstrate the concept of visualizing data intensity, similar to what a saliency map does.
Let's create a random heatmap for demonstration:
We'll generate a grid of random values (simulating saliency scores).
We'll use Matplotlib to visualize these values as a heatmap.
Here's how you can do it in Python:
python
Copy code

# Generating random data
data = np.random.rand(

)
# 10x10 grid of random values
# Creating the heatmap
plt.imshow(data, cmap=
'hot'
, interpolation=
'nearest'
)
plt.colorbar()
# Adds a color bar to match values to colors
plt.title(
"Random Heatmap"
)
plt.show()
This code will display a 10x10 grid heatmap where each cell's color intensity corresponds to the value in
data
, mimicking how a saliency map highlights areas of importance. Remember, in actual saliency maps, these values would be derived from a model's interpretation of input data, like an image.

interventions they receive individually. This pa-

confounders that have this structure and thereby 
improve estimates of causal effects. The key inno- 
vations are a hierarchical Bayesian model, Gaus- 
sian processes with structured latent confounders 
(GP-SLC), and a Monte Carlo inference algorithm 
for this model based on elliptical slice sampling.

This passage describes an approach to addressing a common challenge in causal inference: the presence of latent confounders. These are unobserved variables that influence both the treatment and the outcome in a study, potentially biasing the estimates of causal effects. Let's break down the key points:
Latent Confounders
: These are variables that are not directly observed or measured but can influence both the treatment (like an educational intervention) and the outcome (such as student performance).
Influence Across Observations
: An example given is how the difficulty of a course can be a latent confounder affecting all students taking the course. This factor can influence the outcome alongside any individual educational interventions the students receive.
Semiparametric Modeling of Latent Confounders
: The paper introduces a method to model these latent confounders semiparametrically. This means the model partially relies on parametric assumptions (fixed, predefined models) and partially on non-parametric approaches (more flexible, data-driven models).
Hierarchical Bayesian Model
: The approach uses a hierarchical Bayesian model. In such models, parameters are treated as random variables, and prior distributions are assigned to them. Hierarchical models are particularly useful in dealing with data that has natural groupings (like students within a course).
Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC)
: This is the key innovation. Gaussian processes are used for modeling the latent confounders, providing a flexible, non-linear approach to understanding how these unobserved variables might affect the treatment and outcome.
Monte Carlo Inference Algorithm based on Elliptical Slice Sampling
: For inference in this model, an algorithm based on elliptical slice sampling is used. This is a Monte Carlo method, a class of algorithms used for simulating the distributions of complex models. Elliptical slice sampling is particularly suited for models with Gaussian process priors.
In summary, the paper proposes a novel method to improve causal effect estimates in situations where latent confounders are present and shared across observations. This is achieved through a combination of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, Gaussian processes, and advanced Monte Carlo inference techniques.

Yes, there are several connections between this discussion on modeling latent confounders using Gaussian Processes with Structured Latent Confounders (GP-SLC) and our earlier discussions:
Causal Inference and Latent Confounders
:
Our initial discussion about the GP-SLC paper focused on the challenge of latent confounders in causal inference. This recent explanation further details the nature of these confounders and the innovative approach of GP-SLC in addressing them.
Use of Bayesian Models and Gaussian Processes
:
Both in our initial exploration of the GP-SLC paper and this discussion, the role of hierarchical Bayesian models and Gaussian processes is central. These tools provide a sophisticated way to handle complex, unobserved variables in data.
Interpretation Challenges in Complex Systems
:
Our discussion on the use of saliency maps in deep RL touched on the difficulties of interpreting complex systems and the risk of misinterpretation. Similarly, in causal inference, latent confounders represent a complexity that can lead to biased estimates if not properly modeled, highlighting the importance of sophisticated methods like GP-SLC for accurate interpretation.
Methodological Rigor and Empirical Verification
:
In the context of saliency maps, we discussed the importance of empirical verification and avoiding misinterpretations. The GP-SLC model's approach to latent confounders reflects a similar need for methodological rigor and accurate modeling to ensure reliable conclusions in causal inference studies.
Exploratory vs. Explanatory Tools
:
Just as we concluded that saliency maps should be considered exploratory tools rather than explanatory ones, the GP-SLC model, with its advanced handling of latent confounders, exemplifies an exploratory approach to uncovering hidden relationships in data, which is crucial for accurate causal inference.
In essence, both discussions highlight the complexity inherent in modeling and interpreting data, whether in causal inference or deep reinforcement learning, and underscore the need for advanced methodologies to address these challenges accurately.
