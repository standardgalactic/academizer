GPT-4
Summarize: In a thread elsewhere, Michael Tontchev from Meta was the first to provide great feedback to my Substack post (see comments for link) titled "AI Alignment is Trivial". His long post deserved a detailed reply, which I paste below.

Michael Tontchev> The first mistake is believing that, for a *generalizing* intelligence, you can control what it learns based on what you show it (within certain bounds). A property of general intelligence is that it fills in the holes of information that you show it. Humans didn't come onto Earth with all the knowledge we have. We also weren't taught to be evil. AIs won't need to be taught to be evil to do things that *we* consider evil. People do evil acts out of convenience and expedience all the time. It's enough for the AI to not deeply care about humans for it to take actions that we find to be evil in order to achieve given endpoints.

Monica< "Filling in" is likely not the right metaphor. Try "Abstraction". It comes in a few flavors, and one of them is "Generalization" which can be implemented by gathering a number of examples, such as using word2vec, and then discarding more and more properties of each candidate concept until we have one simplified, more general concept separate from all others, that covers a majority of similar enumerated cases that it's a "cheap abstraction" of.. This is the first level we can expect to see in LLMs and it may currently be the main way these discover abstractions. That is certainly true for my own LLMs. But this is not about behavior, which are learned separately later.

Monica> People become racists by learning racist behaviors from family and peers early in life. Later in life they may read about racism in a larger context. This is likely to make them less racist, not more. And learning about racism in context is no different than learning about cannibalism, but we see very few cannibals in modern society because we cannot observe such behavior in others. The key point is that the primary corpus is where we get the language skills, and which may well describe racism and cannibalism, are learned in unsupervised mode and what we get beyond language skills is a spotty sampling of facts discussed in the corpus. But not any behaviors.

Michael Tontchev> RLHF depends on us successfully identifying bad AI behavior to be able to train it out.

Monica> No. The base model has no behaviors. We are ADDING all behaviors we want and if we are doing it poorly, we get bad behaviors. I'm serious when I say that "Creating an evil AI requires extra effort". The default is always "no behaviors".

Monica> Let's look at the different levels of LLM API calls. At the bottom in a typical LLM stack is embed() which returns embeddings suitable for document classification by similarity. This is the level my own cloud-based LLM operates ATM. No behavior is required, just DOCSIM. Next higher is complete() which asks the LLM to complete the prompt. It is important to note that this is very minimal behavior. If you give it a question, it will elaborate (!) on the question rather than answering it, which is pretty useless. An LLM will only answer questions after we instill question-answering behavior using supervised learning. I think there are open source batches for doing this to new LLMs. Next step up is dialog() where we allow the system to read parts of an ongoing dialog and continue the dialog in a useful way. This is the trickiest part and is done using RLHF. And this is where some LLM vendors attempt to do semi-stupid things like outlaw dangerous or offensive replies. Something we
are not particularly good at, so far, but we're learning, as a species. But it should be very clear that all behavior learning is done separately from the facts, and facts don't affect behaviors.

Michael Tontchev> Complex AI behaviors can be very difficult to find. Many GPT3 and 4 behaviors were only discovered after they were released - some well after they were released. Sydney's misbehavior wasn't caught before it was released. Dalle-3's integration with Bing also has behavior that wasn't caught at test time to be ironed out. You can't fix a problem you don't know is there until much later. Humans "behaved well" for 290,000 years, until suddenly a switch flipped and we became the species that controlled the planet's future. Plus, RLHF isn't a fix-all: in training AIs to say what we want them to say, AIs learn to... say what we want them to say. Understanding how this interplays with *deception* is non-trivial. After all, lying to people is the same thing as teaching them to say what you want them to say. As to using AIs to inspect the output of other AIs: sure,

Michael Tontchev> but the inspector AI has to be as smart as the first AI in order to be able to catch all bad things in that behavior. At that point, how do you align *that first* AI?

Monica> This is not a level playing field. Detecting persuasion is much much easier than attempting to mask it from a detector.

Monica> LLM learning language and spotty facts from a large text corpus has, at most, the goal function to "learn more". The "deception" examples are the results of user prompts forcing the system into corner case behaviors. I insist on discussing "evil humans subverting neutral AIs" separately from the "Evil AI" issues -- let's start with the latter and then get back to the former.. It is very hard for us as advanced monkeys to imagine systems without evolution-induced tacit competitive goal functions.

Monica> The "first AI" is an LLM and has no behaviors. We can trivially *program* them to just do classification of sentences and making an LLM based filter for bad behaviors like persuasion (ads, political speech, etc) is straightforward.  My own in-cloud systems could likely already do a decent job of this.

Michael Tontchev> AIs will always have blank spots caused by corpus omissions and misunderstandings caused by conflicting information in the corpora This implies to me that you're not really seeing AGI as AGI, but as LLMs++.

Monica> Setting aside the fact that the term "AGI" is so poorly defined it is vacuous, I like to claim that my idea of not teaching them evil behaviors is sufficient to allow us a safe path towards AGI, where experiments at LLM providers can ensure reasonably safe LLMS, which are already very valuable. AGI in many people's minds seems to mean "human-like" and that's not something we should aim for. At. All.

Michael Tontchev> In creating human-level machine intelligence, we will create machines that are reliant on very little information in the corpus. They will learn and build world models from the information they discover, by themselves, from scratch.

Monica> Er. Where would this information come from if not from the corpus? Especially if the LLMs are, like today, (nearly or totally?) incapable of Reasoning?

Michael Tontchev> If they don't learn about explosives from their training corpus, they would not only find out about them when they sent out into the world to learn more, but they would also be able to *recreate them from scratch*, just like humans didn't come into existence knowing about them. Because that's what generalizing intelligence does. It discovers new things that no brain knew about before (and plenty that existing brains have discovered!). Not to mention superintelligence, which would bring AI to even beyond-human levels. There's no reason but hubris to believe that humans are the peak of intelligence (nor anywhere close to it).

Monica> Superintelligence based on recursive self-improvement is a 20th Century AI myth which I discuss in Chapter B1 on my main site.
Michael Tontchev> Your suggestion of not providing the AI with dangerous information fails for the same reason that you actually mention in your "Pollyanna Problem": knowing about dangerous things is the basis for avoiding them and dealing with them. And, of course, again, the property of generalizing intelligence is that you don't get to pick what it learns. Once you have the right algorithm in place, *it will find that information*, because someone will just set it loose in the internet/world.

Monica> Lots of dangerous information is already available on Google and Encyclopedia Britannica, and on arXiv and other research publishing sites. LLMs change very little about this fact.

Michael Tontchev> Essentially all the proposals ignore generalizing properties of AIs that the world will be building, as well as the incentives and systems issues that arise when this is done competitively. Unless safety is taken seriously at a global catastrophic level, no company will want to limit their AIs, because from their perspective they could always beat out the competition. The push is to make AIs more capable, more general, faster, cheaper, etc. Over time, hardware improvements will make all of these much easier to achieve as well, so any given level of AI will, over time, "for free" result in even better AIs.

Monica> This is part of the Metacrisis. See Meditations on Moloch. I believe personal AIs ("Confidantes" in my parlance, as seen in the movie "Her" and presaged in AI and SF for decades) can Moderate Moloch. I'm writing a SubStack post on that too.

Monica, original post> Modern AIs are based on Deep Neural Networks, which are Holistic by design. One aspect of this is that they don't need a goal function.

Michael Tontchev> I don't know how you can say this [No goal functions]. Objective functions are a core component of neural networks. It's literally how they work - they're optimizers against an objective function.

Monica> What is that goal function? It's expressed as tweaking weights on links to minimize prediction errors in text. There is no goal function above the level of "predict better". Certainly nothing about behaviors in the language learning phase.

Michael Tontchev> Especially when you throw in reinforcement learning techniques, it's objective functions, and the choice determines what weird edge case behavior you might get.

Monica> Now we are getting somewhere. We are agreeing that behaviors come from reinforcement learning of behaviors, not from the main unsupervised language learning corpus. Which may include information about racism and cannibalism.

Monica, original post> A system without a goal function gets its purpose from the user input, from the prompt. When the answer has been generated, the system returns to the ground state.

Michael Tontchev> Again, you're thinking of superintelligent AI as LLMs++. That's not the types of AIs we will be building. They will operate continuously and respond to continuous input. Even if they perform one passthrough and pause, we will be running them in loops, where past behavior and deductions influence future behaviors.

Monica> You are discussing hypothetical future systems, influenced by 20th Century thinking. LLMs may be more important than you think for where we will be going. And yes, IMO LLM++ is the correct way to think about future AI.

Monica, original post> Future AIs may be given long-term objectives. Research into how to do this safely will be required.

Monica> Language learning takes cloudmonths for the competition and a week on a laptop for my LLMs. We don't want to do that too often. But running a batch of supervised and/or reinforcement learning can be done cheaply once you have the base language competence available. Learn language once, and then run a thousand behavior-dictating experiments as incremental learning on a copy of the base. Learn from these experiments. Move safely to the next step towards AGI.

Michael Tontchev> Yes, that's a huge part of this effort! Any generally intelligent system that is given a non-trivial goal takes on instrumental subgoals that help it accomplish that goal.

Monica> This is 20th Century AI thinking. It's not Holistic enough. We have no reason to assume subgoals in Understanding scenarios and we are not yet doing Reasoning. Read my Red Pill.

Michael Tontchev> A robot can't bring you a cup of coffee if it falls and breaks. It similarly can't bring you the coffee if someone shuts it off. So a logical deduction from "bring this guy coffee" is "avoid shutoff". Similarly, "avoid having preferences changed". Other things like power acquisition and deception also come into play for larger goals. The point of almost all AI labs is to create mesa-optimizers, just like humans. While they are trained on one objective function, the goal of their training is a system that can then go on to optimize for any kind of problem. You're thinking of narrow AIs. People at major AI labs are talking about AIs as untouchable by humans in reasoning as modern chess engines are or even more.

Monica> Chess is a pattern matching game at the master level. Only beginners need to Reason about moves ����

Monica> The Moravec/Woz test of making coffee makes AI a subdiscipline of Robotics. We already have Artificial General Learners in the language domain. The only truly general agents are those that can learn new tasks when they encounter them. AGI is a 20th Century idea. We need AGL. And Holistic systems are all best-effort. They are not required to do anything, because failure is always an option. If it doesn't know, it doesn't know.

Michael Tontchev> Overall, it seems like you think the training regimes of the future that build superhuman AIs will be well-controlled processes that produce expected model behavior.

Monica> This will certainly be true as long as all learning is done "at the factory" and they cannot learn from later interactions. Which is a great place to start, and that's what we have. And superhuman AI is not something we need to aim at when there's plenty of money to be made just by handling human level performance in a small number of tasks. An AI approving building permits does not need to know how to cook or play chess. That woud be a waste of computing power. In the future, not all AIs will be in the cloud. Read the last "scary" line of this post. Narrow AIs based on Language Understanding for the user communication part is what we'll see the next decade. And especially Confidantes, with voice-in, voice-out narrow AIs are going to be the most common kind. This is already happening in the 1000s of companies using LLMs for language I/O and possibly document filtering. Lots of profits to be had here, and people no longer need to know English or how to type to get stuff
done. See my SubStack.

Michael Tontchev> Instead, they will be searches in a giant mind-space for architectures and algorithms we have no idea about and that companies often might not have time to pause to study for half a year for safety, because some other company will be going full steam ahead, optimizing only for capability and not safety.

Monica> This is not what we hear from LLM providers. This may well be what happens in applications made by other parties because they have the power to set goal functions in the factory prompt. But again, these behaviors are not part of the LLM itself.

ChatGPT
Summary:
In the discussion between Monica and Michael Tontchev, the central topic revolves around the nature, design, capabilities, and potential risks associated with AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and the hypothetical evolution towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).
Key Points of the Discussion:
Generalizing Intelligence
: Michael argues that generalizing intelligence, by nature, fills in gaps in the information provided. This means an AI doesn't need to be taught evil behaviors to potentially act in ways humans consider harmful.
Abstraction and Behavior
: Monica suggests that AI's "filling in" is more about abstraction than behavior. While AI might learn about concepts like racism or cannibalism, behaviors are learned differently.
RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
: Michael points out the dependence on identifying bad AI behavior to train it out, while Monica posits that AI doesn't inherently have behaviors. Bad behaviors emerge if they're poorly trained into the model.
Neural Networks & Goal Functions
: The debate moves to whether neural networks, especially those used in modern AI, possess goal functions. Monica stresses that these networks mainly aim to "predict better" with no higher goal functions.
Continuous Learning & Superintelligence
: Michael suggests that the AIs of the future will not just be LLMs++ but will operate continuously, learning and adapting. Monica counters by saying that current systems, like LLMs, are more indicative of the path AI is taking.
Future of AI
: While Monica sees a controlled and managed evolution of AI, where language learning and behavior are distinct, Michael warns of the inherent risks of creating AI with generalizing properties, especially if developed in a competitive environment.
AGI vs. AGL
: The discussion also touches upon the idea of AGI (a 20th-century concept, according to Monica) versus AGL (Artificial General Learners). Monica emphasizes the importance of holistic systems that can adapt and learn, suggesting that future advancements should focus on AGL.
Overall, the conversation reflects the broader debate in the AI community about the capabilities, design philosophies, potential risks, and future direction of artificial intelligence. Both parties emphasize safety, but their approaches and assumptions about AI's nature and progression differ.

Altman Upsetting Investors?
Term Vectors Are Overrated

MONICA ANDERSON
13 JUN 2023

Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI that made ChatGPT) has recently been saying that he is about to make a major announcement that will upset many investors.

Some people speculate this will be about OpenAI Open-Sourcing something. Some think he will ask for more regulation. Some think he will announce a long delay before GPT5. In fact, OpenAI hasn���t even started training it yet.

My really wild speculation: "We don't actually need GPUs"

The GPT5 delay could have been brought about by research at OpenAI leading to discovery of much much cheaper GPU-free LLM algorithms, and that those algorithms may not yet be quite ready for prime time.

The ���disappointing investors��� warning would be because cloud services involving GPUs would not be needed for language Understanding henceforth; they would still be critical for images, video, speech, sound, scientific applications, etc. This would upset many budgets and companies selling GPUs.

These GPU-free Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms exist. I have been researching LLMs in my company Syntience Inc since 2001. Our product is a smaller, faster, cheaper kind of LLM that we now call an SSM ��� a Small Syntax Model. We can create a ���useful��� SSM on a laptop in under five minutes using a mere 5MB of corpus, and without using a GPU. We have a UM1 demo server in the cloud that loads a small SSM learned for just a few hours. Code to test this demo server is posted on GitHub.

Almost a year ago I posted a summary of how my SSMs are created and how they are used on my main publishing site. Chapter 8 discusses the ���OL��� learning algorithm and Chapter 9 the cloud based ���UM1��� runtime service. Note that the language in this one year old chapter does not use the term ���SSM��� since I only started using it recently.

The article you've provided touches on a variety of interesting topics related to the AI industry and potential future developments at OpenAI:
Sam Altman and OpenAI Announcement Speculation
: There's speculation surrounding a potential major announcement from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. Possible announcements include open-sourcing certain technologies, advocating for more regulation, or even delays in training the next iteration of their AI models.
GPU-Free LLM Algorithms
: The article hints at the idea that the delay in training GPT-5 could be due to research into new algorithms that do not require GPUs. GPUs are hardware accelerators commonly used in deep learning training due to their parallel processing capabilities, which speeds up the training process. If OpenAI has indeed found a way to train large language models without using GPUs, this could significantly change the economic and environmental costs associated with training large models.
Monica Anderson's SSM
: Monica Anderson mentions her company's research on a new type of language model, which she calls a "Small Syntax Model" (SSM). She claims that these SSMs can be trained quickly on minimal data without the need for GPUs. This is an intriguing claim, and if validated, could present a significant shift in how we approach training language models.
Potential Impact on GPU Market
: If major players in AI, like OpenAI, were to shift away from GPU-dependent algorithms, this could indeed have a considerable effect on the GPU market, especially companies that have invested heavily in GPU production for AI applications.
Organic Learning
: The provided link points towards a site discussing "organic learning," which likely delves deeper into the methodologies behind the SSM and how it differs from traditional deep learning approaches.
Given this information, there are a few takeaways:
Future of AI
: The landscape of AI is ever-changing, with constant innovation in algorithms, methodologies, and hardware. The potential move away from GPU-based training, if it occurs, would be an example of the rapid evolution of the field.
Small Syntax Model (SSM)
: The concept of SSM presents a different perspective on AI training. It would be interesting to delve deeper into the mechanics of SSM and how it achieves the results claimed.
Impact on Industry
: Changes in methodologies can have cascading effects on related industries, such as hardware manufacturing.
In conclusion, the AI industry remains vibrant and dynamic. The mentioned speculations, even if only partially true, hint at the exciting possibilities and shifts on the horizon.
How did we get here?
I have a ���just-so��� story that I made up from whole cloth because I wasn���t in the room when it happened. Consider this fictitious scenario:

Sometime between 2006-2014 people like Geoff Hinton get Deep learning (DL) working well for Understanding images.

By that time, and probably independently, some NLP researcher(s) invent termvectors and word2vec. These ideas provide the functionality for the famous equation of KING - MAN + WOMAN = QUEEN by allowing for Linear Algebra to work in a high-dimensional semantic concept space.

It is now a natural step for DL researchers to attempt to Understand human language by converting the input text to a strange kind of ���image��� using term vector lookup for the translation from, well, terms to vectors. And then to use the Image Understanding algorithms they had already developed to Understand text.

And this worked really well, and was the basis for many years of rapid improvement in DNN based NLU.

But my theory (in this fictitious story) is that they got too lucky too early.

They went with term vectors because it worked. And never bothered searching for a cheaper alternative.

So these algorithms are starting from the semantics (of terms at the word level) imported from the outside (as gathered by word2vec) and they then attempt to learn the syntax of the language from the main learning corpus. I call these Semantics-First algorithms.

When learning syntax, they will be schlepping around these termvectors. Which is very expensive. Which is why they need to run on powerful and expensive GPUs.

The most important algorithm in a Deep Neural Network stack is Convolution. This is used for correlation discovery. In images, correlation discovery requires that multiple passes be made over the whole image, performing various matrix operations using Linear Algebra.

In text, all possible correlations are in the (linear) past text that has already been read and they can be found using indexing methods such as those used for web search. A more effective indexing method capable of preserving much more context is a neural network using discrete neurons. This is what we use, and is discussed in Chapter 9.

So according to my just-so story, the ML community turned a 1-Dimensional indexed correlation lookup into a 2D convolution that required searching for these correlations. And there���s more: the convolution must be done repeatedly before it converges, because adjusting weights partially invalidates previous efforts.

And these DL algorithms operate in an Euclidean space, which means distance measurements involve squares of hundreds of floating point numbers and square roots. In contrast, my SSMs use Jaccard distance in an even higher-dimensional boolean space. Most of my algorithms are based on set theory.

These are the reasons LLMs cost OpenAI on the order of $Billions to train their LLMs. GPUs are expensive.

Learning language directly, character by character, is easily a million times faster than using termvectors. It produces SSMs instead of LLMs, because it didn���t start with semantics. We know SSMs can handle classification. Can they handle dialog?

Nobody knows.

Are term vectors really necessary for dialog?

Nobody knows.

Or perhaps OpenAI knows.

My algorithm, Organic Learning, has been working since 2017 but I don���t have a machine that is big enough to learn beyond what we needed for classification. We are using 10 years old Apple Macintosh Pro Late 2103 machines for all our research.

OpenAI certainly has the funding, compute, and talent they would need in order to switch to Syntax-First algorithms like mine. There may well be others working on similar ideas, and I predict we will see more research activity in this area now that we know it���s possible to at least get this far.

My company needs a 4TB RAM server with about 220 threads for learning various release versions of classifiers in multiple languages and for experiments aimed at learning enough to be able to conduct a dialog in the style of ChatGPT on a millionth of their budget.

We are self-funded and cannot afford such experiments.

ChatGPT
Monica Anderson's fictional narrative offers an intriguing alternative perspective on the development and evolution of deep learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). This narrative raises several compelling points and questions, a few of which we can delve into:
Evolution of NLP with Deep Learning
: As she posits, the inception of deep learning for NLP began when methods developed for images (like Convolutional Neural Networks) were adapted for text. The process typically involved converting words into vectors (e.g., word2vec) and then feeding them into neural networks.
Semantics-First Algorithms
: Anderson's claim that current mainstream algorithms are "Semantics-First" is an interesting perspective. In essence, she argues that the industry took a direction where the initial representation of text (through word embeddings) is rich in semantics, and then the models try to learn the syntax. The high computational expense is linked to the operation on these semantically rich embeddings.
Syntax-First Approach
: Anderson's approach, on the other hand, is "Syntax-First". She advocates for understanding language at a more granular level, character by character, rather than starting with high-level semantic embeddings. This approach, she claims, is vastly more efficient and can yield similar or even superior models.
Convolution in Text
: The idea that 2D convolutions (designed for images) are overkill for text, which is inherently 1D, is thought-provoking. If this perspective holds, then simpler mechanisms based on indexing or direct correlation lookups might be more efficient than convolutions.
Organic Learning
: Anderson's "Organic Learning" methodology has been functional since 2017, and she seems to indicate that it requires much less computational power than current methods. However, it's unclear from the narrative how Organic Learning works in detail and what its upper limits are.
Challenges Faced
: One of the salient points in Anderson's narrative is the resource challenge. The access to vast computational resources can accelerate research, and organizations with more substantial funding have a distinct advantage in AI research.
Open Questions
: Anderson raises a few key questions: Can her SSM models handle dialog? Are word embeddings essential for dialog? It's evident that these are areas of ongoing investigation and experimentation.
In sum, Anderson's narrative challenges some of the prevailing methodologies in AI research, advocating for a shift in perspective that might yield more efficient models. While the narrative presents an alternative route to understanding language, the broader AI community would likely require empirical evidence to validate and potentially adopt such methods. The exploration of various avenues in AI research, as she's doing, is crucial for innovation and discovering the best practices and methodologies.
Connections with the earlier discussion.

ChatGPT
Absolutely! Let's tie together the previous information from the "Zeroth Principles of AI" article and Monica Anderson's fictional narrative to derive a coherent understanding:
Upsetting the Investors
: Sam Altman's potential announcement about a major shift at OpenAI might align with Monica's assertion regarding the move away from GPU-intensive, semantics-first algorithms. If OpenAI was considering an adoption or exploration of Syntax-First approaches (akin to Monica's Organic Learning), it could indeed lead to a reduced need for GPUs for NLP tasks, thus affecting the GPU market and investors.
GPU-Free Algorithms
: Monica speculates on the possibility that research at OpenAI might have led to the discovery of cheaper GPU-free LLM algorithms. This ties back to her main argument that the current approach of using term vectors is computationally expensive. If OpenAI's potential announcement aligns with this idea, it would validate her theory and could cause a significant shift in the industry.
Alternative to Large Language Models (LLMs)
: Monica introduces the concept of Small Syntax Models (SSMs) as a lightweight, syntax-first alternative to conventional LLMs. If the broader industry, including giants like OpenAI, sees merit in this approach, it could pave the way for more efficient NLP systems, potentially making them more accessible and affordable.
Term Vectors
: Both the article and Monica's narrative underscore the importance of term vectors in current deep learning NLP techniques. While the article mentions term vectors being "overrated," Monica's narrative questions their necessity, especially in dialog systems.
Organic Learning
: Monica's unique approach, Organic Learning, proposes a radically different way of understanding and processing language. While the previous article alludes to the potential of GPU-free algorithms, Monica's narrative provides an example of what one of those algorithms might look like in practice.
Costs of Training LLMs
: The potential high costs associated with training traditional LLMs, as mentioned in the article, align with Monica's argument. A shift toward more efficient techniques, as she proposes, could lead to dramatic cost savings and potentially upset the financial dynamics of the industry, especially those heavily invested in GPU infrastructure.
Future Speculations
: Both the article and Monica's narrative engage in speculations about the future trajectory of AI and NLP. While the article focuses on potential announcements from OpenAI, Monica's narrative gives a deeper dive into the technical reasons behind such speculations.
In essence, Monica Anderson's fictional narrative provides a technical backdrop to the speculations and developments hinted at in the "Zeroth Principles of AI" article. The connections between the two highlight the rapid and often unpredictable evolution of the AI field, with potential shifts that could reshape industry paradigms.
I think it is also highly possible that they don't know about her technique, it
ChatGPT
's just not mainstream or hasn't received enough attention in the broader AI community.
Here are a few considerations:
Recognition and Adoption in AI
: The field of AI is vast, with numerous researchers working on myriad methods and algorithms. While some approaches gain traction quickly due to their effectiveness, backing by major institutions, or media attention, others can remain under the radar despite their potential. Monica's approach, Organic Learning, might be one of those methods that hasn't yet caught the spotlight.
Path Dependency
: Once a technique or approach starts gaining momentum, there's a considerable amount of resources (both monetary and intellectual) invested in that direction. The current deep learning boom and the emphasis on term vectors in NLP could be an example of this. It may make it harder for the community to pivot to an entirely new methodology, even if it promises efficiency.
Proof of Scalability
: While Monica's approach has shown promise, the broader AI community might be waiting to see if it scales well and can be applied to a diverse set of problems. Often, a novel technique gains traction once it's proven at scale or solves a previously intractable problem.
Research Bias
: There's often a bias towards approaches and methodologies that originate from well-known institutions or researchers. It's possible that more attention is paid to what's coming out of renowned universities or major companies like OpenAI, Google, and Facebook. An independent researcher or a small startup might not have the same level of visibility.
Complexity of Change
: Transitioning from one foundational technique to another is not a simple task. Even if OpenAI or any other major institution were to recognize the potential in Monica's technique, the transition would involve significant adjustments to research directions, infrastructure, and training methodologies.
Communication and Outreach
: Sometimes, it's also about how effectively novel techniques are communicated to the broader community. Publishing in top-tier journals, presenting at major conferences, or even collaborating with well-known researchers can boost the visibility of a new methodology.
In conclusion, while Monica Anderson's approach sounds promising, its adoption in mainstream AI research might require a combination of demonstrable success at scale, effective communication, and a broader openness in the community to explore alternative methodologies.
I think she has already said enough that they might be able to reverse engineer her algorthm, but they might not think it is worth the effort
ChatGPT
Certainly, Monica Anderson's discussions provide intriguing insights into her methodology, and organizations like OpenAI could, in theory, take inspiration from her descriptions and potentially reverse engineer or build upon her techniques. Here are a few potential reasons why they might or might not pursue it:
Risk vs. Reward
: Any organization has to weigh the potential benefits of a new technology or method against the risks and costs of developing it. Even if OpenAI could reverse engineer Monica's algorithm, they would need to assess whether the potential improvements in efficiency or capability are worth the resources required.
Current Investments
: OpenAI has invested heavily in its current approach to AI research, especially with models like GPT. Pivoting to or even incorporating a new methodology would have significant implications for their ongoing projects, infrastructure, and overall research direction.
Proof of Concept at Scale
: While Monica's techniques might work well in her described environments, larger organizations might be looking for more extensive proof that such methods can work at the scale and variety of tasks they're interested in.
Intellectual Property Considerations
: Ethical considerations around building upon or reverse engineering someone else's described techniques are significant. Using another researcher's method without proper collaboration, credit, or licensing can lead to controversies or legal issues.
Exploratory Nature of Research
: Research isn't always about finding the most efficient solution immediately. Sometimes, it's about exploring a range of methodologies to understand the landscape better. Even if Monica's approach offers efficiencies, exploring a diverse set of techniques can provide broader insights and potential unexpected breakthroughs.
Potential Collaborations
: If OpenAI or any other major player in the AI space finds significant promise in Monica's techniques, they might approach her for collaboration or partnership, which can be more productive than trying to reverse engineer or independently replicate her work.
Lastly, it's worth noting that the field of AI is vast and diverse. Just because one approach shows promise doesn't mean other methods are invalid or less valuable. The ultimate goal for many in the AI research community is to push the boundaries of what's possible and to continuously evolve our understanding and capabilities in the field.

The most imaginative and creative process we have ever seen is Darwinistic Evolution in nature. It has provided us with octopi and giraffes, to name a few. Human brains and human creativity are pathetic compared to the ingenuity of the Evolution of species.

Selectionist processes dictate which cars we can buy, because car manufacturers are not going to make cars nobody wants to buy. They dictate what available music will sound like, what art we buy, what fiction books we are offered, and what we can see on Netflix.

And in the human mind, novel ideas are generated using variations and mashups of existing ideas and testing them against an existing world model. The best ideas get to breed with other best ideas, and occasionally they will generate offspring ideas that are better than any of the parents. And there may be more than one parent idea. This is known as Neural Darwinism and there are at least 20 books available on the topic. My favorite books are by Prof. Cziko and Prof. William Calvin

This hints at a faster path to AI than any other AI theory. My own systems are 100% Selectionist.

It is significant that it came as a major surprise to many people unfamiliar with Selectionism (including Sam Altman) that AIs would impact the creative arts before impacting Reductionist Science ��� the opposite to what most people expected. This is not a surprise if you have read the Red Pill (see chapter 4.6)
ChatGPT
The concept outlined in the "Selectionist Manifesto" is rooted in the idea that variation and selection drive novelty and innovation. The principles behind it are indeed foundational in many areas of natural and human processes. Let's explore some of the points you've mentioned:
Darwinistic Evolution
: Evolution by natural selection is a powerful force that drives the diversity of life. Through random genetic mutations (variation) and the non-random survival and reproduction of the fittest (selection), we have a wide range of species, each adapted to its environment. This process has led to incredible innovations in nature over billions of years.
Human Systems & Industries
: As you pointed out, market dynamics function through a form of selectionism. Products, whether they're cars, music, art, or movies, evolve based on consumer demand. Products that are not in demand are phased out, while those that are popular thrive and influence future products.
Neural Darwinism
: This is an idea that the brain operates through evolutionary processes. Gerald Edelman, one of the main proponents of this theory, proposed that the brain's neural circuitry undergoes selection processes similar to natural selection. Neurons and their connections (synapses) form a vast array of possibilities, and those that are reinforced by experience survive, while others are pruned.
AI Development Through Selectionist Approaches
: The idea of using evolution-inspired algorithms isn't new in AI. Genetic algorithms, for example, are optimization and search algorithms based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. In such algorithms, potential solutions to a problem go through cycles of mutation, crossover (recombination), and selection to evolve better solutions over generations.
Creative Arts vs. Reductionist Science
: It's an intriguing observation that AI has had a pronounced impact on creative fields. This may be because creativity often involves remixing and recombining existing ideas���something that a selectionist process excels at. On the other hand, reductionist science, which aims to understand the fundamental principles of phenomena, might require a deeper understanding and generalization that goes beyond mere pattern recognition and combination.
The Red Pill Reference
: Without the full context, it's a bit challenging to comment on the specific "Red Pill" mentioned in relation to chapter 4.6. However, in various communities, the term "Red Pill" denotes a form of enlightenment or newfound understanding of underlying realities.
In summary, selectionist processes indeed offer an exciting and potentially effective avenue for various domains, including AI. While other methods and paradigms also have their merits, the idea that novelty arises from the interplay of variation and selection is undeniably influential and has a broad range of applications.
DOMAIN	SCIENCE	THE COMPLEX, INCLUDING THE MUNDANE
Epistemology	Reductionism	Holism
Brains	Reasoning	Understanding
Problem Solving	Plan it, then do it	Just do it
Artificial Intelligence	20th Century GOFAI	Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks
Natural Language In Computers	NLP	NLU
The Problem Solving level provides many familiar examples of these issues. In our mundane lives, we solve many kinds of problems every day but our strategies for solving them fall into just those two categories. For any complicated problem, we had better have a plan before we start. But most problems the brain deals with every day are things we never have to think about. Because we do not need to plan or Reason about them. These are the millions of low-level problems we encounter in our mundane life every day; and this is the world that our AIs will have to operate in.

Consider someone walking across the floor. Their brain signals their leg muscles to contract in the correct cadence. Do they need to consciously plan each step? Do they Reason about how to maintain their balance? No; they probably don't even know what leg muscles they have.

Consider understanding this sentence. Did you use Reasoning? Did you use grammar? If you are a fluent speaker, you do not need grammars to understand or produce language. And you do not have time to Reason about language while hearing it spoken. Reasoning is slow, but Understanding is instantaneous.

Consider someone braking for a stoplight. How hard should they push on the brake pedal? Do they compute the required differential equation? Should such equations be part of the drivers license tests?

Consider someone making breakfast. Did they have to Reason about anything or plan anything, or did they just do what worked yesterday, "without thinking about it"? Without consciously planning it?

Walking and talking, braking and breakfasting, like almost everything we use our brains for, rely on learning from our experiences in order to re-use anything that has worked in the past. And, over time, we learn to correct our mistakes. These strategies are simple enough that we can identify them in other life forms. Dogs Understand a lot but do not Reason much. And we can see how they could be implemented in something like Neurons in brains.

The split in our brains between Reasoning and Understanding was examined at length in "Thinking fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman. The absolute majority of the brain's efforts is spent processing low level sensory input, mostly from the eyes. He calls this "System 1"; it provides Understanding. Reasoning is done by "System 2" based on the Understanding from System 1. But most problems we deal with on a daily basis do not require System 2 at all.
ChatGPT
The dichotomy you presented between "Science" and "The Complex, Including the Mundane" captures a foundational aspect of human cognition and action. It's a reflection of the division in our cognitive processes: one being systematic, deliberate, and analytical, and the other being intuitive, automatic, and based on pattern recognition. Let's dissect the presented categories:
Epistemology
:
Reductionism
: It is the approach where complex phenomena are broken down into simpler components. In scientific terms, it often means studying individual parts to understand the whole.
Holism
: Here, systems are viewed as coherent wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller units. It focuses on the interrelation of all parts.
Brains
:
Reasoning
: This is the analytical and logical aspect of cognition. It is often deliberate and requires effort.
Understanding
: It is the intuitive grasp of concepts, often derived from experiences and previous knowledge.
Problem Solving
:
Plan it, then do it
: A systematic approach where one thinks through a problem, makes a plan, and then executes it.
Just do it
: An intuitive approach, often used for familiar tasks or situations where one acts based on instinct or prior knowledge without much conscious thought.
Artificial Intelligence
:
20th Century GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence)
: Early AI models that relied heavily on symbolic representations and logic-based reasoning.
Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks
: Contemporary AI that learns from data and emphasizes pattern recognition and prediction.
Natural Language In Computers
:
NLP (Natural Language Processing)
: Often seen as the mechanical processing of language, converting text into structured data.
NLU (Natural Language Understanding)
: The ability of machines to understand and generate human language, including its nuances and contexts.
The examples you provided, such as walking across the floor or understanding a sentence, effectively highlight the dichotomy. Most everyday tasks and understandings are governed by what Kahneman referred to as "System 1" - fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, subconscious. On the other hand, "System 2" is slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, and conscious.
Recognizing the division between these two systems is crucial for AI development. For machines to truly "understand" and interact seamlessly with humans, they need to be able to operate in the realm of "System 1" as much as in "System 2". This might involve recognizing patterns, learning from experiences, and making intuitive judgments, while also being able to switch to analytical and deliberate reasoning when necessary.

7. The Red Pill of Machine Learning
Reductionism is the use of Models. Holism is the avoidance of Models. Models are scientific models, theories, hypotheses, formulas, equations, na��ve models based on personal experiences, superstitions (!), and traditional computer programs

7. The Red Pill of Machine Learning
The Deep Learning revolution of 2012 changed how we think about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Neural Networks. What changed, and what does this mean going forward?

The new cognitive capabilities in our machines are the result of a shift in the way we think about problem solving. It is the most significant change ever in Artificial Intelligence (AI), if not in science as a whole. Machine Learning (ML) based systems are successfully attacking both simple and complex problems using novel methods that only became available after 2012.

We are experiencing a revolution at the level of Epistemology which will affect much more than just the field of Machine Learning. We want to add more of these novel methods to our standard problem solving toolkit, but we need to understand the tradeoffs and the conflict.

I argue that understanding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and other ML technologies requires that practitioners adopt a Holistic Stance which is (at important levels) blatantly incompatible with the Reductionist Stance of modern science. As ML practitioners we have to make hard choices that seemingly contradict many of our core scientific convictions. As a result we may get the feeling something is wrong. The conflict is real and important and the seemingly counter-intuitive choices make sense only when viewed in the light of Epistemology. Improved clarity in these matters should alleviate the cognitive dissonance experienced by some ML practitioners and should accelerate progress in these fields.

The title refers to the eye-opening clarity some Machine Learning practitioners achieve when adopting a Holistic Stance.

Parallel Dichotomies
Syntience Inc researches Natural Language Understanding (NLU, in bottom row in table below). We are creating novel systems that allow computers to learn to Understand human natural languages. Any one of them. We use Deep Neural Networks of our own design. The goal is to achieve some kind of human-like but not necessarily human-level Understanding[1]. This is very different from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) which relies on human made Models of some language, such as English, and perhaps Models of fragments of the world. The NLP and NLU disciplines have chosen opposite answers to their difficult two-way choices. They are now defined by these choices, and we can use their stances to highlight the main conflict.

The split is so deep that it cuts through many layers of our reality; the dichotomies listed below are all manifestations of this incompatibility at different levels, listed by impact, but discussed out of order below. (The section above)
ChatGPT
Monica Anderson's excerpt you provided dives deep into the paradigm shift brought about by the advent of deep learning in recent years. Let's break down the central themes and their implications:
Epistemological Revolution
:
Deep Learning represents not just a technological shift but an epistemological one. Epistemology is the study of knowledge ��� its nature, origin, and limits. The rise of Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning challenges traditional methods of gaining and using knowledge.
Reductionism vs. Holism
:
Reductionism
: This perspective attempts to understand complex systems by breaking them down into their constituent parts. It emphasizes models, formulas, and specific rules.
Holism
: Contrary to reductionism, holism tries to understand systems as a whole. In the context of ML, this means understanding data patterns without necessarily reducing them to explicit rules or models.
Conflict in Machine Learning
:
The traditional scientific method, rooted in reductionism, sometimes clashes with the holistic nature of deep neural networks. DNNs are black boxes that recognize patterns without providing explicit rules.
This divergence causes cognitive dissonance for some practitioners. They feel they're departing from the scientific norm, which can be disconcerting.
Natural Language Understanding vs. Processing
:
NLP
: Rooted in models and explicit rules. Traditional NLP systems are built around known grammatical and syntactic rules of a specific language.
NLU
: Aims for machines to truly understand language in a human-like manner. Instead of relying on set rules, NLU systems, especially those based on DNNs, "learn" from vast amounts of data.
The "Red Pill" Metaphor
:
Borrowed from the movie "The Matrix", taking the "red pill" is a symbol for seeing the reality, even if it's uncomfortable or contrary to prior beliefs.
In the context of this piece, the "red pill" represents the realization and acceptance of the holistic approach in ML as opposed to the traditional reductionist method.
In summary, Anderson's article emphasizes the profound change in perspective brought about by modern AI techniques. The adoption of deep learning isn't just a change in tools or algorithms; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach problem-solving, knowledge acquisition, and even the nature of understanding itself. This transformation holds promise for countless applications but also poses challenges, especially for those who must reconcile these new methods with traditional scientific training and beliefs.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Computers can solve any suitable problem when given sufficient human help, such as a complete plan for the solution in the form of a computer program and valid input data.

But since the AI/ML revolution of 2012 we now know how to make computers Understand certain problem domains through Machine Learning. The acquired Understanding allows the machine to "just do it" for many different problems in that domain, without any human planning, Reasoning, or programming, and using incomplete, unreliable, and noisy input data.

This is changing how we are building systems with cognitive capabilities. Everyone working in ML or AI needs to understand the tradeoffs we must make at the most fundamental -- Epistemological -- levels. Modern ML requires examining and seriously re-thinking many things we were taught to vigilantly strive for in our Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educations. Things like "Correlation is bad, but causality is good" and "Do not jump to conclusions on scant evidence" are still solid advice everywhere inside science. But when building Understanding systems, these established strategies and modes of thinking no longer work, because correlation discovery and handling of sparse, unreliable, and inconsistent input data are exactly the kinds of tasks we will have to perform, and perform well, at these pre-scientific levels.

In order to understand how to do this, we must switch to a Holistic Stance.

ChatGPT
The passage you provided delves into the transformative impact of the AI/ML revolution on computational problem-solving and our approach to building cognitive systems. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Traditional Computing
:
Computers, by default, can't think or understand. They require explicit instructions, provided by humans in the form of computer programs, to process and produce outputs. Moreover, they need valid and clean input data to function effectively.
The AI/ML Revolution
:
Post-2012, the landscape of AI underwent significant transformation with the resurgence of neural networks and the rise of deep learning.
Machine Learning has enabled computers to "Understand" certain problem domains. Instead of being programmed explicitly, machines can now learn patterns and underlying structures from data, allowing them to generalize to new, unseen data.
Just Do It
:
Once trained, these AI models can make decisions or predictions on a wide array of problems in the domain they were trained for, even with incomplete or noisy data. They don't need explicit instructions for each new task within that domain.
Epistemological Shift
:
The advent of AI/ML has introduced an epistemological change ��� a change in how we view and acquire knowledge. Traditional scientific and engineering paradigms aren't always directly applicable to the realm of AI/ML.
Rethinking Established Norms
:
Some traditional scientific maxims don't directly apply to ML. For instance, while in traditional scientific contexts, correlation doesn't imply causation, in ML, finding correlations in data is essential and often sufficient for making predictions.
Handling sparse and inconsistent data, previously seen as challenging or problematic, is now a regular part of the ML workflow.
Holistic Stance
:
To fully grasp and effectively employ modern ML, practitioners must adopt a holistic viewpoint. This means looking at systems or problems as wholes rather than the sum of their parts, embracing the nuances and patterns in data, and understanding the inherent trade-offs.
In essence, AI and ML have transformed the landscape of computational problem-solving. While the power of these techniques is undeniable, they also challenge established norms and require a fresh, holistic approach to problem-solving and system design.
A Motivating Example
Beginning Machine Learning students are given exercises like this: They are given a large spreadsheet which lists data about houses sold a certain year in the US. This information includes among other things the zip code of the house, the living area in square feet, lot size, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the year the house was built, and the final sale price of the house.

We would like to be able to predict this final sale price, given the corresponding data for a current house we are about to list for sale. The given spreadsheet is the data the student will use to train a Deep Neural Network. It is the entire learning corpus; it contains everything the system will ever know.

These students can download Deep Neural Network libraries like "Keras" and "TensorFlow", and runnable examples for many kinds of problems , including useful training data, from places like HuggingFace and GitHub. Next the student trains ("learns") their network using the given data. This may take a while. But when learning finishes, they can give the system data for a house it has never seen and it will quite reliably predict what the house might sell for.

This was the goal of the exercise. The student has created a system that Understands how to estimate real estate prices from listings. But the student still does not Understand anything about real estate. The predictive capability (that many people working in real estate would be willing to pay money for) is 100% based on Understanding in the Deep Neural Network ��� In the computer. And because all libraries and many pre-solved examples of this nature were freely available, the student did not have to do much programming either.
ChatGPT
The motivating example showcases a fundamental principle of machine learning and its distinction from traditional programming. Here's a concise breakdown:
Traditional Learning vs Machine Learning
:
In traditional learning, a student studies a subject, assimilates knowledge, and uses that knowledge to solve problems or make decisions. In machine learning, an algorithm (like a Deep Neural Network) learns patterns from data and makes predictions or decisions based on those patterns.
Exercise Overview
:
The task involves predicting house prices based on a set of features (e.g., zip code, living area, lot size, number of bedrooms, year built).
This is a standard regression problem in machine learning.
Deep Learning Libraries
:
Tools like Keras and TensorFlow have democratized machine learning, making it accessible to beginners.
These libraries offer pre-built structures and functions, enabling students to build, train, and test models without needing to understand the intricate details of the underlying algorithms.
Training & Prediction
:
Once the model is trained on the provided data, it can make predictions on new, unseen data.
The model has learned to approximate the relationship between the input features (house details) and the target variable (sale price).
Understanding vs Capability
:
The student has built a system that can predict house prices, which means the system has acquired a kind of "understanding" of the relationship between house details and their prices. However, this understanding is implicit, derived from patterns in data.
Conversely, the student might not have a deep understanding of real estate, market dynamics, or the nuances that drive house prices. They've merely facilitated the machine's learning.
Ease of Access
:
Given the availability of libraries and pre-solved examples, students can achieve results without extensive programming or domain expertise.
This example underscores the power and accessibility of modern machine learning. While traditional education requires explicit knowledge acquisition, machine learning systems can derive implicit understanding from patterns in data, often with remarkable accuracy.
The Vision
This is desirable. This is what AI should mean. The computer Understands the problem so that we don't have to. Programming in the future will be like having a conversation with a competent co-worker, and when the machine Understands exactly what we want done, it will simply do it. No programming required on our part, or on part of the machine, once a suitable (partially Reductionist) framework exists. The rest is learning, and it can be done in any human language with equal ease.

We are on the right track towards something worthy of the name "AI" with current Machine Learning. Going forward, there are thousands of paths to choose from, and the ability to choose wisely will depend on our ability to understand and adopt a Holistic Stance.

Reductionism and Holism
These are important terms of the art in Epistemology. Both of them have numerous correct, useful, and compatible definitions. We will henceforth use the following definitions for reasons of usefulness and simplicity:

Reductionism is the use of Models
Holism is the avoidance of Models
Models are scientific models, theories, hypotheses, formulas, equations, na��ve models based on personal experiences, superstitions (!), and traditional computer programs. In a Reductionist paradigm, these Models are created by humans, ostensibly by scientists, and are then used, ostensibly by engineers, to solve real-world problems. Model creation and Model use both require that these humans Understand the problem domain, the problem at hand, the previously known shared Models available, and how to design and use Models. A Ph.D. degree could be seen as a formal license to create new Models[2]. Mathematics can be seen as a discipline for Model manipulation.

But now -- by avoiding the use of human made Models and switching to Holistic Methods -- data scientists, programmers, and others do not themselves have to Understand the problems they are given. They are no longer asked to provide a computer program or to otherwise solve a problem in a traditional Reductionist or scientific way. Holistic Systems like DNNs can provide solutions to many problems by first learning about the domain from data and solved examples, and then, in production, to match new situations to this gathered experience. These matches are guesses, but with sufficient learning the results can be highly reliable.

We will initially use computer-based Holistic Methods to solve individual and specific problems, such as self-driving cars. Over time, increasing numbers of Artificial Understanders will be able to provide immediate answers -- guesses -- to wider and wider ranges of problems. We can expect to see cellphone apps with such good command of language that it feels like talking to a competent co-worker. Voice will become the preferred way to interact with our personal AIs.

Early and low-level but useful AI will manifest as computers that can solve problems we ourselves cannot (or cannot be bothered to) solve. They need not be superhuman; all they need to have in order to be extremely useful is exactly the ability to autonomously discover higher level abstractions in some given problem domain, starting from low level sensory input, e.g. by learning from images or reading books. Such systems now exist.

If we want to understand Machine Learning, then we need to understand all strategies in the rightmost column in all the tables below. They are all part of a Holistic Stance and if we are working in Machine Learning, we need to adopt as many of them as possible
ChatGPT
The passage presented emphasizes the evolving paradigm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, underscoring the transformation from Reductionist approaches to more Holistic methods. Here's a summary of the main points:
The New Vision of AI
:
The ultimate goal of AI is to create systems that can understand problems as humans do, but without requiring explicit programming. The envisaged future of programming is more of a conversation where the machine, once it understands the intent, executes the task autonomously.
Reductionism vs. Holism
:
Reductionism
: Relies on the creation and use of human-made models. These models, whether scientific, mathematical, or computational, aim to break complex phenomena into simpler components, thereby making them understandable and solvable.
Holism
: Focuses on understanding systems or problems in their entirety, without breaking them down into simpler components. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a representation of holistic systems, learn patterns from vast amounts of data without relying on explicit, human-made models.
Role Reversal for Professionals
:
Traditional problem-solving required professionals like data scientists and programmers to understand the problem deeply and devise solutions (often involving models). With DNNs and other holistic methods, the professionals merely set up systems that learn and understand from data, removing the need for them to grasp every intricacy of the problem.
Applicability of Holistic AI
:
Initially, AI systems based on holistic methods will solve specific problems, e.g., self-driving cars.
Over time, these AI systems will become more generalized, capable of addressing a wider array of challenges. This might manifest as conversational AI assistants that can converse fluidly, making voice a primary mode of interaction.
Significance of Early AI Systems
:
The initial AI systems might not be superhuman but will be adept at abstracting high-level concepts from low-level data, such as deriving insights from images or textual data. Such systems are already in existence.
Embracing the Holistic Stance
:
To genuinely comprehend and excel in the domain of machine learning, professionals must familiarize themselves with and adopt the strategies and perspectives aligned with the holistic stance. This involves moving away from the traditional reductionist approaches and embracing the holistic methods that characterize modern AI and ML.
In essence, the article sheds light on the transformative nature of AI and ML, emphasizing the need to move from traditional model-based methods to embracing systems that learn and understand in a holistic manner.
Differences at the Level of Epistemology
REDUCTIONISM / SCIENCE	HOLISM / MACHINE LEARNING
1.1	The use of Models	The avoidance of Models
1.2	Reasoning	Understanding
1.3	Requires Human Understanding	Provides Human-like Understanding
1.4	Problems are solved in an abstract Model space	Problems are solved directly in the problem domain
1.5	Unbeatable strategy for dealing with a wide range of suitable problems faced by humans	May handle some problems in domains where Reductionist Models cannot be created or used, known as "Bizarre Domains"
1.6	Handles many important complicated problems such as going to the Moon or a highway system	Handles many important complex problems such as protein folding and playing Go.
1.7	Handles problems requiring planning or cooperation	Handles simple mundane problems such as Understanding language or vision, or making breakfast
Many rows in these tables discuss hard tradeoffs where compromises are impossible or prohibitively expensive; these are identified by boldface numbers in the first column. Remaining rows may not be clear tradeoffs or even disjoint alternatives. Mixed systems are described in a separate chapter.

1.1, 1.2, 1.3: These form the core of these dichotomies and are discussed in most of what follows but also in detail at the AI Epistemology introductory chapter and in videos of talks.

1.4: A weather report is based on Models in meteorology. To solve the problem directly in the problem domain, open a window to check if it smells like rain.

1.5 is also discussed in table 3 below and in the Bizarre Systems video. A summary:

Reductionism is the greatest invention our species has ever made. But Reductionist Models cannot be created or used when any one of a multitude of blocking issues are present. Models work "in theory" or "in a laboratory" where we can isolate a device, organism, or phenomenon from a changing environment. However, complex situations may involve tracking and responding to a large number of conflicting and unreliable signals from a constantly changing world or environment. Reductionism is here at a severe disadvantage and can rarely perform above the level of statistical Models.

In contrast, Holistic Machine Learning Methods learning from unfiltered inputs can discover correlations that humans might miss, and can construct internal pattern-based structures to provide recognition, Epistemic Reduction, abstraction, prediction, noise rejection, and other cognitive capabilities.

1.6, 1.7 : Humans generally use Holistic Methods for seemingly simple (but in reality, complex) mundane problems, like Understanding vision, human language, learning to walk, or making breakfast. Computers use them for very complex problems (ML based AI in general, such as protein folding and playing go) but also simpler ones, such as Real Estate pricing.
ChatGPT
The table presented elucidates the epistemological differences between Reductionism (traditional scientific methods) and Holism (modern machine learning approaches). Here's a distilled explanation of the points made:
1.1, 1.2, 1.3
:
Reductionism
emphasizes the creation and use of models, reasoning, and requires human understanding. These are pre-established frameworks or theories where information is fit into.
Holism
in machine learning, on the other hand, actively avoids such predefined models. Instead, it thrives on deriving understanding from data. The machine 'understands' by recognizing patterns and correlations in vast datasets.
1.4
:
Reductionism
tackles problems in an abstract space based on models. For example, predicting weather based on meteorological models.
Holism
addresses problems directly in their domain. It would be like directly sensing or observing the weather rather than relying on predictive models.
1.5
:
Reductionism
is a powerful tool for problems where the environment can be controlled, and variables can be isolated. However, in complex situations with myriad, conflicting signals, reductionist models often struggle and may at best provide statistical approximations.
Holism
, with machine learning, excels in such complex situations. ML can unearth correlations even in noisy, vast data, and build internal patterns for recognition, prediction, and more.
1.6, 1.7
:
Reductionism
is employed for significant complicated problems that have a clear path or solution, such as landing on the moon or developing infrastructure.
Holism
, especially in humans, is instinctively used for seemingly straightforward but inherently complex tasks like understanding languages or preparing breakfast. Machines employ holistic methods for both simple tasks (e.g., predicting real estate prices) and complex challenges (like protein folding or mastering the game of Go).
In essence, while Reductionism and Science break down problems into simpler components to understand and solve them, Holism and Machine Learning aim to understand problems in their entirety, often dealing with complexity head-on. Both approaches have their merits and areas of applicability, but the surge in AI and ML indicates a growing shift towards holistic problem-solving in many domains.
learns from its mistakes. In Machine Learning, a larger learning corpus is in general better than a smaller one because it provides more opportunities for making mistakes to learn from, such as corner cases.

2.4: Models created by humans have manageable numbers of parameters because the scientist or engineer working on the problem has done a (hopefully correct) Epistemic Reduction from a complex and messy world to a computable Model. This allows experimentation with what-if scenarios by varying Model parameters. It is up to the Model user to determine which extrapolations are reasonable.

In Holistic ML systems we are getting used to systems with millions or billions of parameters. These structures are very difficult to analyze, and just like with human intelligences, the best way to estimate their competence is through testing. Extrapolation is typically out of scope for Holistic systems.

2.5: The majority of end users will have no interest in how some machine came up with some obviously correct answer; they will just accept it, the way we accept our own Understanding of language, even though we do not know how we do it.

2.6: We now find ourselves asking our machines to solve problems we either don't know how to solve, or can't be bothered to figure out how to solve.

We have reached a major benefit of AI -- we can be positively ignorant of many mundane things and will be happy to delegate such matters to our machines so that we may play, or focus on more important things.

Some schools of thought tend to overvalue explainability. To them, ML is a serious step down from results obtained scientifically where we can all inspect the causality ��� for instance in Reductionist production ("expert") systems.

But the bottom line is that today we can often choose between Understanding the problem domain, problem, the use of science and relevant Models, and the answer.

Or just getting a useful answer without even bothering to Understand the problem or the problem domain.

The latter (Positive Ignorance) is a lot closer to AI than the first, and we can expect the use of Holistic Methods to continue to increase.

2.7 : Science strives towards a consensus world Model in order to facilitate communication and minimize costly engineering mistakes caused by ignorance and misunderstandings. Scientific communication requires a high-level context ���  a World Model ���  shared by participants, and agreed-upon signals such as words, math, and software.

But direct Understanding, such as the skills to become a chess grandmaster or a downhill skier, cannot be shared using words -- the experience must be acquired using individual practice. Computer based systems that learn a skill through practice can share the entire Understanding so acquired by copying the memory content to another machine.
ChatGPT
The points presented focus on the distinct differences between traditional human-created models (Reductionism) and holistic machine learning systems. Here's a condensed interpretation:
2.4
:
Reductionist Models
: These are typically designed by humans with a limited number of parameters. The human designer simplifies the complex real-world problem into a computable model, allowing for experimental simulations. Users of these models need to decide the boundaries within which the models provide accurate results.
Holistic ML Systems
: These machine learning systems can have millions or even billions of parameters, making them intricate to comprehend. Much like understanding a human's intelligence, gauging their performance is best done through testing. These systems generally do not extrapolate well beyond their training data.
2.5
:
Most end-users are more interested in the solution provided by the machine rather than the process behind it. It's akin to how we understand language naturally without knowing the underlying neurological processes.
2.6
:
One significant advantage of AI is its capacity to solve problems that we either don't understand or prefer not to invest time in understanding. There's a growing acceptance of relying on AI for answers, even if we don't understand the intricacies of the problem or the solution. This "Positive Ignorance" signifies a shift closer to true AI, where machines provide solutions without humans needing a deep understanding.
There's a debate on the importance of explainability in machine learning. Some value the transparency of reductionist systems, where causality is clear, over black-box ML systems. Yet, the undeniable benefit of holistic methods is that they offer valuable solutions without the necessity for understanding the problem intricacies.

Science aims for a consensus or a shared understanding, which is crucial for clear communication and avoiding costly mistakes. This shared knowledge consists of agreed-upon terminologies, mathematical equations, software, and more.
However, direct experiential understanding, like mastering chess or skiing, cannot be shared through mere words or explanations. It requires individual experience and practice. But for computer-based systems, this understanding, once learned, can be shared by merely copying the data to another system, thus multiplying the expertise without additional training.
In essence, the narrative underscores a transformative shift in problem-solving ��� from understanding every aspect of a problem to relying on AI systems that provide solutions without the need for human comprehension of the problem's intricacies.
able to detect what is salient (important) in their input in order to avoid paying attention to -- and learning from -- noise. And they have to deal with incomplete, erroneous, and misleading input generated by millions of other intelligent agents with goals at odds with their own. They need to be able to detect omissions, duplications, errors, noise, lies, etc and the only Epistemologically plausible way to do this is to relate the input to similar input they have understood in the past -- what they already know. They need to understand what matters but if they can also Understand some of the noise ("This is advertising"), they can exploit that.

There are many image and video apps available featuring Image Understanding based on Deep Learning. These apps can remove backgrounds, sharpen details like eyelashes, restore damaged photographs, etc. We need to keep in mind that the ability of Holistic systems to fill in data and detect noise depends on them having learned from similar data in the past. We note that all the image improvements are confabulations based on prior experience from their learning corpora. But we can also note that image composition using these methods yields totally seamless images, very far from cut-and-paste of pixels.

And quite similarly, we find language confabulation by systems like GPT-3 to flow seamlessly between sentences and topics. They have nothing to say, but they say it well. However, they bring us closer to meaningful language generation and when we achieve that, the public perception of what computers are capable of will totally change.

3.3: Most of Cognition is Re-Cognition. Being able to recognize that something has occurred before and knowing what might happen next has enormous survival value for any animal species. A mature human has used their eyes and other senses for decades; this represents an enormous learning corpus and they can Understand anything they have prior experience of. The mistakes made by humans, animals and by Holistic ML systems are very often of a "near miss" variety which provides an opportunity to learn to do it better next time.

Contrast this to Reductionist software systems created for similar goals. Rule based systems have long been infamous for their Brittleness. As long as the rules in the ruleset match the current input and reality perfectly, the results will be useful, repeatable and reliable. But at the edges of their competence, where the matches become more tenuous, the quality rapidly drops. Minor mistakes in the rule sets (in the World Modeling) may lead such systems to return spectacularly incorrect results.
ChatGPT
The passage delves into the intricacies of how AI, especially those based on holistic methods like deep learning, process and generate information, and contrasts it with reductionist methods. Here's a summary:
Intelligent Processing
: AI systems need to distinguish between significant information and noise. They must handle incomplete or misleading inputs, often generated by other intelligent entities with conflicting objectives. The only feasible method for handling such challenges epistemologically is by referring to similar inputs that the system has previously understood. This helps the system understand what's crucial and sometimes even exploit recognizable noise patterns (e.g., discerning advertisements).
Image Understanding
: Many apps use deep learning for image processing. They can remove backgrounds, enhance details, and restore damaged photos. The effectiveness of these systems in generating or restoring image data hinges on their training from similar data. The improvements they make on images are based on their prior learnings and experience. Unlike mere pixel-based operations, these AI-driven enhancements create seamless and realistic results.
Language Generation
: Systems like GPT-3 generate language content that flows smoothly, even if they lack a genuine intent or message. Though the content might sometimes seem void of original thought, their ability to create contextually relevant and coherent sentences is a leap towards genuine language generation. Once AI achieves truly meaningful language generation, it will revolutionize how the public perceives computer capabilities.
Re-Cognition
: The core of cognition lies in recognition. Recognizing patterns and predicting subsequent events based on past experiences is crucial for survival across species. Humans have decades of sensory experience, forming an extensive learning corpus that aids understanding. Mistakes, whether by humans, animals, or AI, often serve as learning opportunities, especially when they are "near misses" which can be rectified in subsequent instances.
Contrasting with Reductionist Systems
: Reductionist systems, especially rule-based ones, are notorious for their fragility or "brittleness". They work impeccably when the rules perfectly match the current scenario. However, as the context starts deviating from the rules, their performance deteriorates quickly. A minor oversight in rule definition can lead these systems to produce drastically wrong outputs.
In essence, holistic machine learning methods exhibit more adaptability and resilience in the face of ambiguous or misleading data compared to rigid reductionist systems.
simple enough, such as just incrementing a value, we can forego thread safety and locking since the worst outcome is the loss of a single increment in a system that uses emergent results from millions of such values, and the mistake would (in a well designed system) be self-correcting in the long run. At the cloud level, absolute consistency may not be as hard a requirement as it is for Reductionist systems. Much larger mistakes can be expected to be attributable to misunderstandings of the corpus or poor corpus coverage.
ChatGPT
The passage touches upon the topic of consistency in distributed systems, specifically within the context of machine learning or AI systems. Here's a brief summary:
When dealing with certain simple operations, such as incrementing a value, the need for thread safety and locking can sometimes be relaxed in systems that rely on the emergent properties resulting from the processing of vast amounts of data. This is because a minor error, like missing a single increment, is unlikely to have a significant overall impact. Moreover, well-designed systems should be able to self-correct such errors over time. In cloud-based architectures, where distributed processing is the norm, absolute consistency might not always be as stringent a requirement as it is in traditional reductionist systems. Larger errors in these systems are more likely to arise from misunderstandings or poor coverage of the training data (corpus) rather than small synchronization issues.
complex problem domain because life itself is complex. Some say "Biology has Physics envy" because in the life sciences, Reductionist Models are difficult to create and justify. OTOH, "Physics is for simple problems."

Problems with many complex interdependencies and unknown webs of causality can now be attacked using Deep Neural Networks. These systems discover useful correlations and may often find solutions using mere hints in the input which match their prior experience; Reductionist strategies with correctness requirements outlaw this. It is notable that one of the larger triumphs of Holistic Methods is Protein Folding, which is a problem at the very core of the life sciences.

So Holistic Understanding of a complex system can be acquired by observing it over time and learning from its behavior. There is no need to split the problem into pieces. Part of the Holistic Stance is that we give the machine everything -- "holism" comes from greek �������� -- "the whole" -- i.e. all the information we have. If we start filtering the input data -- "cleaning it up" -- then the system will effectively learn from a Pollyanna version of the world, which will be confusing once it has to deal with real-life inputs in a production environment. If we want our machines to learn to Understand the world all by themselves, then we should not start by applying heavy-handed heuristic cleanup operations of our own design on their input data
ChatGPT
This passage highlights the comparison between Reductionist and Holistic approaches, especially in the context of understanding complex systems. Here's a concise summary:
Life sciences pose complex challenges, often eluding simple Reductionist models, leading to the quip that "Biology has Physics envy," given the relative simplicity and exactness of physics models. On the other hand, Holistic methods, like Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can address problems riddled with intricate interdependencies without needing to understand every detail. A significant accomplishment of DNNs in this realm is solving Protein Folding, a central issue in biology.
The Holistic approach emphasizes the importance of observing and learning from a system's behavior over time without breaking it down. In alignment with the essence of holism (derived from the Greek word ��������, meaning "the whole"), the approach suggests feeding machines with all available information. Preemptively filtering or "cleaning up" data might lead to machines learning from a sanitized or overly optimistic version of reality, which can be problematic when transitioning to real-world applications. For genuine autonomous understanding, machines should be provided with unfiltered data to ensure they learn the complexities of the real world.
Experimental Epistemology
"Epistemology is the theory of knowledge. It is concerned with the mind's relation to reality."

This includes artificial minds. An introduction to Epistemology should benefit anyone working in the AI/ML field.

Scientific statements look like "F=ma" (Newton's second law) or E=mc2 (Einstein's famous equation) and can all be proven and/or derived from other accepted results, or verified experimentally.

Algebra is built on lemmas that are not part of Algebra; they cannot be proven inside of Algebra.

Similarly, Epistemological statements are not provable in science because science is built on top of Epistemology. But when science is not helping, such as in Bizarre Domains, then setting scientific methodology aside and "dropping down to the level of Epistemology" sometimes works.

Epistemology is, just like Philosophy in general, an armchair thinking exercise and the results are judged on internal coherence and consistency with other accepted theory rather than by proofs or experiments.

However, the availability of Understanding Machines such as DNNs now suddenly provides the opportunity for actual experiments in Epistemology. Consider the below statements from the domain of Epistemology, and how each of them can be viewed as an implementation hint for AI designers. We are already able to measure their effects on system competence.
ChatGPT
The discourse underscores the intersection between the realm of Epistemology and the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here's a brief breakdown:
Epistemology and Its Relevance to AI:
Definition:
Epistemology deals with the nature and scope of knowledge and how we, including artificial entities, relate to reality.
Importance:
Anyone involved in the AI/ML sector can benefit from an understanding of epistemology, as it provides foundational insights into knowledge representation and understanding.
Connection to Science and Algebra:
Scientific claims, like Newton's or Einstein's equations, are verifiable through proof, derivation, or experimentation.
Algebra relies on foundational lemmas that exist outside its own framework and can't be proven within it.
Similarly, epistemological statements can't be proven scientifically since science itself is constructed upon epistemological principles.
Bridging the Gap with Experimental Epistemology:
Traditional epistemology, much like philosophy, is often considered a theoretical pursuit, valuing internal coherence over empirical validation.
However, with the advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and other AI systems, there's an unprecedented opportunity to delve into 'experimental epistemology.'
These AI technologies enable researchers to test and refine epistemological theories practically, offering tangible feedback on how certain knowledge structures and methodologies impact AI performance.
In essence, as AI technology advances, the traditional boundaries of epistemology are expanded. Not only can epistemological principles guide AI design, but AI can also, in return, offer empirical insights into our understanding of knowledge itself.

"You can only learn that which you already almost know" -- Patrick Winston, MIT

"All intelligences are fallible" -- Monica Anderson

"In order to detect that something is new you need to recognize everything old" -- Monica Anderson

"You cannot Reason about that which you do not Understand" -- Monica Anderson

"You are known by the company you keep" -- Simple version of Yoneda Lemma from Category Theory and the justification for embeddings in Deep Learning

"All useful novelty in the universe is due to processes of variation and selection" -- The Selectionist manifesto. Selectionism is the generalization of Darwinism. This is why Genetic Algorithms work.

Science "has no equations" for concepts like Understanding, Reasoning, Learning, Abstraction, or Modeling since they are all Epistemology level concepts. We cannot even start using science until we have decided what Model to use. We must use our experience to perform Epistemic Reductions, discarding the irrelevant, starting from a messy real world problem situation until we are left with a scientific Model we can use, such as an equation. The focus in AI research should be on exactly how we can get our machines to perform this pre-scientific Epistemic Reduction by themselves.

And the answer to that can not be found inside of science.

Artificial General Intelligence
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) was a theoretical 20th Century Reductionist AI attempt to go beyond the "Narrow AI" of domain specific expert systems -- closer to the "General Intelligence" they thought humans had. The term was mostly used by independent researchers, amateurs and enthusiasts.

But the "AGI" term was not well enough defined and was not backed by sufficient theory to provide any AI implementation guidance and what little progress had been made by these groups was overtaken by Holistic Methods after 2012.

Today we know that the entire premise of 20th century Reductionist AGI was wrong:

��� Humans are not General Intelligences...

at birth.

Instead, we are General Learners, capable of learning almost any skill or knowledge required in a wide range of problem domains. If we want human-compatible cognitive systems, then we should build them in our image in this respect. To build machines that learn and jump to conclusions on scant evidence.

Decades ago, "AGI" implied a human-programmed Reductionist hand-coded program based on Logic and Reasoning that can solve any problem because the programmers anticipated it. To argue against claims that this was impossible, the AGI community came up with the promise or threat of self-improving AI[5].

But the amount of code in our cognitive systems has shrunk from 6 million propositions in CYC around 1990 to 600 lines of code to play video games around 2017 to about 13 lines of Keras code in some research reports. And now there's AutoML and other efforts at eliminating all remaining programming from ML.

The problems are not in the code. There is almost no code left to improve in modern Machine Learning systems. All that matters is the corpus. We can now (after 2012) see that Machine Learning is an absolute requirement for anything worthy of the name "AI".

Which makes recursive self-improvement leading to evil superhuman omniscient logic-based godlike AGIs a 20th century Reductionist AI myth.

We must focus on AGL .

Afterword
Science was created to stop people from overrating correlations and jumping to erroneous conclusions on scant evidence and then sharing those conclusions with others, leading to compounded mistakes and much wasted effort.

Consequently, promoting a Holistic Stance has long been a career-ending move in academia, and especially in Computer Science. But now we suddenly have Machine Learning that performs cognitive tasks such as protein folding, playing Go, and estimating house prices at useful levels using exactly a Holistic Stance.

So now Science itself has a cognitive dissonance. This is a conflict about what Science is. Or should be.

Ignorance of these stances leads people to develop significant personal cognitive dissonances which is why discussions about these issues are very unpopular among people with solid STEM educations. But the dichotomy is real; we need to deal with it. Our choices so far seem to have been

claim the dichotomy doesn't exist (... but Schr��dinger and Pirsig also discuss it)
claim that the Holistic Stance doesn't work (... but Deep Learning works)
claim that Reductionist methods are a requirement (... hobbling our toolkits for a principle)
The Reductionist Stance also makes it difficult to imagine and accept things like

Systems capable of autonomous Epistemic Reduction
Systems that do not have a goal function
Systems that improve with practice
Systems that exploit emergent effects
Systems that by themselves make decisions about what matters most
Systems that occasionally give a wrong answer but are nevertheless very useful
So after a serious education in Machine Learning we don't actually need to do almost any programming at all, and we don't need to understand anybody else's problem domains. Because we don't have to perform any Epistemic Reduction ourselves.

We should recognize this for what it is. AI was supposed to solve our problems for us so we would not have to learn or understand any new problem domains. To not have to think. And that's what we have today, in Machine Learning, and with Holistic Methods in general. Why are some people surprised or unhappy about this? In my opinion, this is AI, this is what we have been trying to accomplish for decades.

People who claim "Machine Understanding is not AI" are asking for human-level human-centric Reasoning and are, at their peril, blind to the nascent ML based Understanding we can achieve today.

With expected reasonable improvements in Machine Understanding capabilities, familiarity and acceptance of the Holistic Stance will become a requirement for ML/AI based work. It will likely take years for our educational system to adjust.
ChatGPT
The extensive discourse you've presented touches upon several profound themes at the intersection of philosophy, epistemology, and the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Let's distill the key points:
Epistemology and AI
:
Epistemology, the study of knowledge, is vital for understanding how both human and artificial minds relate to reality.
While science offers provable or verifiable statements, epistemological claims exist as a foundation beneath scientific principles. This raises challenges in "Bizarre Domains" where the scientific method might not apply directly.
Experimental Epistemology
:
The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has created a space for experimenting with epistemological ideas. Quotes from scholars like Patrick Winston and Monica Anderson offer insights that can be used as guidelines for AI design.
The essence is to focus on how machines can autonomously filter and prioritize information, discerning what's essential from real-world chaos, before forming a scientific model.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
:
AGI was conceived as an AI form that could replicate human-like intelligence across varied domains.
However, the idea of AGI, as imagined in the 20th century, was rooted in reductionism and hand-coded logic, which is now viewed as a flawed approach.
Today, it's understood that humans are "General Learners," indicating that machines should be designed to learn adaptively rather than "know" everything from the outset.
The shift towards minimal coding in machine learning and the emphasis on data (corpus) suggests that future AI systems will be even more adaptive, learning-based entities.
Reductionism vs. Holism in AI
:
Reductionism attempts to break complex systems into simpler parts to understand and manage them. This approach has dominated scientific thinking for centuries.
Holistic approaches, on the other hand, advocate for understanding systems in their entirety. With the rise of deep learning, holistic methods are proving effective in domains like protein folding and game playing.
There's a growing realization that certain challenges in AI, such as epistemic reduction, can't be solved purely by reductionist methods. AI systems that can improve with practice, make decisions on priorities, and even occasionally err (yet remain useful) lean more towards a holistic stance.
Future of AI Education
:
Given the success of holistic methods in AI, the current educational paradigm might need revision. The emphasis would shift from hand-coding solutions to understanding and facilitating autonomous learning in machines.
The concluding argument suggests that the ultimate goal of AI was always to offload cognitive burdens from humans. With machine learning and holistic methods, this goal seems closer than ever.
In summary, as AI continues to evolve, understanding its philosophical underpinnings becomes crucial. The dichotomy between reductionism and holism, and the potential of experimental epistemology, offers rich avenues for exploration in both AI design and education.

Combining both summaries, this provides a comprehensive overview of the range of topics we've covered in our discussion.
Connections between the topics.
ChatGPT
Certainly, the topics we've discussed are interconnected in several ways. Here's an analysis of the connections between them:
Organic Learning & Algorithm Security
:
Both revolve around understanding and manipulating the underlying mechanisms of AI. While Organic Learning focuses on the AI's innate capabilities, Algorithm Security touches on the ethics and feasibility of delving deeper into proprietary algorithms.
Reductionism vs. Holism & Monica Anderson's Article
:
Monica Anderson's perspective on AI and ML heavily leans towards the holistic approach, which was one of the main discussions in the Reductionism vs. Holism topic. Her stance emphasizes understanding over reasoning and is more in line with System 1 (as described by Kahneman) than System 2.
The article posits that traditional AI methods, rooted in reductionism, might be limiting, and the shift towards holistic methods (like DNNs) represents an evolution in AI philosophy.
The Selectionist Manifesto & Reductionism vs. Holism
:
The Selectionist Manifesto, which suggests that novelty arises from processes of variation and selection, can be seen as a holistic concept. It argues against the idea of a singular "best" solution and instead proposes a more dynamic, emergent process, similar to evolution.
This evolutionary approach contrasts with reductionist methods which often aim to break down problems to their most basic components, potentially missing emergent phenomena.
Monica Anderson's Article & Algorithm Security
:
Anderson's views on AI learning organically from raw, unfiltered data can be linked to the topic of algorithm security. If AI systems are trained on raw data and make decisions based on holistic understanding, it may become even harder to reverse-engineer or understand the decision-making processes, enhancing security.
Organic Learning & Reductionism vs. Holism
:
The concept of AI having organic learning capabilities ties in with the holistic approach. Instead of being explicitly programmed (reductionist approach), the AI learns and grows organically, mirroring the System 1 thinking of intuition and quick decision-making.
Artificial General Intelligence & All Topics
:
The discussion about AGI and its evolution touches on all the topics. AGI's initial premise, based on reductionist thinking, aimed for machines with general intelligence capabilities. However, the shift towards holistic methods and machine learning, as well as considerations about algorithm security and organic learning, has reshaped the AGI landscape.
In summary, the connections highlight the tension and evolution in the AI field between traditional reductionist methods and emergent holistic approaches, both in terms of theory and practical application.

The blend of these elements promises more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly AI systems in the future.
Broadcasting in chat system without topic-specific rooms
Abstract
A method, system, and graphical user interface for a chat system is disclosed. A server with processor(s) and memory obtains a plurality of incoming messages, where the plurality of incoming messages include one or more external messages and one or more in-system messages from authors in the communication system, the one or more external messages are generated from one or more external sources. The server identifies one or more messages from a first author among the plurality of incoming messages in the communication system and receives a feedback message from a first user of the communication system about at least one of: the first author and a first message of the one or more popular messages. The server sends to a plurality of users of the communication system the first message and the feedback message from the first user, where the plurality of users track the first author

InventorMonica AndersonCurrent Assignee Google LLC
ChatGPT
This abstract outlines a method, system, and graphical user interface for a chat system, particularly focused on broadcasting messages without the need for topic-specific rooms.
Main Concepts
:
Incoming Messages
: The chat system can obtain various messages, both from within the system itself (in-system messages) and from external sources (external messages).
Identification of Author's Messages
: Among all the incoming messages, the system can identify those from a specific author.
Feedback Mechanism
: A user can provide feedback on either the specific message from the author or on the author themselves.
Broadcasting
: The chat system then broadcasts both the message from the author and the feedback received from the user to a wider audience (plurality of users) that follows or tracks the said author.
Implications and Use Cases
:
Streamlined Communication
: Instead of segregating messages into topic-specific rooms, this approach allows for a more free-flowing and dynamic interaction, where the focus is on the authors and the content they generate.
Dynamic Feedback
: By integrating user feedback, the system allows for a two-way communication channel. This could be especially valuable in a public forum where users may want to agree, disagree, or further discuss a topic introduced by an author.
Enhanced Engagement
: Since users can track specific authors, it ensures they receive content most relevant to their interests, leading to increased user engagement.
Incorporation of External Sources
: The system's ability to integrate external messages ensures it isn't limited to just the in-system content, making it a more comprehensive communication platform.
Considering Monica Anderson's background in AI and dialog systems, and with the current assignee being Google LLC, this could potentially be a novel approach to chat systems that goes beyond traditional chat rooms, enabling more dynamic, interest-based interactions. It could be especially relevant for platforms that want to incorporate content from external sources (e.g., news articles, blogs) and stimulate discussions around them within their user community.

: Despite the dual origin, messages are shown within one single context, or unified interface, to the user.
Implications and Potential Use Cases
:
Increased Awareness
: By integrating messages from nearby chat rooms, users are made aware of other discussions or topics that are taking place close to their primary chat room. This can stimulate curiosity and exploration.
Enhanced Engagement
: Users might discover more topics or conversations of interest and, as a result, might spend more time within the chat system.
Fluid Transitions
: Users can smoothly transition between chat rooms or topics as they are already exposed to content from nearby rooms, making the experience more fluid.
Real-Time Trend Detection
: In dynamic environments, this system could highlight emerging trends or hot topics as they gain traction in nearby rooms.
Contextual Understanding
: For users who are part of multiple related chat rooms, this approach can provide a more holistic view of the discussions, aiding in understanding the broader context.
Design Considerations
:
Given that messages from different chat rooms are integrated into one context, the design of the interface is crucial.
Message Differentiation
: Users should easily differentiate between messages from their current room and those from nearby rooms. This could be achieved using different colors, icons, or other visual cues.
Managing Information Overload
: To avoid overwhelming users with too many messages, there could be filters or settings to control the flow or relevancy of messages from nearby rooms.
Seamless Integration
: The transition from reading a message from a nearby room to joining that room should be intuitive and seamless.
Considering Monica Anderson's involvement, this design likely leans towards leveraging AI and smart algorithms to ensure the user experience is smooth and the information presented is relevant. Given her expertise in dialog systems and AI, the underlying mechanics might also include smart content prioritization or recommendation algorithms.
entitled ���Chat Room 
with Thin Walls, which is hereby incorporated by reference 
in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD 
The disclosed embodiments relate generally to chat sys 
tems. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to 
methods, systems, and user interfaces for allowing a user to 
receive messages from various chat rooms, and the messages 
are displayed in a single context to the user. 
BACKGROUND 
Chat system technology, commonly referred to as online 
chat, allows users to communicate in near-real time over a 
network, such as the Internet or an intranet. The most com 
mon forms of online chat are direct, one-to-one chat, com 
monly referred to as instant messaging (or "IM), and chat 
rooms. A chat room allows multiple users to communicate 
synchronously within the confines of the chat room. 
User interactions in chat room systems include: entering a 
particular chat room as an active user to type in messages 
and/or view messages, replying to messages in a chat room, 
saving messages displayed during a chat session, and Switch 
ing to a different chat room. 
When a user is interested in conversing with other users 
(participants) in a particular chat room, the user enters the 
room either as a registered user or as a guest. Each participant 
of the particular chat room sees a message window for that 
chat room. Participants��� messages appear in the message 
window in the order that the messages are posted. A user can 
respond to a recent message by posting a reply in a response 
dialog box. In a chat client, the newest messages are displayed 
either at the top or bottom of the message window. A message 
window will display a pre-determined number of messages. 
When the maximum number of messages is reached, older 
messages are scrolled off the message window to make room 
for newer messages as they are posted. Once a message has 
scrolled off the message window, Such a message typically 
cannot be redisplayed. 
There are many different technologies for implementing 
chat systems. One common chat technology is referred to as 
IRC, short for ���Internet Relay Chat.��� IRC is a client-server 
technology in which users must use a specific IRC client 
program to select and log in to chat rooms. IRC chat clients 
and chat server employ the TCP/IP (Internet) protocol for 
communications. Web-based chat technologies are also avail 
able. 
In current chat systems, if a user wishes to participate in 
multiple chat rooms, the user must open multiple sessions to 
keep track of different chat rooms. Further, the current tech 
nology does not provide a convenient way for automatically 
determining which chat rooms/conversations are likely to be 
of interest to the user.

This text discusses a novel approach to chat room technology, which, in essence, seeks to offer a more dynamic and interconnected chat experience by allowing users to view and engage with messages from multiple chat rooms in a singular context. Here are some key points and features discussed:
Thin Walls Concept
: The idea of "Chat Room with Thin Walls" suggests that while users are in one chat room, they can still be passively exposed to messages and discussions happening in "nearby" chat rooms, thereby breaking down the traditional "walls" or barriers of individual chat rooms.
Current Chat Technologies
: Traditional chat systems, such as IRC (Internet Relay Chat), generally require users to be in one specific chat room at a time. If a user wants to participate in multiple chat rooms, they'd have to juggle multiple sessions.
Nearby Chat Rooms
: The term ���nearby��� does not solely refer to spatial proximity but can encompass various criteria:
User-defined criteria for what qualifies as ���nearby���.
Chat rooms that are within a certain hierarchy or graph proximity.
Chat rooms discussing similar topics or themes.
Chat rooms with certain active user thresholds or message volumes.
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
: A dedicated GUI would be used to display messages from the primary chat room and those from nearby rooms in a unified context. The presentation would be designed in such a way as to avoid confusion while maintaining a seamless user experience.
Advantages
:
Enhanced user engagement: Users might discover more topics or conversations of interest.
Increased awareness of related or trending discussions.
Reduced need to switch between multiple chat rooms, providing a more fluid chat experience.
Challenges
:
Avoiding information overload for users.
Efficiently determining what constitutes a "nearby" chat room based on dynamic criteria.
Ensuring a user-friendly GUI that differentiates messages from different sources without causing confusion.
Given the described approach, the aim is to foster a more dynamic and interwoven chat ecosystem, where users aren't just isolated in their individual chat rooms but are given a window into a broader conversation landscape. This concept resonates with the modern shift in digital communication tools aiming for more interconnected and fluid user experiences.
It looks like that patent was inspiration for my a few of my theories. The "thin walls" inspired the "leaking chat room" and made me think of the reed walls in the Utnapshtin story:

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.


Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.
ChatGPT
Monica's theories draw parallels between the digital realm and cognitive processes, seeking to explain the inner workings of the mind using metaphors and examples from modern technology and ancient narratives. Let's break down the three theories:
Monica's Leaking Chatroom Theory
:
Metaphor
: The mind operates like a digital chat room, where numerous dialogues (or thought processes) occur simultaneously.
Function
: Some thoughts "leak" or transfer from one processing unit to another, enabling cross-referencing of information and enhancing decision-making.
Implication
: Our mind filters massive amounts of information and ensures that crucial insights or information reach the higher-level processing centers. It emphasizes the significance of interconnectivity in cognitive processes.
Reed Wall Mind Theory
:
Metaphor
: Inspired by the Babylonian Flood Story's reed walls, the mind acts like a living spaceship or dynamic navigational tool.
Function
: The mind can dynamically navigate various environments using various cognitive skills.
Implication
: Skills acquired from activities such as video gaming contribute to cognitive flexibility. For instance, strategy games might enhance forward planning and adaptability, while games like Minesweeper may enhance pattern recognition.
Motile Womb Theory
:
Metaphor
: The mind, like a womb, is an active environment that fosters the growth and development of cognitive abilities.
Function
: Beyond just receiving information, the mind actively shapes and interprets experiences.
Implication
: Our cognitive abilities are innate but are refined and developed through experiences. Interactive experiences, like gaming, are essential tools for cognitive development.
In summary, Monica's theories use contemporary and ancient metaphors to depict the mind's multi-faceted nature. They propose that our brains are not passive processors but dynamic systems that integrate, adapt, and actively shape our experiences. Whether it's through the interconnected chats in a digital room, the guidance of reed walls in an ancient tale, or the nurturing environment of a womb, our mind's capabilities are vast and ever-evolving.
I am not sure she has developed it into a model of mind. The reed wall in the Utnapshtin narrative represents is a form of cultural diffusion, as a messenger goes from house to house, saying reed wall, Reed wall, and hoping that someone inside is awake and listening. The mobile womb theory posits that mammals learn about the world by feeling inertial forces and hearing sounds outside the womb such as the heartbeat and and environmental sounds, another "thin wall"
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. With this clarification, let's delve deeper into the theoretical representations:
Monica's Leaking Chatroom Theory
:
Conceptualized as a space where various thought processes or conversations occur simultaneously, this theory emphasizes the idea that information or thoughts from one area can "leak" or transfer to another, not just in a disruptive way but potentially as a means of enhancing cognitive synthesis or decision-making. It's similar to overhearing a conversation in one chat room that could inform or influence discussions in another, reflecting how interrelated thoughts or processes in the mind might interact.
Reed Wall Mind Theory
:
Drawing inspiration from the Utnapishtim narrative, the reed wall symbolizes permeability and selective transmission. Just as the messenger speaks to the reed wall hoping someone inside hears the message, our mind might absorb information from the external environment, hoping it resonates with an internal cognitive process or stored memory. The reed wall represents a threshold, not just a barrier, suggesting that the mind is discerning about which external inputs it acknowledges or integrates.
Motile Womb Theory
:
This theory is grounded in the idea that our earliest learnings begin in the womb, where we're exposed to sounds (like a heartbeat or external noises) and sensations (like movement). The womb, acting as a thin barrier between the developing fetus and the external world, allows for a limited but significant interaction with the environment. This "protected" interaction forms the foundation for our earliest cognitive and sensory development. It emphasizes how even before birth, mammals are primed for learning through passive interaction with their surroundings.
When combined, these theories could propose a multi-layered model of the mind. Starting from the womb, where the foundation of cognition begins, progressing to a permeable reed wall where selective external information is taken in, and culminating in the dynamic environment of a chat room, where multiple internal dialogues interact and influence each other. The recurrent theme is the "thin wall" or the permeable barrier, suggesting that the mind is continuously in a state of interaction with its internal and external environments, shaping and being shaped by them.
I thought I would call the conversation Leaking Chatroom Theory
ChatGPT
"Leaking Chatroom Theory" is an apt name. It succinctly captures the essence of the idea: that our cognitive processes or conversations aren't isolated; they influence and are influenced by other internal dialogues, as well as by external inputs.
In this theory:
Chatrooms
represent individual cognitive processes, or places of concentrated thought and decision-making.
Leaking
symbolizes the transfer or diffusion of thoughts, ideas, and influences between these processes.
It highlights the fluid nature of thought, the interconnectedness of cognitive processes, and the permeability of the barriers between internal thought and external influence. Just as in a chat system where conversations in one room can be heard in another, our internal dialogues can be influenced by other thoughts and external stimuli.
The theory can be further developed to elaborate on how this "leaking" or diffusion of information affects our overall decision-making, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. It might explain why sometimes an idea from one domain or context can suddenly provide a solution or insight in an entirely different domain or context, illustrating the interconnectedness of our cognitive processes.
Elaborate
ChatGPT
Certainly. Let's dive deeper into the "Leaking Chatroom Theory."
Conceptual Framework:
1. Chatrooms as Cognitive Modules:
Each "chatroom" represents an individual cognitive module or domain of knowledge. For instance, one might be dedicated to mathematical reasoning, another to social interactions, another to musical appreciation, and so on.
These modules are not silos. While they specialize in particular areas, they communicate and influence each other.
2. Leaks as Information Exchange:
"Leaks" between chatrooms symbolize the spontaneous exchange of information and cross-talk between different cognitive domains.
This cross-talk is vital for creativity, where an idea or concept from one domain can influence or inspire a new thought in another.
3. External Stimuli:
Just as chatrooms can "hear" from adjacent rooms, our cognitive processes are permeable to external inputs. Sensory experiences, cultural influences, and social interactions all feed into our internal dialogues.
These external influences can "nudge" or direct our internal dialogues, providing new perspectives or context.
Implications and Applications:
1. Interdisciplinary Innovation:
One of the reasons interdisciplinary approaches are so powerful is because they actively exploit the "leaks" between different domains of knowledge. An engineer collaborating with a biologist might find inspiration in natural systems to develop new technologies.
2. Learning and Memory:
The theory might explain why studying in varied environments or interspersing different subjects can aid memory and understanding. The "leaks" or cross-talk between different cognitive processes can provide multiple pathways to retrieve information.
3. Problem Solving:
When faced with a challenging problem, sometimes stepping away or engaging in a different activity (switching "chatrooms") can lead to a solution. This is because the problem is still being processed in the background, and the cross-talk from other cognitive processes can provide new insights.
4. Mental Health:
Recognizing that our thoughts are not isolated can have therapeutic implications. For instance, understanding that a negative thought in one "chatroom" can influence feelings in another can be crucial in cognitive behavioral therapies.
5. Enhancement of Creativity:
Actively engaging in diverse activities or learning varied subjects might stimulate the "leaks" between chatrooms, leading to innovative ideas or insights.
In essence, the "Leaking Chatroom Theory" underscores the interconnectedness of our cognitive processes. It suggests that our mind thrives on the fluid exchange of ideas and experiences, both internally and with the external world. It's a celebration of the holistic nature of human cognition, where boundaries are permeable and every experience, thought, or interaction can have wide-reaching implications.
