The natural numbers can be defined as an inductive type. This definition is based on the Peano axioms and states that every natural number is either zero or the successor of some other natural number.

inductive nat : Type
| zero : nat
| succ : nat → nat
Addition of natural numbers can be defined recursively, using pattern matching.

definition add : nat → nat → nat
| n zero     := n
| n (succ m) := succ (add n m)
This is a simple proof in lean in term mode.

theorem and_swap : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
    assume h1 : p ∧ q,
    ⟨h1.right, h1.left⟩
This same proof can be accomplished using tactics.

theorem and_swap (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
begin
    assume h : (p ∧ q), -- assume p ∧ q is true
    cases h, -- extract the individual propositions from the conjunction
    split, -- split the goal conjunction into two cases: prove p and prove q separately
    repeat { assumption }
end

The first document describes the natural numbers as an inductive type based on the Peano axioms, which states that every natural number is either zero or the successor of some other natural number. It also shows how addition of natural numbers can be defined recursively using pattern matching.
The second document provides an example of a simple proof in Lean using term mode, demonstrating how the "and_swap" theorem can be proven by assuming "p and q" is true, and then swapping the propositions to prove "q and p". The same proof is then shown using tactics, where the goal conjunction is split into two cases (proving "p" and "q" separately) and the "assumption" tactic is used to complete the proof.

Could you give some basic examples of how to write programs in lean?
1 / 1
Sure, here are some basic examples of how to write programs in Lean:
Defining a function to add two natural numbers:
arduino
Copy code
def
add
(m n : ℕ)
: ℕ :=
m + n
This function takes two natural numbers
m
and
n
as input and returns their sum, which is also a natural number.
Defining a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a natural number:
go
Copy code
def factorial : ℕ → ℕ
|
0
:=
1
| (n +
1
) := (n +
1
) * factorial n
This function takes a natural number
n
as input and returns the product of all natural numbers from 1 to
n
, which is also known as
n!
. The function is defined recursively using pattern matching, with the base case being
0! = 1
and the recursive case being
n! = n * (n - 1) * ... * 2 * 1
.
Defining a data type to represent a binary tree:
arduino
Copy code
inductive
tree
(α : Type)
: Type
| empty {
} : tree
| node     : α → tree → tree → tree
This data type represents a binary tree, which is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children. The
tree
type is parameterized by a type
α
, which represents the type of data stored in the tree. The
empty
constructor represents an empty tree, while the
node
constructor represents a non-empty tree with a value of type
α
, a left subtree, and a right subtree.
These are just a few basic examples of how to write programs in Lean. The language is quite expressive and powerful, and can be used to define complex data structures and algorithms.

What about general purpose programming in lean?
1 / 1
Yes, Lean is a general-purpose programming language that supports a wide range of programming paradigms, including functional programming, imperative programming, and object-oriented programming. Here are some examples of how Lean can be used for general-purpose programming:
Functional programming: Lean supports functional programming with features such as higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and pattern matching. Here's an example of a function that applies a given function to all elements of a list:
go
Copy code
def
map
{α β : Type} (f : α → β) : list α → list β
| []      := []
| (x::xs) := f x ::
map
xs
This function takes a function
f
that maps elements of type
α
to elements of type
β
, and a list of elements of type
α
, and returns a new list of elements of type
β
, where each element is the result of applying
f
to the corresponding element in the input list.
Imperative programming: Lean also supports imperative programming with features such as mutable variables, loops, and arrays. Here's an example of a program that uses an array to compute the sum of the first
n
natural numbers:
less
Copy code
def
sum_natural_numbers
(
n
: nat) :
nat
:=
let
a
:=
array
.mk_array
(n +
1
)
0
in
for
i
in
list
.range
1
(n +
1
)
do
a
[i]
:=
a
[i - 1]
+
i
,
a
[n]
This program creates an array of size
n + 1
initialized to all zeros, and then uses a loop to compute the sum of the first
n
natural numbers by updating each element of the array with the cumulative sum up to that index.
Object-oriented programming: While Lean is primarily a functional programming language, it also supports object-oriented programming with features such as classes, methods, and inheritance. Here's an example of a class that represents a rectangle and computes its area:
arduino
Copy code
class
rectangle
(width height : ℕ)
:=
(area : ℕ := width * height)

def my_rect := rectangle.mk
3
4
#eval my_rect.area -- returns 12
This program defines a
rectangle
class with
width
and
height
fields, and an
area
field that is computed as the product of the width and height. It then creates an instance of the
rectangle
class with width 3 and height 4, and computes its area using the
area
field.

What about meta programming in lean?
1 / 1
Meta-programming in Lean refers to the ability to write programs that manipulate other programs or proofs as data. Lean's powerful type system and dependent types allow for powerful meta-programming techniques. Here are some examples of meta-programming in Lean:
The
quote
function: The
quote
function takes a term or proposition and returns a syntax tree representing that term or proposition. This syntax tree can be manipulated using other functions in the Lean API to perform transformations on the code. For example:
less
Copy code
def
add_commutes
(a
b
: ℕ) :
a
+
b
=
b
+
a
:=
eq
.refl
(a + b)
#check
(quote add_commutes)
The
quote
function returns a syntax tree representing the
add_commutes
function, which can be inspected or manipulated programmatically.
The
eval
function: The
eval
function takes a syntax tree representing a term or proposition and evaluates it. This can be used to dynamically generate and evaluate code at runtime. For example:
bash
Copy code
def evaluate_add (a b : ℕ) : ℕ :=
let
expr
:= quote (a + b)
in
eval
expr
This function takes two natural numbers
a
and
b
, constructs a syntax tree representing the expression
a + b
, and evaluates it using the
eval
function.
The
tactic
monad: The
tactic
monad is used to write custom tactics, which are programs that manipulate proofs. Tactics can be used to automate repetitive proof steps or to construct complex proofs. For example:
arduino
Copy code
meta def my_tactic : tactic unit :=
do
intro `H,
    exact H
example
(p q : Prop) : (p → q) → p → q :=
  begin
    my_tactic,
  end
This program defines a custom tactic
my_tactic
that takes an assumption
H
and uses it to prove the goal. It then uses the tactic in a proof of the proposition
(p → q) → p → q
.

How would we make visualizations?
1 / 1
In Lean, you can use external libraries like
mathlib
and
tactic.slim_check
to generate visualizations.
mathlib
provides a variety of functions for visualizing mathematical objects like sets, functions, and graphs.
tactic.slim_check
provides a way to visualize counterexamples to a given theorem or proposition.
Here's an example of using
mathlib
to visualize a simple function:
python
Copy code
import
data.
set
.basic
def
f
(x : ℝ) : ℝ := x^
2
+
2
*x +
1
def
graph_f
:
set
(ℝ × ℝ) := { p : ℝ × ℝ | p
.2
= f p
.1
}
#eval graph_f
This program defines a function
f
and a set
graph_f
representing the graph of
f
. The
#eval
command prints the set
graph_f
to the console, which looks like this:
Copy code
{⟨-1, 0⟩, ⟨0, 1⟩, ⟨-2, 1⟩, ⟨1, 4⟩, ⟨-3, 1⟩, ⟨2, 9⟩, ⟨-4, 1⟩, ⟨3, 16⟩, ⟨-5, 1⟩, ⟨4, 25⟩, ⟨-6, 1⟩, ⟨5, 36⟩, ⟨-7, 1⟩, ⟨6, 49⟩, ⟨-8, 1⟩, ⟨7, 64⟩, ⟨-9, 1⟩, ⟨8, 81⟩, ⟨-10, 1⟩, ⟨9, 100⟩}
This set represents the points on the graph of
f
as ordered pairs
(x, y)
.
Here's an example of using
tactic.slim_check
to visualize a counterexample to a proposition:
less
Copy code
import
tactic
.slim_check
example
(a
b
: ℕ) :
a
+
b
≥
a
:=
by
slim_check
This program states a proposition and uses the
slim_check
tactic to search for a counterexample. If a counterexample is found, it will be printed to the console along with a visualization of the counterexample. For example:
markdown
Copy code
counterexample
===================
a := 0
b := 1
===================
This output indicates that the proposition
a + b ≥ a
is false when
a = 0
and
b = 1
, and provides a visualization of these values.

What about visualizing a sine wave?
1 / 1
To visualize a sine wave in Lean, you can use external libraries like
mathlib
and
tactic.slim_check
to generate a set of points representing the sine wave, and then plot these points using a graphing library like
LeanChart
.
Here's an example of how to generate and plot a set of points representing a sine wave:
arduino
Copy code
import
LeanChart
import
data.real.
basic

def
sine_wave_points
(n : ℕ)
: list (ℝ × ℝ) :=
list.
map
(λ x, (x, real.sin x)) (list.range n)
def
sine_wave_chart
(n : ℕ)
: LeanChart :=
LeanChart.mkLineChart $ sine_wave_points n
#eval sine_wave_chart 100
This program defines a function
sine_wave_points
that generates a list of
n
points representing a sine wave, and a function
sine_wave_chart
that converts these points into a
LeanChart
object. The
#eval
command plots the sine wave with
n = 100
points to the console.
You can adjust the value of
n
to change the number of points used to represent the sine wave, which will affect the smoothness and resolution of the plotted wave. You can also adjust the parameters passed to the
LeanChart
constructor to change the appearance and style of the chart.
