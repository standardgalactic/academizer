Locating Swype Dictionary on Android Phone
Get App
I would like try to to find out where the Swype dictionary is stored on my android phone
Edit
The Swype keyboard dictionary (word suggestions and learned words) is typically stored in a database or file within the
Android system directories
. However, the exact location depends on the Swype version and device manufacturer. Here are some common places to look:
1. Internal App Data Directory (Root Required)
Swype stores its dictionary in its private app data folder, usually in:
Copy
Download
/data/data/com.swype.android.inputmethod/databases/
The main dictionary file might be named something like:
swype_dict.db
(SQLite database)
user_dictionary.db
swype.db
You can access this path using:
A
root-enabled file explorer
(e.g., Solid Explorer, Root Explorer)
ADB (Android Debug Bridge) with root access.
2. External Storage (Possibly Without Root)
Some versions may store backup files in:
Copy
Download
/sdcard/Android/data/com.swype.android.inputmethod/files/
or
Copy
Download
/sdcard/Swype/
Look for
.db
,
.xml
, or
.txt
files.
3. Android User Dictionary (Shared Across Keyboards)
Swype may also use the
system user dictionary
, located at:
Copy
Download
/data/data/com.android.providers.userdictionary/databases/user_dict.db
(Requires root to access.)
How to Extract/Backup the Dictionary?
With Root Access:
Use a
SQLite database viewer
(e.g.,
SQLite Browser
) to open
.db
files.
Copy the files to your PC via ADB:
sh
adb pull /data/data/com.swype.android.inputmethod/databases/swype_dict.db
Without Root:
If Swype has a
backup/export
feature, use it.
Try
Helium Backup
(if Swype supports it) to backup app data.
Note:
Swype was discontinued
in 2018, so newer Android versions may not support it.
If you're using a
third-party keyboard
with Swype-like features (like Gboard or SwiftKey), the dictionary location will differ.
Would you like help finding an alternative keyboard or restoring your Swype data? Let me know!
Other keyboards are not as good although I am using SwiftKey on the newest android. I have swype on like three older phones and a tablet and used it for years so there would be a lot of data on how I trained it that I would like to use on other p projects eventually.
Edit
Since Swype is no longer officially supported, extracting and reusing your trained dictionary data requires some effort, but it's possible. Here's how you can
preserve and transfer your Swype dictionary
from your old devices to other projects or even attempt to integrate it into SwiftKey or another keyboard.
Step 1: Locate & Extract the Swype Dictionary Files
Since you have older devices with Swype still installed, you can pull the dictionary files. The most important files are:
swype_dict.db
(or similar) - Contains learned words, predictions, and typing habits.
Typically stored in:
/data/data/com.swype.android.inputmethod/databases/
If you have
root access
, use a
root-enabled file explorer
(e.g., FX File Explorer, Solid Explorer) or
ADB
to copy the file.
user_dictionary.db
- May contain manually added words.
Check both Swype's private folder and the system user dictionary:
/data/data/com.android.providers.userdictionary/databases/user_dict.db
Backup files
(if Swype had an export option)
Some versions stored backups in:
/sdcard/Swype/backup/
Step 2: Convert the Dictionary for Reuse
Swype's dictionary is usually in
SQLite (.db)
format. You can:
Extract words
using an SQLite viewer (e.g.,
DB Browser for SQLite
).
Convert to a text file
(one word per line) for use in other projects.
Example (Using ADB & SQLite3):
Pull the database file:
sh
Copy
Download
adb pull /data/data/com.swype.android.inputmethod/databases/swype_dict.db
Open it in SQLite Browser and export the relevant tables (e.g.,
words
,
user_lexicon
).
Step 3: Import into Another Keyboard (If Possible)
SwiftKey:
SwiftKey allows importing a
custom word list
(
.txt
file) via:
/sdcard/SwiftKey/userLanguageModel.txt
Format: One word per line, optionally with frequency counts (e.g.,
word:100
).
Note:
This won't fully replicate Swype's predictions but helps with autocomplete.
Other Keyboards (Gboard, AnySoftKeyboard):
Some support importing
user dictionaries
via
.txt
or
.csv
.
Custom Projects:
Use the extracted words for
AI text prediction models
,
personal wordlists
, or
keyboard app development
.
Alternative: Emulate Swype's Behavior
If you want to
recreate Swype's glide-typing experience
:
Try OpenBoard (FOSS keyboard)
- Supports gesture typing and custom dictionaries.
Use Texpand (Macro App)
- Auto-replace shortcuts with frequently used phrases.
Final Notes
If your old devices
aren't rooted
, try
Helium Backup
(if Swype is still functional) to backup app data.
If you need help
decoding the
.db
structure
, let me know—I can guide you through SQL queries.
Would you like help automating this process (e.g., writing a script to extract words)? I can provide Python/ADB scripts to simplify it!
I will look around swiftkey has swipe trace but doesn't have the control a x c and v shortcuts which makes it a little inconvenient.
Edit
You're absolutely right—Swype had
amazing one-handed shortcuts
(like
a
for select all,
c
for copy,
x
for cut, and
v
for paste) that made editing text incredibly efficient. Sadly, most modern keyboards (including SwiftKey) lack these, but there are
workarounds and alternatives
to regain some of that functionality.
Option 1: Try a Keyboard That Still Has Swype-Like Shortcuts
1.
Multiling O Keyboard
(Best Alternative)
Why?
It's one of the last keyboards that still supports
Swype-style shortcuts
(including
a, c, x, v
).
How to Set Up:
Install and enable it in
Settings > Language & Input
.
Go to
Settings > Keyboard > Clipboard
and enable
"Use Swype clipboard shortcuts"
.
You may need to manually configure gestures in
Settings > Keyboard > Gestures
.
2.
FlorisBoard (Beta)
(Open-source, but no shortcuts yet)
Doesn't have Swype shortcuts yet, but it's actively developed—might add them in the future.
Option 2: Use Macros or Clipboard Apps to Recreate Shortcuts
If you stick with
SwiftKey
(or another keyboard), you can
partially
restore Swype's shortcuts using:
1.
Clipboard Actions (via Tasker)
Example:
Swipe from
SwiftKey's clipboard key
→ Trigger
Tasker
to paste.
Requires some automation setup.
2.
Texpand (Text Expansion)
Set up
shortcuts
like
;a
→
Select All
,
;c
→
Copy
, etc.
Works globally, but not as seamless as Swype.
3.
Gboard + Clipboard Manager
Gboard has a
clipboard history
feature (long-press → Paste).
Not as fast as Swype, but helps.
Option 3: Extract Swype's APK & Try Side-Loading (If You Still Have Old Devices)
If you have an
old phone/tablet with Swype still installed
, you might be able to:
Extract the APK
using
APK Extractor
.
Install it on a newer device
(may not work on Android 12+ due to compatibility issues).
Use a sandboxed app
like
Shelter
to run old apps safely.
⚠️
Warning:
Swype may crash on modern Android versions, but it's worth a try.
Final Thoughts
Best Short-Term Fix:
Multiling O Keyboard
(supports Swype shortcuts).
Long-Term Solution:
Hope that
FlorisBoard
or
SwiftKey
adds these features (you could request them!).
If You Really Want Swype Back:
Try
extracting the APK
from an old device.
Would you like help extracting Swype from one of your old devices? I can guide you through ADB backup or APK extraction. Let me know!
I manually moved the apk from phone to phone using zapya since I couldn't download it anymore
Edit
Since you've manually transferred the
Swype APK
using
Zapya
, you've already taken the most important step! However, getting Swype fully functional on a newer Android version can be tricky. Here's how to maximize your chances of success:
1. Install the Swype APK on Your New Device
Go to
Settings > Security
and enable
"Install Unknown Apps"
for your file manager.
Open the APK and install it like any other app.
If it
fails to install
, your Android version may be too new. Try:
Using an older Android device
(if available).
Sideloading in compatibility mode
(see below).
2. Force Compatibility Mode (If Swype Crashes)
If Swype installs but
keeps crashing
, try:
A. Use Android's "Compatibility Mode" (If Available)
Go to
Settings > Apps > Swype > Advanced
.
Look for
"Force compatibility mode"
(varies by device).
B. Use a Virtualization App
Shelter
(FOSS) - Runs apps in a work profile, which can help with compatibility.
VMOS
- Runs a virtual Android 5/7 environment where Swype might work.
3. Restore Your Swype Dictionary & Settings
Since you moved the APK but not necessarily the
data
, do this:
A. Extract Data from Old Device (Root Required)
Use
Titanium Backup
or a root file manager to copy:
Copy
Download
/data/data/com.swype.android.inputmethod/
Transfer the folder to the same location on the new device.
B. Manually Import Words into SwiftKey (No Root)
If you can extract
swype_dict.db
, convert it to a
.txt
word list.
Place it in:
Copy
Download
/sdcard/SwiftKey/userLanguageModel.txt
SwiftKey will auto-load these words.
4. Alternative: Recreate Swype Shortcuts
If Swype refuses to work, try mimicking its shortcuts:
A. Use
MacroDroid
Set up
volume button combos
(e.g.,
VolDown + C → Copy
).
B. Try
Multiling O Keyboard
Still supports
a, c, x, v
shortcuts like Swype.
5. Last Resort: Run Swype on an Emulator
If nothing works, install an
Android emulator
on a PC (like
BlueStacks
) with an
older Android version (5.0-7.0)
and use Swype there for typing.
Final Tip: Backup Everything!
Use
ADB Backup
to save Swype's APK + data before your old devices die:
sh
Copy
Download
adb backup -f swype_backup.ab com.swype.android.inputmethod
