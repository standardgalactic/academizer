The MYP project is for our 10th graders.
It's to help them with their transition from MYP into Diploma.
It is based on a personal project that they decide that they have interest in that relates
to them.
They'll be doing research and their grades are based off of their planning, the skills
that they developed during this project, and their reflection.
For my personal project, I did a trailer because I wanted to carry out a project with a deep
message behind it, and I thought that making a trailer would make it an easier way so that
the message could reach out to more people.
It's the chaos of the web made elegant and simple.
I got you an interview tomorrow.
I chose the circle because of the moral and ethical message that it has behind it, and
it talks about how the big companies like Google or Facebook use our information without
any kind of supervision.
So May, do you think you behave better or worse when you are being watched?
Better.
Without a doubt.
My personal pride is about creating a marketing agency or business that creates image designs
or logos for other companies or business.
I found by doing this personal project that this is what I want to do in my future.
I decided to do a dress in my personal project because in the future I would like to study
something related with fashion.
First I did the pattern of the dress in a recycled fabric, just in case the measures
were incorrect, and then I did it in the final fabric, and this is the final result.
