Yeah, the world is so small till it ain't I'm building up a world till it bright
I hate it when I call and it's like I don't want to keep you waiting, I hope I never keep you waiting
I think I know it all, but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke
And I just want to ball, maybe dunk, but I've never been tall
I might trip, I never fall, God knows I came close
Don't try this at home, I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in the rush, I been thinking too much
But keep it on the hush, no one need to know just us
That's really all it take
You don't need nothing but today, today, today, today, yeah
The world is so small till it ain't till it ain't till it ain't till it ain't yeah
I'm building up a world till it bright till it bright till it bright till it bright yeah
She hate it when I call, and it's late, and it's late, and it's late
I don't want to keep you waiting
I hope I never keep you waiting
I got a bad attitude, playing till I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak gets cold in my veins
I'm below freezing, snow season made me
They know that I so need my space, don't want to grow old
So I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waste
And the stroke that's just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drunk shapes and lines of the world
Made yet, tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gonna be worth it if I make it
Made yet, somewhere above you keep reaching up
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothing but today, today, today, today
The world is so small, till it ain't till it ain't till it ain't till it ain't yeah
I'm building up a wall, and till it bright till it bright till it bright till it bright yeah
She hate it when I call, and it's late, and it's late, and it's late
I don't want to keep you waiting
I hope I never keep you waiting
Waiting
Nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
Tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slipping
In a motherfucking instant I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre
Staring at the wall in a wall full of posters
Looking in my dreams, who I want to be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Who I've been a fool, but it's cold
That's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glow to your shoes
I guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun coming out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
When it blows, when it blows
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'
Thank you, guys
That's a...
Stundercat on the shaker
Beautiful job, bro
It's beautiful
I think I'm supposed to talk in between, but...
I don't know
Let's just like stand here and exchange looks
Alright
Alright, alright, oh yeah, this song is called What's the Use
That was called Small Worlds
Alright, that's enough talking, we're good
Solid, you've heard enough
Alright
Yeah
Yeah
You could love it, you could leave it
Sayin' nothing without it
Yeah, don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it
But there's somethin' bout it
Yeah, and that just freaks me out
Yeah, I just want another minute
With it, fuck a little, what's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it
When it hits you, hit a little
Center, mental when I'm off the juice, yeah
Yeah
Okay, we colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hold up
You don't need a hold up
And I can show you what it seems, what it is
What it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need a hold up
Cause I'm so above and beyond
Take drugs to make it up way up with beyond
Space shuttle, Elon
We don't waste much fuck when we wake up
And I have her saying, just like Celine Dion
Catch me if you can, but you never catch me, damn
Whole lotta yes, I am
All the way in with no exit plan
Already left in the jet, don't land
Yeah, this time it's tickin'
Come take a ride, get inside, this is highly different
I'm talkin' fly, I got a pilot with him, yeah
Can't not mind my business
Why you trippin', give me somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you're doin' the most
You could love it, you could leave it
And singin' nothing without it, yeah
Don't let them keep you down
What if, I don't need it
There's somethin' about it
And that just freaks me out, yeah
I just want another minute with it
Fuck a little, what's the use, yeah
What's the use, yeah
Never superficial, you gon' know it
When it hit you, get a little center
Men don't win, I'm off the juice, yeah
Well, let me give you what you came for
You know, quick to all that I've got to do
Who you are, sippin' costs so far
But boy, we could parlay all day
Crippin' long range with the yard
I know I should probably brain more, but you gotta love me
Cause I say that they spend money
When I had nothin' shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies, nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my nose
They throwin' dirt on my name
Won't they never worry my friend
Hats turnin' like a hurricane
Swervin' till the sun get about in my shade
They don't get the picture, cuttin' out of that frame
Shit, I'm up 30 down, my mouth's changed
It's been a while, but I'm down till I'm out
And it is what it is, till it ain't
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I just wanna fly
Thank you
Yeah, you could love it, you could leave it
Singin' nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it
Suckin' about it
That just freaks me out, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want another minute
Waitin' for a little, what's the use, yeah
What's the use, yeah
Never superficial, you gon' learn
When it hit you, get a little center
Man, I win, I'm off the juice, yeah
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, that's it
Make a little bit more noise for Thundercat one time
Yeah
Make a little more noise for Mac
Yeah
Yeah
How's your day? How we doin'? We doin' good?
That's good, that's nice
I'm good, solid, wherever that came from
I'm doin' really solid
I'm doin' really solid
Yeah
Alright, banter, banter, banter
I really wanted to have strings for this song
because this one just means a lot to me off the album
and we weren't gonna be able to travel with strings
so we sent these guys sheet music
and this is actually our first time
we just played it together for the first time
like 20 minutes ago, so thank you guys
It's a beautiful thing, man
Music is a beautiful thing
Alright
Music is a beautiful thing
It's a beautiful thing, baby
It's a beautiful thing
Let me tell you something about music
It's beautiful
Oh, God
Alright, let's do it
Music
Music
Yeah
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
Cause her angel's supposed to fly
I ain't ask her why no more
You know I take it if it's mine
Now stay inside the line
So they 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Okay, you gotta jump in to swim
The light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy
Took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beaming
My whole team bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes
I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of having demons that's as big as my house
Have a ball with it dribbling and bouncing
Cause the party ain't over till they kickin' me out
Isn't it funny we can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yay high money
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
Cause her angel's supposed to fly
I ain't askin' why no more
I know I take it if it's mine
Now I stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
I know what's behind that door
Okay they ask me when I'm smilein' for
Because I never felt this high before
It's like I never been alive before
I'd rather have me peace of mind
Now you see me and you
Ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Takes time to finish
Mind my business
A life ain't a life till you live it
I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Way to the world I gotta carry my own
My own with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you're scared and alone
And you'll never gotta worry
I ain't never been a hurry
Even when it's 7.30 in the time it's runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryin' to stop believing in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound near long
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
And she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
Cause the angel's supposed to fly
I ain't askin' why no more
I know I take it if it's mine
Now I stay inside the lines
In 2009 no more
Yeah I know what's behind that door
Okay I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine
Take a breath and ease my mind
And she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high
Cause the angel's supposed to fly
And I ain't askin' why no more
I know I take it if it's mine
Now I stay inside the lines
In 2009 no more
Yeah I know what's behind that door
Thank you guys, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
