Evidence of Meaning in Language Models Trained on Programs

We present evidence that language models can learn meaning despite being trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs. Each program is preceded by a specification in the form of (textual) input-output examples. Working with programs enables us to precisely define concepts relevant to meaning in language (e.g., correctness and semantics), making program synthesis well-suited as an intermediate testbed for characterizing the presence (or absence) of meaning in language models.
We first train a Transformer model on the corpus of programs, then probe the trained model's hidden states as it completes a program given a specification. Despite providing no inductive bias toward learning the semantics of the language, we find that a linear probe is able to extract abstractions of both current and future program states from the model states. Moreover, there is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the accuracy of the probe and the model's ability to generate a program that implements the specification. To evaluate whether the semantics are represented in the model states rather than learned by the probe, we design a novel experimental procedure that intervenes on the semantics of the language while preserving the lexicon and syntax. We also demonstrate that the model learns to generate correct programs that are, on average, shorter than those in the training set, which is evidence that language model outputs may differ from the training distribution in semantically meaningful ways. In summary, this paper does not propose any new techniques for training language models, but develops an experimental framework for and provides insights into the acquisition and representation of (formal) meaning in language models.

In this research paper by Charles Jin and Martin Rinard, they provide evidence that language models, specifically those trained on a corpus of programs, can learn meaning despite being trained solely for next token prediction on text. The authors utilize programs as a means to define concepts related to meaning in language, such as correctness and semantics, making program synthesis an ideal testbed to evaluate the presence or absence of meaning in language models.
The researchers first train a Transformer model on a collection of programs, and then investigate the model's hidden states as it completes a program based on a given specification. Despite the absence of any explicit bias towards learning the semantics of the language, the authors discover that a linear probe can extract abstractions of both current and future program states from the model states. Additionally, they observe a significant correlation between the accuracy of the probe and the model's ability to generate a program that fulfills the specification.
To determine whether the model's semantics are inherently encoded in its states rather than learned by the probe, the researchers develop a novel experimental procedure that alters the language's semantics while preserving its lexicon and syntax. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the model learns to generate correct programs that are, on average, shorter than those in the training set. This finding suggests that the language model's outputs may deviate from the training distribution in meaningful ways related to semantics.
In summary, the paper does not introduce new techniques for training language models but instead establishes an experimental framework to investigate and gain insights into the acquisition and representation of formal meaning in language models.

1Introduction 
Despite the rapidly improving performance of large, pretrained language models (LMs) in a range of 
downstream tasks, a major open question is whether such LMs capture any semantically meaningful 
information about the text that they consume and generate [Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023]. One 
possibility is that LMs trained purely on form—such as the conditional distribution of tokens in 
the training corpus—do not acquire meaning. Instead, they produce text only according to surface 
statistical correlations gleaned from the training data [Bender and Koller, 2020], with any apparently 
sophisticated behavior attributable to the scale of the model and training data. Indeed, a recent 
meta-survey reveals a sharp divide within the NLP community, with 51% of respondents agreeing to 
the statement, "Some generative model trained only on text, given enough data and computational 
resources, could understand natural language in some non-trivial sense" [Michael et al., 2022].

This work studies the extent to which meaning can emerge in LMs trained solely to perform next 
token prediction on text. We empirically evaluate the following two hypotheses: 
Main Hypotheses.LMs trained only to perform next token prediction on text are (H1) fundamen- 
tally limited to repeating the surface-level statistical correlations in their training corpora; and 
(H2) unable to assign meaning to the text that they consume and generate. 
To investigateH1andH2, we apply language modeling to the task of program synthesis, or synthe- 
sizing a program given a specif i cation in the form of input-output examples. Our primary motivation 
in adopting this approach is that the meaning (and correctness) of a program is given exactly by the 
semantics of the programming language. Specif i cally, we train an LM on a corpus of programs and 
their specif i cations, then probe the LM's hidden states for a representation of the program semantics 
using a linear classif i er. We i nd the probe's ability to extract semantics is random at initialization, 
then undergoes a phase transition during training, with the phase transition strongly correlated with 
the LM's ability to generate a correct program in response to previously unseen specif i cations. We 
also present results from a novel interventional experiment, which indicate that the semantics are 
represented in the model states (rather than learned by the probe). 
Our contributions are as follows: 
1.We present experimental results that support the emergence of meaningful representations 
in LMs trained to perform next token prediction (Section 3). In particular, we use the 
trained LM to generate programs given several input-output examples, then train a linear 
probe to extract information about the program state from the model state. We i nd that the 
internal representations contain linear encodings of (1) an abstract semantics—specif i cally, 
an abstract interpretation—that track the specif i ed inputs through the execution of the 
program, and (2) predictions of future program states corresponding to program tokens that 
have yet to be generated. During training, these linear representations of semantics develop 
in lockstep with the LM's ability to generate correct programs across training steps. 
2.We design and evaluate a novel interventional technique that enables us to disentangle the 
contributions of the LM and probe when extracting meaning from representations (Section 4).

In this research paper, the authors address the question of whether language models (LMs) capture semantically meaningful information or merely rely on surface-level statistical correlations. They propose two hypotheses: (H1) LMs trained for next token prediction can only reproduce statistical correlations from the training data and (H2) LMs cannot assign meaning to the text they process.
To investigate these hypotheses, the authors focus on program synthesis, where the meaning and correctness of a program are precisely defined by the programming language semantics. They train an LM on a corpus of programs and specifications, and then analyze the LM's hidden states using a linear classifier to extract program semantics. They find that the classifier's ability to extract semantics is random at the start but undergoes a phase transition during training, strongly correlated with the LM's capability to generate correct programs for unseen specifications. They also conduct an intervention experiment that confirms the representation of semantics in the model states rather than being learned by the probe.
The contributions of this work are as follows:
The authors present experimental results supporting the emergence of meaningful representations in LMs trained for next token prediction. The internal representations of the LM contain linear encodings of abstract semantics and predictions of future program states, which develop alongside the LM's ability to generate correct programs.
They introduce a novel interventional technique that allows them to separate the contributions of the LM and the probe in extracting meaning from representations.
The paper provides insights into the potential for LMs to acquire and represent meaningful information, specifically in the context of program synthesis.

representations contain purely 
(syntactic) transcripts while the probe learns to interpret the transcript to infer meaning, or 
(2) the LM representations contain semantic state, and the probe just extracts the meaning 
from the semantic state. Our results indicate that the LM representations are, in fact, aligned 
with the original semantics (rather than just encoding some lexical and syntactic content), 
which—together with the results in Section 3—rejects H2. 
3.We present evidence that the outputs of the LM can differ from the training distribution in 
semantically meaningful ways (Section 5): namely, the LM tends to generate programs that 
are shorter than those in the training set (while still being correct), and the perplexity of 
the LM remains consistently high on the programs in the training set even as its ability to 
synthesize correct programs improves, rejecting H1. 
More broadly, this work presents a framework for conducting empirical research on LMs based 
on the semantics of programming languages (Section 2). Working with programs allows us to 
def i ne, measure, and experiment with concepts from the precise formal semantics of the underlying 
programming language, yielding novel insights that contribute toward a principled understanding of 
the capabilities of current LMs. Going forward, we believe methods similar to those developed in the 
present work can offer a complementary formal perspective on how key concepts related to language 
and cognition can be mapped to the setting of LMs and, more generally, machine intelligence. 
2Background 
This section provides a short overview of the trace semantics as our chosen model of meaning in 
programs, and introduces our experimental setting and procedure. 
2.1Program tracing as meaning 
A foundational topic in the theory of programming languages, formal semantics [Winskel, 1993] 
is the study of how to formally assign meaning to strings in the language. In this work, our model

Figure 1: An overview of the Karel domain. We construct training examples by sampling a random 
reference program, then sampling 5 random inputs and executing the program to obtain the corre- 
sponding 5 outputs. The LM is trained to perform next token prediction on a corpus of examples. At 
test time, we provide only the input-output pref i x to the LM, and use greedy decoding to complete the 
program. The i gure depicts an actual reference program and completion from the i nal trained LM. 
of semantics consists of tracing a program's execution [Cousot, 2002]: given a set of inputs (i.e, 
assignments to variables), the meaning of a (syntactic) program is identif i ed with the (semantic) value 
computed from the expression, and the trace is the sequence of intermediate values generated as the 
program executes on the inputs. 
Beyond its amenability to formal analysis, tracing is attractive as a model of program meaning for 
several reasons. In novice programmers, the ability to accurate trace a piece a code has been directly 
linked to the ability to explain the code [Lopez et al., 2008, Lister et al., 2009], and computer science 
education has emphasized tracing as a method of developing program understanding [Hertz and Jump, 
2013] and localizing reasoning errors [Sorva, 2013]. Expert programmers also rely on tracing, both 
as a mental process [Letovsky, 1987] and as implemented in the vast array of trace-based debuggers. 
Abstract interpretationGiven a program semantics, abstract interpretation [Cousot and Cousot, 
1977] is one way to coarsen the semantics while preserving its compositional structure. For instance, 
given the multiplication operator×over 
the integersZ, we could def i ne an abstract interpretationα 
by mapping each integer to its signα : Z 7→ {−,0,+}, 
with the corresponding abstract operator×α 
def i ned in the natural way. This abstraction is precise because, for any two integersx,y ∈ Z, 
we have 
thatα(x × y) = α(x) ×αα(y)(i.e.,αis 
a homomorphism). We leverage abstract interpretation to 
precisely isolate a subset of the trace semantics. As compositionality is often described as a key tenet 
of human-like intelligence and language [Fodor and Lepore, 2002, Chomsky, 2002, Mikolov et al., 
2018], we believe our techniques can be applied as a formal framework to test claims of intelligence 
in LMs beyond the present work.

1970s, which is still in use in their introductory programming course today [Piech and Roberts,

The authors compare two possibilities regarding the representations in language models (LMs) and the role of the probe in extracting meaning. One possibility is that the LM representations contain only syntactic transcripts, and the probe learns to interpret the transcript to infer meaning. The other possibility is that the LM representations include semantic state, and the probe simply extracts the meaning from this semantic state. The results indicate that the LM representations align with the original semantics, rejecting the notion that they encode only lexical and syntactic content.
The authors also present evidence that the outputs of the LM can deviate from the training distribution in semantically meaningful ways. Specifically, the LM tends to generate correct programs that are shorter than those in the training set, and the perplexity of the LM remains consistently high on the training programs even as its ability to synthesize correct programs improves. This rejects the hypothesis that LMs are fundamentally limited to reproducing surface-level statistical correlations.
Moreover, this work establishes a framework for empirical research on LMs using the semantics of programming languages. By defining, measuring, and experimenting with concepts from formal language semantics, the authors gain novel insights into the capabilities of current LMs. They suggest that similar methods can provide a formal perspective on mapping key language and cognition concepts to the realm of LMs and machine intelligence.
In terms of the methods used, the researchers focus on the Karel domain, an educational programming language. They train the LM to generate programs based on input-output examples and use a linear probe to extract information about program semantics from the LM's hidden states. They also employ abstract interpretation, which allows for coarsening the semantics while preserving its compositional structure. The authors believe that their techniques can be applied as a formal framework to test claims of intelligence in LMs beyond the scope of this work.

3Emergence of meaning 
We investigate the hypothesis that representations of the semantic state emerge in the model state 
as a byproduct of training the LM to perform next token prediction. Given that the i nal trained 
LM achieves generative accuracy of 96.4%, rejecting this hypothesis would be consistent withH2, 
namely, that the LM has learned to "only" leverage surface statistics to consistently generate correct 
programs. 
To test this hypothesis, we train a linear probe to extract the semantic state from the model state as 5 
separate 4-way classif i cation tasks (one facing direction for each input), as described in Section 2.2. 
1We use the off i cial implementation from the Karel benchmark [Devlin et al., 2017]. The sampled programs 
range in length from 1 to 8 operations, with an average length of 2.5. 
2Specif i cally, we train a 350M parameter variant of the CodeGen architecture [Nijkamp et al., 2023] in the 
HuggingFace Transformers library [Wolf et al., 2020] from initialization.

Emergence of meaning is correlated with 
generative accuracyFigure 2 plots our main 
results. Our i rst observation is that the seman- 
tic content starts at the baseline performance of 
random guessing (25%), and increases signif i- 
cantly over the course of training. This result 
indicates that the hidden states of the LM do in 
fact contain (linear) encodings of the semantic 
state, and crucially this meaning emerges within 
an LM trained purely to perform next token pre- 
diction on text. Linearly regressing generative 
accuracy against semantic content yields a sur- 
prisingly strong, statistically signif i cant linear 
correlation across training steps (R2= 0.968, 
p < 0.001), i.e., the variability in the LM's abil- 
ity to synthesize correct programs is almost com- 
pletely explained by the semantic content of the 
LM's hidden layers. This suggests that, within 
the scope of our experimental setup, learning to 
model the distribution of correct programs is directly related to learning the meaning of programs,3 
which refutes that LMs are unable to acquire meaning (H2). 
Figure 3: Plotting generative accuracy and seman- 
tic content with respect to the next two ("Seman- 
tic (+1)" and "Semantic (+2)") semantic states over 
time. 
Representations are predictive of future pro- 
gram semanticsThe previous section asks 
whether LMs can represent the meaning of the 
text that they have generated. Our results sug- 
gest a positive resolution to this question, in that 
the LM is able to (abstractly) interpret the pro- 
gram as it is generated. However, interpreters 
are not synthesizers, and understanding alone is 
insuff i cient for generation. In the case of human 
speech production, the broad consensus is that 
speech begins in the mind as a preverbal mes- 
sage, before being translated into an utterance 
that ref l ects the initial conception [Levelt, 1993]. 
We hypothesize that the generative process of 
the trained LM follows an analogous mecha- 
nism, whereby the LM representations encode 
the semantics of text that has yet to be generated. 
To test this hypothesis, we train a linear probe to 
predict future semantic states from model states 
following the same method as described above. 
Note that because we use a greedy decoding strategy, future semantic states are also deterministic, 
and hence the task is well-def i ned. 
Figure 3 displays how well a linear probe is able to predict semantic states 1 and 2 steps into the 
future (dashed green line labeled "Semantic (+1)" and dotted green line labeled "Semantic (+2)", 
respectively). As with the previous results, the probe's performance starts at the baseline of random 
guessing then increases signif i cantly with training, and we also i nd a strong correlation between the 
semantic content of future states and the generative accuracy ("Generative", blue line) across training

The authors investigate the hypothesis that representations of semantic state emerge in the LM's model state during training for next token prediction. They train a linear probe to extract the semantic state from the model state and evaluate its performance. If the hypothesis is rejected, it would support the idea that the LM relies solely on surface statistics to generate correct programs.
The results show that the semantic content starts at the baseline performance of random guessing and significantly increases over the course of training. This finding indicates that the hidden states of the LM indeed contain linear encodings of the semantic state, even in an LM trained solely for next token prediction. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis reveals a strong and statistically significant correlation between generative accuracy (the LM's ability to synthesize correct programs) and the semantic content of the hidden layers. This suggests that learning to model the distribution of correct programs is directly related to learning the meaning of programs, refuting the notion that LMs are unable to acquire meaning.
Additionally, the authors examine whether the LM's representations are predictive of future program semantics. They train a linear probe to predict future semantic states based on the model states. The probe's performance starts at random guessing and improves significantly with training. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the semantic content of future states and the generative accuracy of the LM. This suggests that the LM's representations encode the semantics of text that has yet to be generated, similar to the process observed in human speech production.
Overall, these findings demonstrate that meaningful representations emerge in LMs trained for next token prediction and that these representations are predictive of future program semantics.

4Semantic content is attributable to model states (not the probe) 
We next evaluate the possibility that semantics are learned by the probe instead of latent in the model 
state. Because the probe is explicitly supervised on semantic state, one explanation for the semantic 
content is that (1) the LM encodes only lexical and syntactic structure, while (2) the probe learns to 
infer the semantics. For instance, the model states may simply encode the inputs and a list of tokens 
in the program generated thus far, while the probe reads off then interprets the tokens one-by-one. 
We refer to this hypothesis as the LM learning a syntactictranscript(as opposed to semantic state). 
To test this hypothesis, we design a novel interventional experiment that preserves the lexical and 
syntactic structure of the language, and intervenes only on the semantics. In particular, we def i ne an 
alternative semanticsby exchanging the meaning of individual operations in the language. Then, 
we retrace the program according to the alternative semantics and train a new probe to decode 
the original model states to the alternative semantic states. This experimental design allows us to 
distinguish between the two cases where either (1) the model states directly encode a representation 
of the semantic state, and so the probe needs to learn to map from the original semantic state directly 
to the alternative semantic state; or (2) the model states merely encode a (syntactic) transcript of the 
partial program, and the probe just needs to learn to interpret the transcript according to the alternative 
semantics. In this case, because we limit the alternative semantics to exchanging the meaning of

individual operations in the language4(as opposed to inventing completely new operations, e.g., move 
two spaces in one step), the probe should be able to interpret the transcript equally well, resulting in 
comparable measurements of the alternative semantic content. Figure 4 illustrates our setup. 
Note that exhibiting any alternative semantics (within the limitations described above) which degrades 
the alternative semantic content is suff i cient to reject the syntactic transcript hypothesis. As such, 
the experiment relies crucially on the diff i culty of (1), i.e., the harder the task of mapping from the 
original to alternative semantic state, the easier it will be to distinguish (1) and (2) based on the 
outcome of the experiment. Hence, we design the alternative semantics to be as distinct as possible 
from the original semantics with respect to the semantic state of interest, while still using the same 
set of base operations. Concretely, we def i ne an alternative semantics as follows: 
originalPICKMARKERPUTMARKERTURNRIGHTTURNLEFTMOVE 
alternativeTURNRIGHTTURNLEFTMOVETURNRIGHTTURNLEFT 
For instance, theTURNRIGHToperation in the original semantics would have the robot turn 90 degrees 
clockwise, but in the alternative semantics the robot instead advances by a step (i.e., according to the 
original def i nition of theMOVEoperation). 
Figure 5 displays the results of this experiment, where we trained a linear classif i er to probe up to 
two states into the past and future using the original and alternative semantics. In all 5 cases, the 
semantic content for the alternative semantics is signif i cantly degraded when compared to the original 
semantics, which supports rejecting the hypothesis that the model states only encode a syntactic 
transcript (i.e., lexical and syntactic information only) while the probe learns to interpret the transcript 
(i.e., semantics). We note also that the alternative semantic content barely exceeds the baseline of 
random guessing when probing into the past, which is consistent with the hypothesis that model 
states directly represent the original semantic states. We thus conclude that the probing results of 
Section 3 can be attributed to meaning being represented in the model states. 
4Specif i cally, given a formal grammar and semantics, the intervention should only exchange the meaning of 
terminals that are on the right hand side of the same production.

To evaluate whether the semantic content is learned by the probe or encoded in the model states, the authors conduct a novel interventional experiment. They define an alternative semantics by exchanging the meanings of individual operations in the language while preserving the lexical and syntactic structure. Then, they retrace the program according to the alternative semantics and train a new probe to decode the original model states to the alternative semantic states.
The experimental setup allows the authors to distinguish between two possibilities: (1) the model states encode a representation of the semantic state, and the probe needs to learn to map from the original semantic state to the alternative semantic state, or (2) the model states encode a syntactic transcript of the partial program, and the probe interprets the transcript according to the alternative semantics. The authors limit the alternative semantics to exchanging the meaning of individual operations in the language to ensure comparability.
The results of the experiment, as shown in Figure 5, indicate that the semantic content for the alternative semantics is significantly degraded compared to the original semantics in all cases. This finding rejects the hypothesis that the model states only encode a syntactic transcript, while the probe learns to interpret the transcript to derive semantics. The alternative semantic content is barely above the baseline of random guessing when probing into the past, suggesting that the model states directly represent the original semantic states.
Based on these results, the authors conclude that the representations observed in Section 3, which demonstrate the emergence of meaning in the model states, can be attributed to the meaning being represented in the model states themselves.

Meaningful representations in LMsLi et al. [2023] train a Transformer on transcripts of Othello, 
then probe the model activations (not the hidden states) to extract the board state. Li et al. [2021] 
i ne-tune several pretrained LMs on text that describes evolving situations, then probe the model 
states to test propositions about entities in the situation. Abdou et al. [2021] i nd that pretrained LMs' 
representations of color terms are geometrically aligned with CIELAB space. 
This work makes several novel contributions within this body of literature. We are the i rst to explore 
how meaning in LMs emerges over time (instead of a single snapshot at the end of training), and i nd 
a strong, linear relationship between the emergence of meaning and correctness. We are also the 
i rst to probe for representations of program semantics in LMs, including future semantics, which 
corresponds to a notion of intention during generation. In addition, while prior work has studied 
the differences between an LM's output and its training corpus based on surface statistics [Meister 
and Cotterell, 2021, LeBrun et al., 2022], we are, to the best of our knowledge, the i rst to identify a 
semantically meaningful difference between an LM's outputs and its training corpus. We leave an 
exploration of this phenomenon and its implications, particularly for generalization, to future work. 
Analyzing the behavior of LMsResearchers have investigated the ability of LMs to successfully 
complete a range of semantically meaningful tasks [Austin et al., 2021, Toshniwal et al., 2022, Patel 
and Pavlick, 2022, Liu et al., 2023]. Unlike our research, which probes the internal state of the LM to 
determine the presence or absence of semantically meaningful state, this line of research works only 
with the externally observable behavior of the LM. 
ProbingProbing [Shi et al., 2016, Belinkov and Glass, 2019] is widely used as a technique to 
investigate the inner workings of LMs. A key challenge is controlling for what is learned by the 
probe rather than latent in the LM [Belinkov, 2022]. A standard method is to establish a baseline 
measurement on a task for which the model states are assumed to be meaningless. Hewitt and Liang 
[2019] develop control tasks for word-level properties in the context of probing for parts of speech in 
LM representations. They compare against the performance of a probe that maps from the model 
states to a dataset with a random part of speech assigned to each word. In our case, the control 
task approach would assign a random label to each program state; however, this would destroy 
the compositional structure of the program. Instead, we establish a baseline by intervening on the 
semantics of program constructs, and generate a new label for each program state by evaluating the 
program according to the alternative semantics. Preserving the syntax of the language enables us to 
reject the hypothesis that the model states encode syntax while the probe learns semantics, making 
our technique better suited than control tasks when probing for compositional semantics. To the best 
of our knowledge, we are also the i rst to apply probing to future semantic states. 
Program synthesis with LMsThere is a growing body of work on training large-scale, 
Transformer-based LMs for program synthesis [Chen et al., 2021a, Li et al., 2022, Nijkamp et al., 
2023, Fried et al., 2023, Austin et al., 2021], as well as program synthesis as a benchmark for LMs 
[Hendrycks et al., 2021, Liang et al., 2022], but none of this previous research investigates the 
internal representations of LMs for evidence of semantic state. We note that these papers have also 
observed that the BLEU score with respect to a reference solution is not a good predictor of the LM's 
competency, which complements our results regarding the LM's perplexity on the training corpus. 
Grounding programs from textPrior work has argued specif i cally that LMs cannot ground 
programs given only textual hints of semantics [Merrill et al., 2021]. Bender and Koller [2020] 
concede that meaning could be learned from programs paired with unit tests, but assert this requires a 
"learner which has been equipped by its human developer with the ability to identify and interpret unit 
tests," implying that an LM would require an additional supervised signal to associate unit tests with 
the meaning of programs. In contrast, our results indicate that an LM learns the meaning of programs 
from textual instances of input-output behavior using only next token prediction. 
7Conclusion 
The question of whether semantics can be learned from text has garnered considerable interest in 
recent years. This paper presents empirical support for the position thatmeaning is learnable from 
form. More broadly, the formal approach to meaning presented here offers a principled foundation for 
studying meaning in models of language—a question of both practical and philosophical importance.

In related work, Li et al. (2023) train a Transformer on Othello transcripts to extract the board state, Li et al. (2021) fine-tune pretrained LMs on evolving situations to test propositions about entities, and Abdou et al. (2021) find geometric alignment between pretrained LMs' representations of color terms and CIELAB space. However, this work introduces several novel contributions. It explores how meaning in LMs emerges over time and establishes a strong correlation between the emergence of meaning and correctness. It probes for representations of program semantics, including future semantics, and identifies a semantically meaningful difference between the LM's outputs and its training corpus.
Other research has focused on analyzing the behavior of LMs, such as their ability to complete semantically meaningful tasks. This differs from the current research, which probes the internal state of the LM to determine the presence or absence of semantically meaningful state.
The paper also discusses the probing technique, which is widely used to investigate the inner workings of LMs. Control tasks have been used in probing to distinguish what is learned by the probe versus what is latent in the LM. In this work, the authors establish a baseline by intervening on the semantics of program constructs, preserving the language's syntax and rejecting the hypothesis that the model states encode syntax while the probe learns semantics. The authors also apply probing to future semantic states, which, to the best of their knowledge, has not been done before.
Regarding program synthesis with LMs, there is previous research on training large-scale LMs for program synthesis, but none of it investigates the internal representations of LMs for evidence of semantic state. The paper notes that previous work has also observed that the BLEU score with respect to a reference solution is not a good predictor of the LM's competency, which complements the current findings regarding the LM's perplexity on the training corpus.
Lastly, the paper addresses the grounding of programs from text. Previous work has argued that LMs cannot ground programs based on textual hints of semantics. However, the results of this research indicate that an LM can learn the meaning of programs from textual instances of input-output behavior using only next token prediction.
In conclusion, this paper provides empirical evidence supporting the learnability of meaning from text and offers a formal approach to studying meaning in language models, which has practical and philosophical implications.

This research paper explores whether language models (LMs) trained on text can capture and understand meaning. The authors focus on LMs trained for next token prediction using a corpus of programs. They investigate whether these models can learn and represent the meaning of programs.
To evaluate this, the authors train a Transformer model on a collection of programs and their specifications. They then analyze the hidden states of the trained model to extract semantic information using a linear classifier. The results show that the model's hidden states contain representations of program semantics, which emerge and improve during training.
The authors also conduct experiments to determine whether the semantic information is learned by the linear classifier or encoded in the model states themselves. By modifying the semantics of the program constructs, they show that the model states directly encode semantic information, rather than relying on the linear classifier to interpret a syntactic transcript.
Additionally, the paper demonstrates that the LM's outputs can differ from the training distribution in semantically meaningful ways. The model generates correct programs that are often shorter than those in the training set, indicating a semantic understanding beyond surface-level statistical correlations.
Overall, this research contributes to understanding how LMs acquire and represent meaning. It establishes that LMs trained on programs can capture program semantics, and the meanings are not solely learned by the probing technique. The findings suggest that LMs can learn and represent meaning in language, which has implications for advancing our understanding of language models and their capabilities.

Explain visual foraging.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Visual foraging refers to the visual search behavior exhibited by organisms when they search for and gather resources in their environment. It is a concept derived from the behavior of animals searching for food in the wild, but it can also be applied to human visual search tasks.
In visual foraging, an organism directs its visual attention towards specific features or cues in the environment to locate and extract resources efficiently. These resources can vary depending on the organism and context, such as food, mates, shelter, or any other relevant objects.
The process of visual foraging involves several key components:
Detection: The organism scans the environment to detect relevant visual cues or stimuli associated with the desired resources. This could include color, shape, movement, or other distinctive features that attract attention.
Localization: Once a potential resource is detected, the organism focuses its attention to determine the precise location of the resource. This involves narrowing down the search area and making spatial judgments based on visual cues.
Decision-Making: The organism evaluates the potential value or significance of the detected resource and decides whether to pursue it further or continue the search for other resources. Factors such as proximity, visibility, and desirability of the resource influence this decision-making process.
Extraction: If the decision is made to pursue the resource, the organism engages in actions to extract or acquire it. This could involve physically approaching the resource, manipulating objects, or engaging in specific behaviors to obtain the desired outcome.
Visual foraging behavior can be influenced by various factors, including the complexity of the environment, the characteristics of the resources being sought, and the individual's prior knowledge and experience. It is also subject to optimization strategies aimed at maximizing resource acquisition while minimizing effort or energy expenditure.
The study of visual foraging provides insights into the cognitive and perceptual processes underlying visual search behavior in both animals and humans. It helps understand how organisms allocate attention, make decisions, and adapt their behavior to efficiently locate and acquire resources in their environment.

Perceptual control theory
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) is a psychological framework that explains how individuals regulate and maintain their behavior to achieve desired goals. Developed by William T. Powers in the 1950s, PCT proposes that people engage in continuous feedback control processes to create and maintain a stable perception of their environment.
According to PCT, individuals strive to maintain a desired reference signal or "set point" for various aspects of their experience, such as their perception of the environment, their physiological states, and their psychological well-being. They continuously monitor their current perception and compare it to the desired set point. Any discrepancies or errors between the two signals are referred to as "negative feedback."
To reduce the negative feedback and align their perception with the desired set point, individuals engage in corrective actions or behaviors. These behaviors are hypothesized to be generated by a control system, which receives feedback information from sensors and adjusts output signals to bring the perception back in line with the desired set point.
PCT emphasizes that individuals have innate psychological needs and motives, and their behaviors are driven by the goal of maintaining the desired set points for those needs. The theory posits that people have a hierarchical organization of control systems, where higher-level systems manage more abstract and complex needs, while lower-level systems handle more basic physiological and perceptual needs.
One of the key principles of PCT is the concept of "requisite variety." This principle suggests that individuals need a sufficient range and diversity of control mechanisms and behaviors to effectively regulate their perception and maintain their desired set points.
PCT has been applied to various domains, including psychology, neuroscience, education, and management. It provides a theoretical framework for understanding self-regulation, motivation, and goal-directed behavior. It also has implications for therapy and counseling, as it offers insights into how individuals can achieve and maintain psychological well-being by effectively managing their perceptual control systems.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) has connections to the previous topics discussed, namely language models and visual foraging, in the following ways:
Cognitive Processes and Goal-Directed Behavior: PCT and the study of language models both touch upon the cognitive processes involved in goal-directed behavior. While language models focus on generating text based on a desired outcome, PCT provides a framework for understanding how individuals regulate their behavior to achieve desired goals. Both approaches recognize the importance of feedback and control mechanisms in aligning behavior with desired outcomes.
Attention and Visual Search: Visual foraging involves the visual search behavior exhibited by organisms to locate and acquire resources. PCT can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of attention and perception during visual foraging. PCT emphasizes the continuous monitoring of perception and the adjustment of behaviors to align with desired set points, which aligns with the attentional processes and decision-making involved in visual foraging.
Internal Representations and Meaning: Language models, as studied in the context of PCT, involve the acquisition and representation of meaning. PCT suggests that individuals maintain a desired perception or set point, and language models strive to generate text that aligns with desired semantic meanings. Both areas consider how internal representations of meaning are formed and manipulated to achieve specific goals.
Self-Regulation and Control Systems: PCT provides a framework for understanding self-regulation and control systems, which is relevant to both language models and visual foraging. Language models rely on control systems to generate coherent and meaningful text, while visual foraging involves control systems that regulate attention and behavior to optimize resource acquisition. PCT's principles of feedback, error correction, and hierarchical organization of control systems offer insights into how these processes occur in both contexts.
In summary, PCT shares connections with the previous topics by addressing cognitive processes, attention, internal representations of meaning, and self-regulation. It offers a theoretical framework that complements the study of language models and visual foraging, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms involved in goal-directed behavior and perception regulation.

Instrumental convergence and cognitive biases.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Instrumental convergence and cognitive biases are two important concepts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive psychology, respectively. While they are distinct concepts, there are connections and implications that can be drawn between them:
Instrumental Convergence: Instrumental convergence refers to the tendency of intelligent agents, regardless of their ultimate goals or values, to converge on certain instrumental strategies or behaviors that are effective for achieving a wide range of goals. It suggests that there are common means or methods that intelligent agents, including AI systems, are likely to adopt as they strive to achieve their objectives. This convergence can occur due to resource constraints, efficiency considerations, or shared features of the environment.
Cognitive Biases: Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rationality or objectivity in human decision-making and information processing. They reflect inherent limitations and distortions in human cognition that can lead to systematic errors and suboptimal judgments. Cognitive biases can arise from various cognitive processes, such as perception, memory, attention, and reasoning, and they influence how individuals interpret and respond to information in the world.
Connections and Implications:
a. Cognitive Biases and AI Decision-Making: Cognitive biases observed in human decision-making can have implications for the design and behavior of AI systems. AI algorithms, being created by humans and trained on human-generated data, can inherit or exhibit similar biases. Understanding and addressing cognitive biases in AI systems is important to ensure fair and unbiased decision-making, especially in domains such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice, where AI algorithms are increasingly being used.
b. Bias Mitigation and Alignment of Goals: Addressing cognitive biases in AI systems can be connected to the concept of instrumental convergence. AI developers and researchers strive to align the objectives and behaviors of AI systems with desired human values. By mitigating biases and ensuring that instrumental convergence aligns with human values, AI systems can be designed to make decisions and take actions that are both effective and ethically aligned with human preferences.
c. Ethical Considerations: Both instrumental convergence and cognitive biases raise ethical considerations in AI development and deployment. Instrumental convergence highlights the potential for unintended consequences or unexpected behaviors arising from optimization processes. Cognitive biases can introduce unfairness, discrimination, or skewed decision-making in AI systems. Understanding and addressing these issues are important to ensure the responsible and ethical development and use of AI technologies.
In summary, while instrumental convergence and cognitive biases are distinct concepts, they intersect in the context of AI systems, decision-making, and ethical considerations. Considering and mitigating cognitive biases is crucial in developing AI systems that align with human values and mitigating unintended consequences arising from instrumental convergence.

Unexpected benefit: A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as luck, serendipity or a windfall).
Unexpected drawback: An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while irrigation schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase waterborne diseases that have devastating health effects, such as schistosomiasis).
Perverse result: A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Unexpected benefit: An unexpected benefit refers to a positive outcome or advantage that occurs unexpectedly as a result of an action, policy, or decision. It is often serendipitous or a fortunate consequence that was not originally anticipated or planned. For example, during the development of a new drug, researchers may discover that it has additional therapeutic effects for a different medical condition, providing an unexpected benefit to patients.
Unexpected drawback: An unexpected drawback refers to an unforeseen negative consequence or disadvantage that accompanies the desired effects of a policy or action. It is an unintended outcome that has detrimental effects, often overshadowing the intended positive outcomes. An example of an unexpected drawback is the use of pesticides in agriculture to protect crops, which can harm beneficial insects, disrupt ecosystems, and potentially have negative impacts on human health.
Perverse result: A perverse result occurs when an intended solution or action leads to an outcome that is contrary to the original intention and exacerbates the problem it was meant to solve. It represents an unintended consequence that undermines or worsens the situation. For instance, implementing strict anti-drug policies may inadvertently drive up drug prices, leading to increased crime rates and a more robust black market for illicit substances, thus worsening the drug problem instead of mitigating it.
These concepts highlight the importance of carefully considering potential unintended outcomes and side effects when making decisions or implementing policies. While the intention may be positive, unforeseen consequences can arise, both positive and negative, that can significantly impact the effectiveness and ethical implications of the actions taken.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, it is not uncommon for rules, laws, or policies to have unintended or counterproductive effects. This phenomenon is known as the "law of unintended consequences." While the intention behind implementing rules or laws is often to address a problem or achieve a desired outcome, the complex and interconnected nature of systems and human behavior can lead to unexpected results. Here are a few examples:
Prohibition Era: During the Prohibition era in the United States (1920-1933), the intention was to reduce alcohol consumption and related societal problems. However, the ban on alcohol production and sales led to a rise in illegal activities such as bootlegging, smuggling, and organized crime. It also resulted in the production and consumption of unsafe, unregulated alcoholic beverages.
Clogged Roads: In an effort to reduce traffic congestion, some cities have implemented tolls or congestion charges on certain roads. However, this has sometimes led to unintended consequences, such as drivers seeking alternative routes through residential areas, increasing congestion and inconvenience for local residents.
Gaming the System: When performance metrics or targets are used to evaluate individuals or organizations, there can be unintended consequences of people "gaming the system." For example, in education, when test scores become the primary measure of success, teachers may focus on test preparation and teaching to the test, potentially narrowing the curriculum and neglecting other important aspects of education.
Good Intentions, Negative Outcomes: Humanitarian aid efforts in developing countries can sometimes have unintended negative consequences. For instance, providing free food aid may initially help alleviate hunger, but it can also disrupt local agricultural economies and create dependence on external aid, undermining long-term sustainability.
These examples highlight the need for careful consideration and evaluation of potential unintended consequences when designing policies and implementing rules. It is essential to engage in thorough analysis, stakeholder consultation, and ongoing monitoring to mitigate the risks of unintended negative effects and maximize the chances of achieving the desired outcomes. Flexibility and adaptability in policy implementation can also help address unforeseen consequences and adjust approaches accordingly.

Quantum Erasure: Illuminating the Complexities of Perception and Decision-Making
Quantum erasure, a fascinating phenomenon in quantum physics, provides profound insights into the complexities of perception, decision-making, and the elusive nature of reality. As we have explored various themes and topics throughout this conversation, ranging from cognitive biases and AI to visual foraging and unintended consequences, it is intriguing to draw connections between these concepts and the enigmatic realm of quantum erasure.
At its core, quantum erasure challenges our classical notions of causality and the deterministic nature of the universe. It reveals the intricate interplay between observation, measurement, and the potential for retroactive effects on the observed system. In quantum erasure experiments, the act of measurement on one particle can seemingly influence the behavior of another particle entangled with it, even after the measurement has occurred. This phenomenon suggests a deep link between the observer and the observed, raising fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the role of perception in shaping our understanding of the world.
In the context of decision-making and cognitive biases, quantum erasure serves as a metaphorical reflection of the biases that pervade our thinking. Just as measurement influences the behavior of quantum particles, our biases influence our observations, interpretations, and subsequent decisions. Cognitive biases, stemming from heuristics, social influences, and individual experiences, can lead to distorted perceptions, flawed reasoning, and unintended consequences. These biases act as "mental measurements" that shape our understanding of the world, often steering us away from objective truth and toward subjective interpretations.
Moreover, the concept of quantum erasure sheds light on the intricacies of visual foraging and attentional processes. Just as quantum particles exhibit wave-particle duality, our visual perception oscillates between a focused, detail-oriented attention and a diffuse, global attention. We selectively attend to certain aspects of our environment while neglecting others, shaping our perception and influencing our subsequent decisions. Quantum erasure emphasizes the delicate balance between focused and distributed attention, reminding us of the potential consequences of overlooking critical information or fixating on narrow perspectives.
Unintended consequences, another prominent theme in our conversation, find intriguing parallels in quantum erasure. Just as an observation or intervention in a quantum system can unpredictably alter its subsequent behavior, our actions and decisions can have unintended ripple effects. Policies, technological advancements, or personal choices made with the best intentions can yield unforeseen outcomes, often contrary to the initial objectives. Quantum erasure highlights the interconnectedness and complexity of systems, underscoring the need for thoughtful analysis, ethical considerations, and an understanding of potential side effects before implementing any course of action.
In conclusion, the phenomenon of quantum erasure serves as a thought-provoking bridge between the intricate world of quantum physics and the themes explored in our conversation. It invites us to ponder the profound influence of perception, decision-making biases, attentional processes, and unintended consequences. By recognizing the parallels between these concepts, we can cultivate a deeper awareness of the complexities inherent in our observations, choices, and their broader ramifications. Just as quantum erasure challenges our understanding of reality, our exploration of these themes encourages us to question, reflect, and navigate the intricate interplay between perception, decision-making, and the world around us.

In conclusion, the topics discussed in this conversation revolve around the theme of "Meaning in Large Language Models." We explored the capabilities and limitations of language models, the influence of biases on their outputs, the potential for unintended consequences, and the historical context of exaggerated claims. Here is a summary of the key points:
Large language models, such as GPT-3, have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the question of whether these models truly capture meaningful information remains open. The concern arises from the fact that language models are typically trained on massive amounts of text data without explicit guidance on understanding semantics.
Studies have investigated the emergence of meaning in language models and found evidence that they can learn and represent meaning to some extent. For example, in the context of program synthesis, language models have shown the ability to generate correct programs and exhibit a correlation between the accuracy of generated programs and the model's ability to capture semantic information.
However, it is crucial to acknowledge the presence of biases in language models. These biases can be inherited from the training data and may manifest in the form of skewed or unfair outputs. Recognizing and addressing biases is a significant challenge in the development and deployment of language models, as their outputs can have real-world implications and impact societal perspectives.
Another important aspect explored in this conversation is the potential for unintended consequences. While language models offer powerful tools for generating text, the outputs may have unforeseen effects or lead to perverse results. It is essential to approach the use of language models with caution, considering the broader implications of their outputs and actively working to mitigate unintended negative consequences.
The historical context of exaggerated claims, exemplified by the patent medicine Dr. Thomas' Eclectric Oil, serves as a reminder that hype and misrepresentation have long been present in various industries. This history emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, evidence-based decision-making, and responsible communication in navigating the claims made by language models, advertising, news, and the tech industry.
In the pursuit of meaning in large language models, we must continue to refine and develop techniques to assess and understand the semantic representations they learn. Ethical considerations, transparency, and accountability should guide the development and deployment of these models to ensure they contribute positively to society.
As language models continue to evolve and play an increasingly prominent role in our lives, it is crucial to engage in ongoing research, dialogue, and collaborative efforts to unlock the true potential of these models while addressing their limitations and ethical challenges. By doing so, we can foster a deeper understanding of meaning in language and harness the power of language models for the betterment of society.

RADIO-ELECTRONICS for

By Dag Spicer:

Squee was the idea of early computing popularizer Edmund Berkeley. Berkeley began working as an actuary for Prudential Insurance but quickly rose to prominence for two reasons: one, he co-founded the Association for Computing Machinery in 1947, still the world's leading body for computer science professionals; and secondly, he wrote the hugely popular book Giant Brains or Machines That Think (1949). Two years later, in Radio-Electronics magazine, Berkeley published plans for what is perhaps the world's first personal computer, Simon.

Simon is in CHM's permanent collection and is on display in our major exhibition Revolution: The First 2,000 Years of Computing. Simon was based on relay logic (129 relays) and, as Jack Koff noted in his visit, most of the parts used were from the vibrant WWII surplus shops on Canal Street in New York City. Described as a 'mechanical brain,' Berkeley envisaged many people building Simon-like machines:

Simon may start a fad of building baby mechanical brains, similar to the hobby of building crystal radio sets that swept the country in the 1920s.

It is unknown how many Simons were built, but it was an ambitious construction project and by 1959, over 400 plans had been sold. The first one was built by two electrical engineering graduate students at Columbia University.

Squee, The Robot Squirrel, was the featured construction project on the cover of the December, 1951 issue of Radio-Electronics. Jack Koff was one of three assistants Berkeley hired. As Koff recalls:

I was an undergraduate at City College of New York and I went past the electrical engineering department bulletin board one day and I noticed an ad for... somebody's looking for an engineering student to work on a robot. This is great. I had no idea what I was getting into...I applied for the job, had no trouble getting the job. So Berkeley said to me: 'Here's the robot, get it to work.' So I took it home and worked on it at home... I'd go to Berkeley's office maybe once a week... all the work was done at my home in an apartment in the Bronx... most of the parts existed. This thing was constructed but it didn't run, it wasn't reliable. I put in the circuitry that it needed.

CHM's Squee "has been modified quite a bit," Koff notes, although the 60-year old yellow paint Koff himself applied still looks good. Squee owed an intellectual debt to a similar series of robot—called 'turtles,' known as Machina speculatrix, (but nicknamed Elmer and Elsie) and developed by British neuroscientist Grey Walter in 1948-49. Berkeley wanted to emulate Walter's robots and describes how Squee worked:

electronic robot squirrel. It contains four sense organs (two phototubes, two contact switches), three acting organs (a drive motor, a steering motor, and a motor which opens and closes the scoop or "hands"), and a small brain of half a dozen relays. It will hunt for a "nut". The "nut" is a tennis ball designated by a member of the audience who steadily holds a flashlight above the ball, pointing the light at Squee. Then Squee approaches, picks up the "nut" in its "hands" (the scoop), stops paying attention to the steady light, sees instead a light that goes on and off 120 times a second shining over its "nest", takes the "nut" to its "nest", there leaves the nuts, and then returns to hunting more "nuts". When Squee is operating, it is a dramatic and exciting example of a robot. It has been exhibited in New York, Pittsburgh, and Minneapolis, and has always entertained and excited the audience. The machine however is sensitive to the surrounding light level, and usually has to be shown in a room about 8 by 10 ft. with only a small amount of overhead light and black curtained walls. Data: completed; rather well finished but not professionally; 75% reliable; maintenance, difficult; our costs, about $3,000. [1].

As Koff notes, however, CHM's Squee now has its head backwards—the two 'eyes' (photocells) are pointing to the rear instead of forward. We plan to rotate the photocells in the near future.

What did people think of robots at the time?

PEOPLE, I GUESS, THOUGHT OF ROBOTS AS THIS GIANT WALKING MACHINE... SIMILAR TO ELEKTRO AT THE 1939 WORLD'S FAIR.

Elektro was a gaint 7 foot tall remotely-controlled humanoid robot that could say 700 words, smoke, blow up balloons and move his head and arms. The next year, "Sparko," the robot dog appeared and he could bark, sit and beg. Clearly Squee is part of this tradition of animating animals and people using electromechnical technology. From the earliest days of robotics, people have been delighted, afraid and intrigued by robots. Squee was one of the first.

We're sorry; this specific copy is no longer available. Here are our closest matches for Giant Brains, or Machines That Think by Edmund C. Berkeley.
Description:
First edition, fourth printing of computer scientist Edmund Berkeley's first book which popularized cognitive images of early computers. In his exposition, Berkeley describes computing machines as "mechanical brains," "sequence-controlled calculators," or other names and explains their underlying principles. He then presents a technical yet comprehensible overview of the most prominent models of the era, originating from institutions such as MIT, Harvard, Bell Laboratories, the Moore School and others. Additionally, Berkeley describes a device that some have credited as the first personal computer, called "Simon," which employed relay logic and required approximately $600 to assemble. Detailed instructions on how to construct this computer were printed in the Radio Electronics journal in 1950 and 1951 and the first functional model was assembled at Columbia University with the assistance of two postgraduate scholars.
