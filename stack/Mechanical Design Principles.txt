Dissertation presented at Uppsala University to be publicly examined in Geijersalen, Engelska 
parken, Thunbergsv��gen 3P, Uppsala, Wednesday, 3 June 2015 at 10:15 for the degree of Doctor 
of Philosophy. The examination will be conducted in Swedish. Faculty examiner: Professor 
Thomas Kaiserfeld (Lund University, Department of Arts and Cultural Sciences). 
Abstract 
Orrje, J. 2015. Mechanicus. Performing an Early Modern Persona. Uppsala Studies in History 
of Ideas 46. 233 pp. Uppsala: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. ISBN 978-91-554-9246-5. 
This thesis studies mechanics as a means of making men, rather than machines. Drawing on 
Swedish sources from 1700���50, it approaches mechanics as an exercise of a virtuous subject, 
known to his contemporaries as the ���mechanicus���. The mechanicus was a persona, consisting of 
expectations of the performance of mechanics that were part of the social fabric of the early 
modern Swedish state. The aim of this thesis is to understand how mechanical practitioners 
performed in relation to this persona, and how these expectations in turn were changed by actors��� 
performances. 
By studying the mechanicus, I take an interest in historical ways of conceiving of mechanics. 
Previous research on early modern mechanics has tended to relate it to modern phenomena, such 
as engineers, technology and industrialism, and mechanical practitioners have been considered as 
agents of change, who brought traditional societies into modernity. Avoiding such long narra- 
tives, this thesis presents an alternative history. By following mechanical practitioners, who staged 
themselves as relevant to an early modern state, I seek to understand how mechanics was pre- 
sented and justified in a pre-industrial society. 
The thesis is comprised of four studies. First, I discuss how mature mechanical practitioners 
imagined the exercise of mechanics to make a boy into a mechanicus. These exercises would nur- 
ture an ideal man, encompassing a range of the expected virtues of a male subject. Second, I 
study mechanics and geometry at the Swedish Bureau of Mines between 1700 and 1750. I show 
how, from having initially been associated with the building of machines and subterranean con- 
structions, such knowledge formed the basis of a community of mathematical men of metals. 
Third, I analyse the letters exchanged between the mechanical practitioner Christopher Polham- 
mar and the Swedish king Karl XII, showing how royal patronage of mechanics shaped both 
men. Finally, I follow the mechanical practitioner Anders Gabriel Duhre, who first succeeded 
and then failed to present himself as a virtuous mechanicus to the parliament of the Swedish consti- 
tutional monarchy of the 1720s and 1730s. Taken together, these studies show how men imag- 
ined, succeeded and failed life as a mechanicus in early modern Sweden.

The thesis focuses on the concept of the "mechanicus" during the period 1700-1750 in Sweden. The term "mechanicus" is used to denote an individual adept in the field of mechanics. However, rather than focusing on the machines themselves, the study seeks to understand the social and personal implications of being a mechanicus in that period. It explores how mechanical practitioners performed their roles and how societal expectations influenced and were influenced by these performances.
The research highlights that the "mechanicus" was more than a professional role; it was a persona that encompassed societal expectations and virtues. It discusses how this persona was believed to be developed, starting from the nurturing of a boy into becoming a mechanicus.
The thesis comprises four studies. The first study discusses the nurturing process of a boy into a mechanicus. The second study examines the role of mechanics and geometry at the Swedish Bureau of Mines between 1700 and 1750. The third study analyzes the relationship between the mechanical practitioner Christopher Polhammar and the Swedish king Karl XII. The final study examines the journey of a mechanical practitioner, Anders Gabriel Duhre, in his endeavor to present himself as a virtuous mechanicus.
The keywords associated with this thesis indicate the diverse areas that the research touches upon. These include mechanics, performance, virtue, persona, mathematics, education, masculinity, age, economy, cameralism, Sweden, eighteenth century, and intergenerational relationships.

ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES 
1.1 Some Background Philosophy 
The first objective of any engineering design project is the fulfillment of some human need 
or desire. Broadly, engineering may be described as a judicious blend of science and art in 
which natural resources, including energy sources, are transformed into useful products, 
structures, or machines that benefit humankind. Science may be defined as any organized 
body of knowledge. Art may be thought of as a skill or set of skills acquired through a 
combination of study, observation, practice, and experience, or by intuitive capability or 
creative insight. Thus engineers utilize or apply scientific knowledge together with artistic 
capability and experience to produce products or plans for products. 
A team approach is nearly always used in modern industrial practice, enabling engi- 
neers from many disciplines, together with marketing specialists, industrial designers, and 
manufacturing specialists, to integrate their special credentials in a cooperative cross-func- 
tional product design team effort.1Mechanical engineers are almost always included in 
these teams, since mechanical engineers have broad training in principles and concepts re- 
lating to products, machines, and systems that perform mechanical work or convert energy 
into mechanical work. 
One of the most important professional functions of mechanical engineers is mechan- 
ical design, that is, creating new devices or improving existing devices in an attempt to 
provide the ���best,��� or ���optimum��� design consistent with the constraints of time, money, 
and safety, as dictated by the application and the marketplace. Newcomers to mechanical 
1See 1.2. 
design activity, even those with well-developed analytical skills, are often at first frustrated 
to find that most design problems do not have unique solutions; design tasks typically have 
many possible approaches from which an ���optimum��� must be chosen. Experienced de- 
signers, on the other hand, find challenge and excitement in the art of extracting a ���best��� 
choice from among the many potential solutions to a design problem. Transformation of 
the frustrations of a newcomer into the excitement experienced by a successful seasoned 
designer depends upon the adoption of a broadly based design methodology and practice 
in using it. It is the objective of this text to suggest a broadly based design methodology 
and demonstrate its application by adapting it to many different important engineering de- 
sign scenarios. Practice in using it must be supplied by the reader.

Chapter 2 2.1 Role of Failure Prevention Analysis in Mechanical Design 
A primary responsibility of any mechanical designer is to ensure that the proposed design 
will function as intended, safely and reliably, for the prescribed design lifetime and, at the 
same time, compete successfully in the marketplace. Success in designing competitive 
products while averting premature mechanical failures can be consistently achieved only 
by recognizing and evaluating all potential modes of failure that might govern the design 
of a machine and each individual part within the machine. If a designer is to be prepared 
to recognize potential failure modes, he or she must at least be acquainted with the array 
of failure modes actually observed in the fi eld and with the conditions leading to those fail- 
ures. For a designer to be effective in averting failure, he or she must have a good work- 
ing knowledge of analytical and/or empirical techniques for predicting potential failures at 
the design stage, before the machine is built. These predictions must then be transformed 
into selection of a material, determination of a shape, and establishment of the dimensions 
for each part to ensure safe, reliable operation throughout the design lifetime. It is clear 
that failure analysis, prediction, and prevention perspectives form the basis for successful 
design of any machine element or machine. 
2.2 Failure Criteria 
Any change in the size, shape, or material properties of a machine or machine part that ren- 
ders it incapable of performing its intended function must be regarded as a mechanical fail- 
ure. It should be carefully noted that the key concept here is that improper functioning of 
a machine or machine part constitutes failure. Thus, a shear pin that does not separate into 
two or more pieces upon the application of a preselected overload must be regarded as 
having failed as surely as a drive shaft has failed if it does separate into two pieces under 
normal expected operating loads. 
Failure of a machine or machine part to function properly might be brought about by 
any one or a combination of many different responses to loads and environments while in 
service. For example, too much or too little elastic deformation might produce failure. A 
load-carrying member that fractures or a shear pin that does not shear under overload con- 
ditions each would constitute failure. Progression of a crack due to fl uctuating loads or an 
aggressive environment might lead to failure after a period of time if resulting excessive

chanical failure modes that have been observed in various machine parts and machines is

As these terms are used in this text, and as commonly used in engineering practice, 
the failure modes just listed may be defined and described briefly as follows. It should 
be emphasized that these potential failure modes only produce failure when they gener- 
ate a set of circumstances that interferes with the proper functioning of a machine or 
device. 
Force- and/or temperature-induced elastic deformation failure occurs whenever the 
elastic (recoverable) deformation in a machine member, brought about by the imposed 
operational loads or temperatures, becomes great enough to interfere with the ability of the 
machine to satisfactorily perform its intended function. 
Yielding failure occurs when the plastic (unrecoverable) deformation in a ductile 
machine member, brought about by the imposed operational loads or motions, becomes 
great enough to interfere with the ability of the machine to satisfactorily perform its 
intended function. 
Brinnelling failure occurs when the static forces between two curved surfaces in con- 
tact result in local yielding of one or both mating members to produce a permanent surface

In Chapter 2 of "Keystones of Design: Materials Selection and Geometry Determination," the various modes of mechanical failure are discussed. The following list includes the most commonly observed failure modes in machines and machine parts:
Force- and/or temperature-induced elastic deformation
Yielding
Brinnelling
Ductile rupture
Brittle fracture
Fatigue (high-cycle, low-cycle, thermal, surface, impact, corrosion, fretting)
Corrosion (direct chemical attack, galvanic corrosion, pitting corrosion, intergranular corrosion, selective leaching, erosion corrosion, cavitation corrosion, hydrogen damage, biological corrosion, stress corrosion)
Wear (adhesive, abrasive, corrosive, surface fatigue, deformation, impact, fretting)
Impact (fracture, deformation, wear, fretting, fatigue)
Fretting (fatigue, wear, corrosion)
Creep
Thermal relaxation
Stress rupture
Thermal shock
Galling and seizure
Spalling
Radiation damage
Buckling
Creep buckling
Stress corrosion
Corrosion wear
Corrosion fatigue
Combined creep and fatigue
These failure modes occur when certain circumstances interfere with the proper functioning of a machine or device. Each failure mode is briefly described in the text to provide an overview of its characteristics.
For example, force- and/or temperature-induced elastic deformation failure occurs when the elastic deformation in a machine member caused by operational loads or temperatures hinders the machine's ability to perform its intended function. Yielding failure occurs when the plastic deformation in a ductile machine member, due to operational loads or motions, interferes with the machine's function. Brinnelling failure refers to the local yielding of curved surfaces in contact, resulting in permanent surface deformation.
The chapter emphasizes that understanding these failure modes is crucial for preventing failures and ensuring the proper functioning, safety, and reliability of machines and machine parts. By considering and addressing these failure modes during the design stage, engineers can make informed decisions to mitigate potential failures and improve the overall performance of the design.

Back to the other book, the mechanicus... 1. The subject of early modern mechanics 
In 1727, the young mathematician Johan M��rt published a mathematical 
textbook, translated from Latin and adapted for the youth of the Swedish 
state. M��rt���s preface explained that mathematics was not as ���fruitless or 
breadless��� as some claimed it to be. Not only was it a means of disciplining 
reason and imagination, it also provided ���deep and respectful thoughts of 
GOD and his hidden wisdom���. For M��rt, mathematics was useful because 
it led young minds away from ���ignorance���. Mathematical education stimu- 
lated ���sound and pure thoughts��� and made students into ���useful members 
of the public���.1 
To early modern Europeans, mathematics denoted a broad range of 
activities. The term did not only refer to ���pure mathematics���, such as arith- 
metic and geometry: it also included arts that in some way depended on 
numbers and figures (e.g., optics, fortification and geodesy), called ���practical 
mathematics���. This thesis is concerned with one form of practical mathe- 
matics in particular: mechanics. Most histories of early modern mechanics 
have discussed it as a way of building useful machines and understanding 
nature. Both these aspects of mechanics have been linked to long narratives 
of the rise of a scientific worldview, modern technology and industrialism. 
M��rt, however, seems to imply a third, less explored, aspect of early modern 
mechanics, which is not so clearly part of these long narratives. He under- 
stood it as a means of crafting useful and virtuous subjects aligned to a spe- 
cific social and religious order. M��rt was not alone in seeing mechanics as 
an exercise of virtue. On the contrary, early modern authors repeatedly dis- 
cussed mechanics as a useful exercise that fostered a virtuous and pious 
subject. To his contemporaries, this man was known as the ���mechanicus���. 
The mechanicus is an evasive and ephemeral object of study: it consists 
of the expectations that came to being in the encounter between practition- 
ers of mechanics and their contemporaries. As such, it was an ever-changing 
set of ideals and norms, which were both the prerequisite and result of me- 
chanical work. The cases presented in this book draw on Swedish sources.

Friedrich Weidler and Johan M��rt (tran.): En klar och tydelig genstig eller anledning til geometrien och 
trigonometrien (Stockholm, 1727), preface. The Latin original was Johann Friedrich Weidler: Institu- 
tiones mathematicae decem et sex pvrae mixtaeque matheseos disciplinas complexae (Wittenberg, 1718).

The subject of early modern mechanics encompassed more than just building useful machines and understanding nature. It had a broader significance tied to the crafting of useful and virtuous individuals aligned with a specific social and religious order. This perspective on mechanics as an exercise of virtue was shared by many early modern authors, and the practitioners of mechanics who embodied these ideals were known as the "mechanicus."
The mechanicus, as an object of study, represents the expectations and ideals that emerged from the interaction between mechanics practitioners and their contemporaries. It was a constantly evolving set of norms and ideals that shaped and were shaped by the practice of mechanics. This book focuses on Swedish sources to explore the mechanicus and its significance in the context of early modern society.
The mentioned case of Johan M��rt, a mathematician in 1727, highlights the belief that mathematics, including practical mathematics like mechanics, was not only useful for building machines but also for disciplining reason and imagination. It was seen as a way to stimulate deep and respectful thoughts about God and his wisdom, and to cultivate sound and pure thoughts in students, making them useful members of society.
While previous histories of mechanics have often linked it to the rise of a scientific worldview, modern technology, and industrialism, M��rt's perspective introduces a different dimension. It suggests that mechanics served as a means of shaping individuals and aligning them with a specific social and religious order, thus emphasizing its role in crafting virtuous subjects.
Overall, this book explores the multifaceted nature of early modern mechanics and its relationship to virtue, social order, and religious beliefs, shedding light on a lesser-explored aspect of the subject.

In a sense, this makes it a cultural history of the mechanicus in Sweden. 
However, I would argue that my conclusions are broader than the geo- 
graphical delimitation and that similar processes were enacted throughout 
early modern Europe. The mechanicus can be found in narratives of the 
lives and work of men who practised mechanics; it was forged through rela- 
tionships between mechanically interested men; and, as we will see, it was 
related to the political order of the early modern Swedish state. I thus study 
the mechanicus from a number of perspectives, using several methodologies 
and categories of sources. I examine textbooks and speeches filled with 
imagined coming-of-age narratives of mechanics; letters in which young 
men presented themselves to the state administration as competent in 
mathematics and mechanics; correspondence where practitioners of me- 
chanics crafted themselves in relation to the sovereign; and protocols from 
the Swedish parliament and rural courts that discuss matters involving me- 
chanics and mathematics. Through these heterogeneous sources, I study the 
relationships between actors ��� in the Latin sense of ���doers��� ��� and the audi- 
ences who interpreted their actions. I thus take an interest not only in what 
has been written about mechanics, but also for whom it was written and for 
what reasons. 
I examine the processes by which men formed themselves in relation to 
the audiences��� and actors��� expectations that constituted the mechanicus, and 
how these expectations were changed by performances of mechanics. These 
���mechanical practitioners��� (i.e., actors who were, or were trying to be, re- 
cognised as knowledgeable in this field) should not be seen as agents of 
change in opposition to an early modern order, but as men working to meet 
the expectations of their contemporaries. Therefore, the mechanicus should 
be related to the social and natural orders of his time, as well as to religion, 
politics and epistemologies (i.e., frameworks of making and categorising 
knowledge). I thus examine how mechanical exercises shaped and made 
early modern men, asking questions such as: How was the mechanicus a 
part of the early modern Swedish state? How did men present themselves as 
trustworthy and valuable subjects through mathematics and crafts? How did 
they in turn shape the expectations of who a mechanicus was? How can we 
understand mechanical practitioners��� successes, and failures, to meet the 
expectations of contemporary audiences?

The study of the mechanicus in this book goes beyond the geographical delimitation of Sweden and argues that similar processes occurred throughout early modern Europe. The mechanicus can be identified in narratives about the lives and work of mechanics, forged through relationships between individuals interested in mechanics, and connected to the political order of the early modern Swedish state.
To investigate the mechanicus, the author employs multiple perspectives, methodologies, and sources. Textbooks and speeches are examined, which contain imagined narratives of mechanics' coming-of-age. Letters are analyzed where young men present themselves to the state administration as competent in mathematics and mechanics. Correspondence reveals how practitioners of mechanics crafted their identity in relation to the sovereign. Furthermore, protocols from the Swedish parliament and rural courts are studied, discussing matters related to mechanics and mathematics. By studying these diverse sources, the author explores the relationships between the actors (mechanical practitioners) and their audiences, considering not only what was written about mechanics but also for whom and why it was written.
The focus is on the processes through which men shaped themselves in response to the expectations of their audiences and the mechanicus. These "mechanical practitioners" are not seen as agents of change opposing the early modern order but rather as individuals striving to meet the expectations of their contemporaries. Therefore, the mechanicus is examined in relation to the social and natural orders of the time, as well as to religion, politics, and epistemologies (frameworks of knowledge production and categorization). The author investigates how engagement in mechanical exercises shaped and defined early modern men. Key questions addressed include the mechanicus' role within the early modern Swedish state, how men presented themselves as trustworthy and valuable subjects through mathematics and crafts, how they influenced the expectations surrounding the mechanicus, and how the successes and failures of mechanical practitioners in meeting contemporary expectations can be understood.

Methodological considerations and delimitations 
This thesis shifts the perspective on early modern mechanics in two ways. 
The first shift is a methodological one, from long narratives to a synchronic 
history. The study examines historical actors��� expectations of mechanics 
during the first half of the eighteenth century. As such, it diverges from 
13 
studies that analyse early modern mechanics in order to construct long nar- 
ratives of the making of modern phenomena such as industrialism, profes- 
sional engineers or modern technocratic states. In order to study eighteenth- 
century mechanics as aligned with its time, I make a methodological pledge 
of abstinence from such long narratives and from stabilising actors��� catego- 
ries by using analytical terms (i.e., modern terms that were alien to the his- 
torical actors themselves). The second shift is a geographical one, from Eng- 
land, which has often been staged as the source of modern industrialism, to 
the poor Northern-European state of Sweden. Chronologically, my cases 
range from the beginning of the 1700s to the mid century, a period during 
which Sweden underwent drastic governmental changes. From having been 
an absolutist state, in the 1720s it became a constitutional monarchy. The 
Swedish case thus highlights how expectations of mechanical practitioners 
were tied to shifting early modern political orders. Furthermore, these 
methodological and geographical shifts are interrelated: a study of the 
mechanicus in the Swedish state facilitates telling histories of early modern 
mechanics other than those of industrialisation or the rise of modern sci- 
ence. 
Over the twentieth century, the British industrial revolution became 
enrolled in liberal ideology and historiography, which described early mod- 
ern mechanical practitioners as agents of change. They thus came to be 
interpreted as ���entrepreneurial individuals operating in the private sphere, as 
opposed to the sphere of the state, who generated rational and useful 
knowledge.���2 The industrial revolution, and with it the interpretation of the 
historical role of mechanical practitioners, became ���embedded within de- 
bates over competing systems of political economy, primarily liberal democ- 
racy (free trade) versus socialism (state regulation).���3 This liberal narrative 
still shapes influential scholars��� interpretations of the relationship between 
eighteenth-century knowledge and the industrial revolution. For example, 
Joel Mokyr has argued for a position that attributes Western industrial de- 
velopment to both individual inventors and culture. For him, ���technological change involves an attack by an individual on a constraint that everyone else 
takes as given.���4 Mokyr sees the historical application to rational production 
of useful mechanical knowledge, found in small subcultures of knowledgea- 
ble men, as a key explanation of modern industrialism. In his view, small 
groups of mechanical practitioners were the cornerstones of an industrial 
enlightenment. In his account, this small subculture of rational men brought 
about the affluence of the post nineteenth-century Western world.5 Similar- 
ly, Margaret C. Jacob has recently argued that ���knowledge of the physical 
universe gave entrepreneurs a singular advantage���. By participating in con- 
temporary ���scientific culture���, such actors could approach mechanical pro- 
duction in ways previously deemed ���irrelevant to homo economicus as classical- 
ly formulated.���6 
Mokyr and Jacob both see mechanical practitioners as acting unexpect- 
edly in relation to contemporary culture. Here, I present an alternative nar- 
rative, where the self-presentations of mechanical practitioners are seen 
neither as opposing, nor as transgressing, contemporary audiences or cul- 
tures. Instead, I study these presentations as made in relation to the shifting 
and complex expectations of early modern audiences. By taking this ap- 
proach, I highlight the heterogeneous roles of early modern mechanics, and 
especially such roles that diverge from the assumption that mechanics 
should be studied as a new form of invention that emanated from England. 
In his recent The limits of matter (2015), Hjalmar Fors has criticised such uni- 
directional models, which proceed from an often ���unconscious, centrist 
historiographical assumption: that eighteenth-century invention proceeded 
from England.��� Instead, his study balances ���the substantial literature on the 
mechanical and technical aspects of early modern mining.���7 This study 
draws on Fors��� critique of centralist assumptions. However, I also argue that 
early modern mechanics does not have to be studied as a form of ���technol- 
ogy��� or ���innovation���. Instead, an interest in multiple and diverging mean- 
ings of mechanics motivates this study of the mechanicus in the early mod- 
ern Swedish state. There, a mechanicus was expected to be someone very 
different from the entrepreneurial individual, or innovator, who Mokyr and 
Jacob idolise as the maker of a modern order of production.

This thesis introduces two shifts in perspective on early modern mechanics. The first shift is methodological, moving away from long narratives and adopting a synchronic history approach. The focus is on examining historical actors' expectations of mechanics during the first half of the eighteenth century, diverging from studies that construct narratives of modern phenomena such as industrialism or professional engineers. The aim is to understand mechanics as aligned with its time and avoid imposing modern analytical terms on historical actors.
The second shift is geographical, moving from England, often portrayed as the source of modern industrialism, to Sweden. The cases studied range from the early 1700s to the mid-century, a period of significant governmental changes in Sweden from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. This highlights how the expectations of mechanical practitioners were linked to shifting early modern political orders. These methodological and geographical shifts are interconnected, allowing for alternative histories of early modern mechanics beyond industrialization or the rise of modern science.
The British industrial revolution became associated with liberal ideology and historiography, portraying mechanical practitioners as entrepreneurial individuals generating rational and useful knowledge. However, this liberal narrative has shaped interpretations of the relationship between eighteenth-century knowledge and the industrial revolution. Scholars like Joel Mokyr and Margaret C. Jacob attribute Western industrial development to individual inventors and the application of rational mechanical knowledge. They view mechanical practitioners as acting unexpectedly or transgressing contemporary culture.
In contrast, this thesis presents an alternative narrative where the self-presentations of mechanical practitioners are seen not as opposing or transgressing contemporary culture but as shaped by the shifting and complex expectations of early modern audiences. The focus is on the heterogeneous roles of early modern mechanics and the exploration of roles that diverge from the assumption that mechanics emerged solely from England. The study aims to highlight the multiple and diverging meanings of mechanics and the mechanicus in the early modern Swedish state. The mechanicus was expected to be someone different from the entrepreneurial innovator idolized by Mokyr and Jacob as the creator of a modern order of production.
This approach challenges centralist assumptions and moves away from studying mechanics purely as a form of technology or innovation. Instead, it seeks to explore the mechanicus as a concept embedded in its historical context and encompassing various expectations and meanings.

Chapter outline 
Mechanical practitioners can be found in numerous parts of the early mod- 
ern Swedish state apparatus and the cases I present here are not, nor do I 
want them to be, a complete description of early modern mechanics. In- 
stead, they are means of studying how mechanical practitioners made them- 
selves into subjects of the political order of their time. They all ask ques- 
tions of how mechanics was a self-forming exercise, and how it was a means 
of performing both submission and superiority in the civil service. Each 
chapter thus focuses on sources that illuminate these relationships. Rather 
than seeking a single institutional or geographical home for the mechanicus, 
I delineate his location in an eighteenth-century culture of superiority and 
submission. It would be possible to study other aspects of the mechanicus ��� 
for example, how mechanics was performed when actors travelled between 
works printed in German type, I represent sections printed in Antiqua for emphasis by using 
italics. I have generally been restrictive with adding italics for emphasis in my quotes. Hence, 
italics in quotes are from the original, unless stated otherwise.

states, or the expectations of, and demands on, mechanical performances in 
the military endeavours of the Swedish state. However, this is not my focus 
here, which is reflected in my choice of cases. 
This thesis has a thematic structure and is divided into four chapters, in 
addition to this introduction and the conclusion. Each of these four chap- 
ters studies the mechanicus through encounters between specific actors and 
audiences. The chapters gradually progress from the general to the specific. 
The chapter succeeding this introduction discusses mechanical coming-of- 
age narratives, as imagined by mature mechanical practitioners. It argues 
that mechanics was presented as a rite of passage ��� consisting of crafts and 
mathematics ��� through which a mechanically apt boy became a mechanicus 
with the virtues expected of a manly subject of a religious and political or- 
der. Then, in Chapter 3, I narrow the scope to a community of civil serv- 
ants, in the Swedish Bureau of Mines [Bergskollegium], formed around math- 
ematics and mechanics. Here I argue that in the Bureau, over the first half 
of the 1700s, mathematics developed from being the concern of a small 
group of mining mechanics to being a technique by which young men could 
become part of a community that saw the world in geometric and mechani- 
cal terms. In this chapter, I thus show how mathematical and mechanical 
exercise carried a symbolic role in a specific community of civil servants. In 
Chapter 4, I study the role of mechanics, mathematics and ��conomy in the 
correspondence of the mechanicus Christopher Polhammar and the abso- 
lute king Karl XII as well as of men in their vicinity. Through this corre- 
spondence, I discuss how two early modern personas ��� the monarch and 
the mechanicus ��� were performed in relation to each other. Finally, I pre- 
sent a case study of a single actor ��� the today virtually unknown mechanical 
practitioner Anders Gabriel Duhre ��� who first succeeded and then failed to 
present himself as a virtuous mechanicus to the parliament of the Swedish 
constitutional monarchy of the 1720s and 1730s. This case ties together 
many of the themes of the previous chapters, and analyses how a mechani- 
cal practitioner could succeed, and fail, in performing as a virtuous 
mechanicus in relation to various audiences in the state.

The thesis is divided into four chapters, each exploring different aspects of the mechanicus in the early modern Swedish state:
Chapter 1: Mechanical Coming-of-Age Narratives
This chapter examines how mature mechanical practitioners imagined mechanical education as a rite of passage for young boys. It explores the notion that mechanics, encompassing crafts and mathematics, was seen as a means for boys to acquire the virtues expected of a manly subject aligned with the religious and political order of the time.
Chapter 2: Mathematics and Mechanics in the Swedish Bureau of Mines
Focusing on a community of civil servants in the Swedish Bureau of Mines, this chapter discusses the development of mathematics from a concern of a small group of mining mechanics to a technique through which young men could become part of a community that viewed the world through geometric and mechanical terms. It highlights the symbolic role of mathematical and mechanical exercise within this specific civil service community.
Chapter 3: Mechanics, Mathematics, and Economy in Correspondence
Examining the correspondence between mechanicus Christopher Polhammar, King Karl XII, and their associates, this chapter explores how mechanics, mathematics, and economy intersected in their interactions. It delves into the performances of these two early modern personas and their relationship to each other.
Chapter 4: Case Study of Anders Gabriel Duhre
This chapter presents a case study of Anders Gabriel Duhre, a relatively unknown mechanical practitioner, who initially succeeded and then failed to present himself as a virtuous mechanicus to the parliament of the Swedish constitutional monarchy. It analyzes his experiences in performing as a virtuous mechanicus in relation to various audiences in the state, tying together the themes explored in the previous chapters.
In addition to these chapters, the thesis includes an introduction and a conclusion that provide an overview and synthesis of the findings.

In this chapter, imagination takes centre stage. Specifically, it focuses on 
how mechanics was imagined as a rite of passage. In prefaces, speeches and 
texts on education one finds reoccurring coming-of-age narratives, which 
revolved around boys��� performances of mechanics in relation to older expe- 
rienced men. Such texts imagined the life of a mechanicus to be a via media 
of a useful man, a middle ground in between a number of other personas: of 
the man of Latin, the pure mathematician and of the craftsman, to name but 
a few. These narratives are the objects of study of this chapter, and my aim 
is to understand how they were both expressions and constitutive of the 
mechanicus. Or in other words: how these narratives followed and formu- 
lated expectations on how to enter a form of useful manhood by perform- 
ing mechanical techniques such as mathematics and crafts. 
In 1716 the mechanical practitioner, Christopher Polhem (known as 
Polhammar until his ennoblement in December the same year), published a 
short treatise for the education of boys and young men in mathematics with 
the somewhat impervious title of The second foundation of wisdom. For the glory of 
youth, the usefulness of manhood and the pleasure of old age. In a short introduction, 
the author justified the book���s title: he explained that manhood was about 
maturity, and mathematics and mechanics were means of becoming mature. 
Because the young by nature tended primarily to reflect on things that gave 
them ���glory and honour, instead of long-term usefulness���, it would not hurt 
to ���spice up the latter with the former, in the book itself as well as its 
name���. In this way, boys would be guided into ���the usefulness of man- 
hood���, and would learn things that could earn them their daily bread. 
Polhem also wished that his book would give pleasure to the old who took 
delight in ���teaching and educating their child in everything related to their 
lawful work and well-being���. For him, mathematics was one of two pillars 
of a virtuous and useful life, the other being language.1 
Thirty-two years later, Lars Laurel ��� a philosopher and librarian at the 
University of Lund ��� commemorated the late mechanicus M��rten Triewald 
in the newly established Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In his speech, 
1 ���ber��m och heder, ��n nytta i lengden���; ���s�� wel i sielfwa wercket som nambnet bekryddar thet 
samma til hog af thet ena���; ���Mandoms nytta���; ���l��ra och underwisa sin barn i alt hwad som til

prydnad mandoms nytto och ��lderdoms n��je; lempadt f��r ungdomen efter theras tiltagande ��hr, uti dagliga lexor 
f��rdelt (Uppsala, 1716), ���En liten F��rklaring ��fwer Titlen���, unpaginated. 
40 
Laurel went off at a short historical tangent about how mechanics had re- 
cently become a manly activity: ���When our great king Karl XII lived, who 
never rested from battles or military accomplishments [k��mpedater],��� he ar- 
gued, ���we saw how the able young were mostly inclined to only weapons 
and armour.��� Everything else, ���though not less useful,��� was considered 
���not to be manly practices [karle-forer]���. Instead, according to Laurel, such 
techniques were considered the ���crafts of weaklings and women.��� 
2 But, 
Laurel contrasted: 
Under the government of our current beloved king, the conditions are 
again reversed. Alongside weapons, scholarly arts and handicrafts have 
come in fashion, so that there is almost no one who does not engage with 
them in some way. Thus, one may say that these peacetime deeds have 
never carried the honour and glory among us that they now claim.3 
While Polhem and Laurel both discussed mathematics and mechanics in 
relation to manhood and manliness, they did so from two different perspec- 
tives. Whereas Polhem treated manhood as the part of life between youth 
and old age, and mechanics as a means of maturity, Laurel argued that me- 
chanics had become a way to express a set of attributes that distinguished 
manly subjects from women, children and effeminate men. In eighteenth- 
century Sweden, the term ���manhood��� carried both these connotations; 
manhood was an age in which esteemed manly qualities could be identified, 
as well as the qualities that identified someone as having reached this age.

Chapter 1: Mechanics as a Rite of Passage
This chapter explores the coming-of-age narratives associated with mechanics in the early modern Swedish state. It examines how texts on education and prefaces imagined mechanics as a rite of passage, where boys' performances of mechanics in relation to older experienced men were emphasized. The chapter aims to understand how these narratives expressed and shaped the mechanicus, and how they established expectations for entering a form of useful manhood through the practice of mechanical techniques such as mathematics and crafts.
The chapter discusses examples such as Christopher Polhem's treatise "The Second Foundation of Wisdom" and Lars Laurel's speech commemorating mechanicus M��rten Triewald. Polhem's work highlights the role of mathematics and mechanics in achieving maturity and usefulness in manhood, while Laurel's speech reflects on the shift in perception where mechanics became associated with manly activities, contrasting it with the previous emphasis on weapons and armor. The chapter analyzes these perspectives on manhood and mechanics and their implications in eighteenth-century Sweden.
By examining these different perspectives, the chapter sheds light on how mechanics was seen as a means of achieving maturity and usefulness, as well as a way to express manly attributes that distinguished men from other groups such as women, children, and effeminate men. The notion of manhood encompassed both the age-related aspect and the qualities associated with being a man, reflecting the complex understanding of mechanics within the cultural context of early modern Sweden.

In this chapter, I study how mechanical practitioners imagined the com- 
ing of age of such a useful man through mechanical exercise using two 
complementary sources. The first category ��� where we can place Polhem���s 
preface ��� consists of fourteen prefaces, and introductions, of textbooks on 
mathematics and mechanics, written in Swedish and published roughly be- 
tween 1700 and 1750. Borrowing from Gerard Genette such texts, together 
with book titles, can be seen as the ���peritext��� of a book (as in ���periphery���), 
which frames its content. As such, introductions and prefaces are generally 
thresholds of interpretation. Thus, coming-of-age narratives of mechanics 
found in prefaces are especially interesting for understanding the meanings 
ascribed to a mechanicus, because they have been put in a textual space that 
2 ���N��r v��r uti strid och K��mpedater sig aldrig hvilande store Konung Kung CARL den XII lefde���; 
���s��ge vi den raske ungdomens hog m��st st�� til vapen och brynja allena���; ���ehuru icke mindre

aims to establish a shared understanding between author and reader.4 I sup- 
plement these prefaces with fourteen other, more general educational, texts 
that also discuss mathematics. The second category consists of fourteen 
commemorative speeches from the Swedish Academy of Sciences ��� such as 
the one by Laurel ��� that contain narratives of coming of age in which me- 
chanics and mathematics feature. These texts are from the mid 1700s, and 
they look back at and reminisce about boyhoods in the first half of the cen- 
tury. The two categories provide complementary narratives of mechanics and 
maturity: one looking forward, expressing an mature man���s gaze on boys 
and their path in life, and one looking backwards, in which men turn their 
eyes back onto themselves in trying to understand the product of the boys 
they once had been. These narratives of boys, childhood and manhood ��� 
prevalent in eighteenth-century texts on mechanics and mathematics ��� have 
attracted little attention from historians. Instead, as discussed in the previ- 
ous chapter, such sources have been used to understand early modern tech- 
nology. Likewise, autobiographies and commemorative speeches of me- 
chanical practitioners have been read as descriptive sources for biographies 
of exceptional individuals.5 Thus, by approaching these texts as narratives of 
manhood and ageing, I wish to highlight a completely different aspect of 
mechanics in early eighteenth-century Sweden ��� that is, mechanics as an 
exercise imagined to shape boys into a certain form of man, defined in rela- 
tion to a political order. 
In the following section, after a brief discussion of the meanings as- 
cribed to manhood and the ways in which it structured the early modern 
Swedish state, I turn to the sources where mechanical practitioners dis- 
cussed the signs of a mechanically apt boy and where they imagined ideal 
relationships between apt boys and experienced men such as themselves. 
Then, in the next two sections, I analyse the role of mathematics and crafts 
in these relationships and in the imagined coming of age of a mechanicus ��� 
in other words, how a range of authors imagined that performance of these 
two sets of techniques fostered a boy into a specific form of manhood.

In this chapter, the focus is on the coming-of-age narratives of mechanics and how they were imagined as a rite of passage. The author analyzes two categories of sources: prefaces and introductions of textbooks on mathematics and mechanics published between 1700 and 1750, and commemorative speeches from the Swedish Academy of Sciences in the mid-1700s. These sources provide narratives of mechanics and maturity from different perspectives ��� one looking forward and expressing the perspective of mature men on boys' paths in life, and the other looking backward as men reflect on their own past as boys.
The prefaces and introductions serve as peritexts, framing the content of the textbooks and providing insights into the meanings ascribed to a mechanicus. They establish a shared understanding between the author and the reader. The commemorative speeches, on the other hand, offer reflections on boyhood experiences and provide narratives of coming of age with mechanics and mathematics playing a role.
These narratives of boys, childhood, and manhood, prevalent in eighteenth-century texts on mechanics and mathematics, have been largely overlooked by historians who have focused more on technological aspects or exceptional individuals. By approaching these texts as narratives of manhood and aging, the chapter aims to highlight a different aspect of mechanics in early eighteenth-century Sweden ��� mechanics as an exercise that shaped boys into a specific form of manhood within the context of the political order.
The chapter begins with a discussion of the meanings attributed to manhood and how it structured the early modern Swedish state. It then delves into the sources where mechanical practitioners discussed the signs of a mechanically apt boy and imagined ideal relationships between boys and experienced men. The role of mathematics and crafts in these relationships and in the imagined coming of age of a mechanicus is also examined, focusing on how the performance of these techniques was believed to foster boys into a specific form of manhood.

A path to concord or confused indolence? 
In his Arithmetica Celsius proposed that, because mathematics was ���arranged 
in such a solid order,��� its diligent study produced a well-ordered mind in the 
student; it would ���dampen��� the inclination that ���the young generally have 
for such things, which only touch and please their external senses���. And just 
as mathematics would make the student���s mind well ordered, mathematics 
also made him behave orderly towards his peers. If boys studied mathemat- 
ics at a young age, ���less controversy would arise among scholars; fewer sug- 
gestions would be done against the truth, [and] one would hear fewer men 
who based their arguments on authority, without themselves considering 
whether it is true or false���. In the preface of the Arithmetica, and in many 
other similar prefaces from the time period, mathematics was not just imag- 
ined to be related to making knowledge, but also to be a technique of con- 
sent and a basis for a harmonious community of knowledge makers. By 
studying mathematics, a boy would thus learn to see the world in a new way. 
Such studies would discipline his reason and imagination, so that he would 
be governed neither by external appearances nor by his own youthful vanity 
or pursuit of glory. Also, he would learn to see connections between dispar- 
ate truths, and accept true statements by others without entering into un- 
necessary conflict. Ideally, mathematics was not only a way to see nature in 
a new light: it was also a way to relate differently to one���s fellow men. The 
student of mathematics would not only become reasonable or imaginative, 
73 ���N��r nu s��ledes Mathesis hade lika s��som borttagit det medf��dda t��ckelset f��r w��ra f��rst��nds 
��gon, s�� kunde man sedan wara beqw��mligare at med upt��kta ��gon se sanningen���; Celsius: 
Arithmetica, unpaginated preface. 63 
he would also acquire the virtue of concord.74 As discussed earlier, mathe- 
matics and mechanics were Rydelius��� chief examples of exercises that fos- 
tered a manly enlightened imagination, aligned with the rational theocratic 
order. He defined mathematical and mechanical creativity as requiring a 
certain kind of imaginative man, whose creativity was rational rather than 
emotional. By studying mathematics, a boy could learn to see past glory and 
private profit. Consequently, he could also become a pious subject, submit- 
ted not only to his own reason, but also to his sovereign and ultimately to 
the divine Lord.75 
The Conversation between a man and a woman discussed mathematics as an 
exercise of concord in more detail. When the woman of the narrative admit- 
ted that she was ���afraid [���] that my Son will become stubborn from [math- 
ematical studies], and [that he] will want to do everything as he himself 
pleases when he thinks he has reasons for it���, the protagonist calmed her: 
���the more he reads Euclid, the more he will understand to respect his rea- 
sonable mother; and the more he will accept her rational views.���76 Mathe- 
matics was an exercise of reason, and therefore also a means for a boy to 
discipline his own mind to submit to his reasonable superiors as well as to 
acquire authority to discipline others. By exercising his reason and his imag- 
ination, a boy would become a man who acted in the interest of the state 
and for the glory of God. But not all mathematics was an exercise of dis- 
cernment and concord. Even if a boy started his mathematical studies at the 
appropriate young age, he also needed to study mathematics correctly. 
While the dialogue presented mathematics as a technique for virtuous per- 
formances, it also presented its negative side. The woman of the dialogue 
presented the two sides of mathematics: 
I wish to have you as arbiter between my husband and me. We are always 
arguing over our son���s tutor. I believe that he is a good-natured man, but

the man replied, ���you say that he does not teach our son mathematics in the right way, and that he himself has learned mathematics incorrectly. Do you think that mathematics can be wrongly taught?��� The woman explained her concerns, saying, ���he has taught our son only those parts of mathematics that he himself understands and likes, and he does not pay attention to the boy���s inclination or abilities.��� The man agreed that this was a problem, stating, ���Mathematics can indeed be wrongly taught. It is not enough to simply learn the rules and formulas; one must also understand the principles and reasons behind them. Without a proper understanding, one may become confused and indolent in one's studies.���
This dialogue highlights the importance of studying mathematics correctly in order to cultivate the virtues of concord and reason. Merely memorizing formulas and rules without grasping the underlying principles can lead to confusion and laziness in one's studies. The proper study of mathematics, on the other hand, disciplines the mind, fosters a well-ordered perspective, and promotes harmonious relationships among scholars.
Overall, the chapter explores the idea that mathematics was not only a means of acquiring knowledge but also a technique of consent and a basis for a harmonious community. Through the diligent study of mathematics, a young boy would develop a well-ordered mind, discipline his reason and imagination, and learn to relate to others without unnecessary conflict. However, it is also emphasized that the correct approach to studying mathematics is crucial to avoid confusion and indolence.

my husband says that he informs our child of a bunch of unnecessary 
things. As our son is meant to become a priest, he says, it is futile to tor- 
ment him with triangles and circles and other fads and fancies, which [my 
husband] calls novelties [nyheter].77 
The protagonist first agreed: ���Your husband is right that triangles and cir- 
cles hardly will help your son eventually to deliver a sermon or to sing 
mass,��� but he continued, ���Geometry should be studied because it provides 
the habit of reasoning clearly.���78 The woman accepted this argument, but 
she explained that her husband was of the opposite opinion. He believed 
that: such figures and lines, if anything, make people confused, and [he] exem- 
plifies this by a certain mathematicus, whom I also thought was somewhat 
strange. However, I do not believe that mathematics was the cause of this. 
Instead, [this man] had stayed too much indoors by himself, reflecting up- 
on his figures, which had made him unaccustomed to the company of 
others.79 
The dialogue expressed two opposing opinions of mathematics as an 
educational practice. On the one hand, the protagonist gave voice to the 
belief that mathematics could raise a boy into a diligent man, aligned with a 
rational social and natural order. On the other hand, the husband argued 
that not only was mathematics of no use to most boys, it might even make 
them into confused men who failed to meet the demands of everyday life. 
What was at issue in these texts was the relationship between mathematics, 
the virtue of diligence and the epistemic virtues of theoria and praxis. As seen 
earlier, many authors presented mathematics using the metaphor of bodily 
exercise and they placed mathematics in the realm of praxis, as opposed to 
logic that was pure theoria; they all imagined mathematics as hard work, ra- 
ther than a simple mind game. In a Lutheran state, where diligence was a 
manly virtue, this way of discussing mathematics may not be that surprising: 
to discuss mathematics in relation to praxis was yet another way to present it 
as useful work that would foster a virtuous man. The dialogue thus sought 
to convince the reader that mathematics encompassed theoria as well as prax- 
is, and that it was an exercise not only of concord but also of diligence.

The dialogue presented contrasting views on the usefulness of mathematics in the education of a future priest. The husband believed that studying triangles, circles, and other mathematical concepts was unnecessary and futile for their son, who was destined to become a priest. He dismissed these mathematical topics as novelties and argued that they would only confuse and distract their son from his religious duties.
In response, the protagonist acknowledged that these geometric concepts might not directly contribute to their son's future role as a priest. However, he defended the study of geometry, emphasizing that it develops the habit of clear reasoning. While it may not have immediate practical application to delivering sermons or performing religious rituals, the protagonist argued that the discipline of mathematics fosters diligence and the ability to think logically.
The dialogue highlighted the contrasting perspectives on the value of mathematics in education. On one side, there was an emphasis on the practicality and usefulness of mathematics, promoting the virtues of diligence and clear reasoning. On the other side, there was skepticism about the relevance of mathematics to certain vocations, with concerns that it might lead to confusion and social isolation.
This debate touched upon the broader question of the relationship between mathematics, diligence, and theoria (theoretical knowledge) versus praxis (practical knowledge). Some authors saw mathematics as an exercise of both theoretical and practical virtues, aligning with the Lutheran emphasis on diligence as a valued virtue. By presenting mathematics as a disciplined pursuit, they sought to convince readers that it was not only a means of fostering concord but also an important aspect of diligent and virtuous manhood.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, I'm familiar with "San Bueno, M��rtir" by Unamuno. "San Bueno, M��rtir" is a play written by Miguel de Unamuno, a prominent Spanish writer and philosopher of the early 20th century. The play was first published in 1928. It tells the story of a fictional saint named San Bueno who, in the face of doubt and skepticism, maintains his faith and devotion. Unamuno explores themes of religious faith, martyrdom, and the nature of belief in the face of adversity. The play reflects Unamuno's own preoccupations with existential questions and his exploration of the human condition.

The plot of "San Bueno, M��rtir" revolves around the life and struggles of the titular character, San Bueno. The play is set in a small village in Spain during the early years of Christianity.
San Bueno is a humble and devout man who is deeply committed to his faith. He lives a simple life and is loved and respected by the villagers. However, as the story progresses, the townspeople begin to question and doubt the existence of God and the validity of their religious beliefs.
San Bueno becomes the target of skepticism and mockery from those around him, including the village priest. Despite facing intense pressure to renounce his faith and conform to the changing beliefs of the community, San Bueno remains steadfast in his devotion to God and refuses to waver in his beliefs.
As the tension escalates, San Bueno is eventually accused of blasphemy and heresy. He is put on trial, where he is given the opportunity to renounce his faith and save himself from persecution and death. However, San Bueno chooses to embrace martyrdom and willingly accepts his fate.
The play delves into themes of faith, doubt, and the struggle to maintain one's beliefs in the face of opposition. Unamuno explores the complexities of religious conviction and the power of faith in the midst of uncertainty and adversity.

Based on the limited information provided about the plot of "San Bueno, M��rtir," it is difficult to draw direct connections to our previous discussion on mechanics and coming-of-age narratives. However, if we consider the broader themes of faith, conviction, and the challenges faced by individuals who adhere to their beliefs despite opposition, we can find some overlapping ideas.
In the context of the discussion on mechanics, we explored how mechanical practitioners in early modern Sweden imagined their coming-of-age narratives and the virtues associated with their craft. Similarly, the character of San Bueno exemplifies a strong commitment to his faith and the values he holds dear, even when faced with skepticism and persecution from others.
Both contexts involve individuals who strive to maintain their identity and adhere to certain principles, whether it be the pursuit of mechanical knowledge or the preservation of religious faith. The challenges and conflicts they face highlight the importance of perseverance, integrity, and staying true to oneself in the face of opposition.
While the specific details of "San Bueno, M��rtir" may not directly align with our previous discussion, the broader themes of individual conviction, social pressures, and the struggle to maintain one's beliefs can be seen as resonating with the exploration of the mechanicus and their formation as virtuous and useful members of society.

Sorry I skipped a few sections: Manhood as pious submission 
In a patriarchy such as early modern Sweden, this fatherly role had implica- 
tions that extended beyond the relationship between man and boy. As ar- 
gued by Michael Roper and John Tosh, the study of patriarchy ���provides a 
way of integrating the individual and structural dimensions of male domi-

instead of as a general structure of power.11 In this Weberian sense, early

modern Sweden was profoundly patriarchal. The absolute monarchy of late 
seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Sweden was legitimated by Lu- 
theran theocratic ideology that merged the power of God, of the king and 
of fathers.12 God, who had created the world, was its lawful sovereign and, 
as such, he had delegated his power according to an order where fathers 
ruled over the women, servants and children of their house [hush��ll]. As 
mankind multiplied, the divine Lord had aggregated some of this fatherly 
power in the monarch, who would guarantee an orderly society under his 
rule.13 In this theocratic order, loyal subjects were identified through a hier- 
archy of virtues. In spite of being strongly associated with the male norm, 
the same hierarchy governed the expected performance of all subjects, 
woman or man. Still, the relative importance of the virtues, and how these 
virtues were supposed to be performed, differed according to social distinc- 
tions such as gender, social status and age.14 
At the top of this hierarchy of virtues was pietas, or piety. The modern 
concept of piety, with its mainly religious connotations, does not fully cap- 
ture the meaning of pietas in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Eu- 
rope. At this time, piety denoted the expected performance of a loyal sub- 
ject in a state where religion and politics were intertwined. Besides

social bodies, inseperable from the royal and religious authorities of the kingdom.���; ibid. The

The discussion of manhood in the early modern Swedish context was deeply connected to the concept of patriarchy and the power dynamics structured around "father-rule." The absolute monarchy of that time, legitimized by Lutheran theocratic ideology, emphasized the hierarchical order where fathers held authority over their households. This patriarchal structure extended to the broader society, with the king embodying the ultimate fatherly figure who ensured an orderly society under his rule.
Within this patriarchal framework, the performance of virtues played a crucial role. Piety (pietas) stood at the top of the hierarchy of virtues, encompassing both religious and political dimensions. Piety referred to the expected behavior of loyal subjects in a state where religion and politics were interconnected. It denoted the submission and devotion to God, the king, and one's own father.
The notion of piety was not limited to religious devotion but also encompassed the performance of one's social role and the adherence to societal norms. This expectation of piety applied to both men and women, although the specific ways in which the virtues were performed varied based on factors such as gender, social status, and age.
In the context of the discussion on mechanics and coming-of-age narratives, the concept of piety can be seen as an important aspect. The development of the mechanicus as a virtuous and useful member of society involved not only the acquisition of knowledge and skills but also the embodiment of pietas. The mechanicus was expected to demonstrate piety towards their craft, their superiors, and the divine order. By adhering to these expectations, the mechanicus would contribute to the harmonious functioning of the social and political order.
Overall, the discussion on manhood, piety, and the patriarchal structure in early modern Sweden provides a broader understanding of the cultural and ideological context in which mechanics and the formation of virtuous individuals took place.

"Like Water for Chocolate" is a novel written by Laura Esquivel, a Mexican author, in 1989. The story takes place in Mexico during the early 20th century and follows the life of the protagonist, Tita de la Garza.
The novel revolves around the theme of magical realism and explores the power of food and emotions. Tita, the youngest daughter of the De la Garza family, is forbidden to marry because of a family tradition that dictates the youngest daughter must remain unmarried to care for her mother until her death. Despite this restriction, Tita falls in love with Pedro, who instead marries her sister Rosaura to be close to Tita.
Throughout the novel, food serves as a powerful metaphor for expressing emotions and desires. Tita, who has a natural talent for cooking, infuses her dishes with her emotions, and those who consume the food experience those same emotions. The meals she prepares become a way to communicate her suppressed love and desire for Pedro.
As the story progresses, the intense emotions embedded in Tita's cooking lead to a series of events with magical and transformative consequences. The narrative blends Tita's personal experiences with the broader context of the Mexican Revolution, adding layers of historical and cultural significance to the story.
"Like Water for Chocolate" explores themes of love, desire, family traditions, and the roles assigned to women in Mexican society. It showcases the power of food as a form of expression and communication, as well as the influence of repressive societal norms on personal lives. The novel beautifully weaves together elements of magical realism, romance, and social commentary to create a captivating and evocative narrative.

CHAPTER I.




TWO OLD FRIENDS.




Chetwynde Castle was a large baronial mansion, belonging to the Plantagenet period, and situated in Monmouthshire. It was a grand old place, with dark towers, and turrets, and gloomy walls surmounted with battlements, half of which had long since tumbled down, while the other half seemed tottering to ruin. That menacing ruin was on one side of the structure concealed beneath a growth of ivy, which contrasted the dark green of its leaves with the sombre hue of the ancient stones. Time with its defacing fingers had only lent additional grandeur to this venerable pile. As it rose there --"standing with half its battlements alone, and with five hundred years of ivy grown"--its picturesque magnificence and its air of hoar antiquity made it one of the noblest monuments of the past which England could show.




All its surroundings were in keeping with the central object. Here were no neat paths, no well-kept avenues, no trim lawns. On the contrary, every thing bore the unmistakable marks of neglect and decay; the walks were overgrown, the terraces dilapidated, and the rose pleasaunce had degenerated into a tangled mass of bushes and briers. It seemed as though the whole domain were about to revert into its original state of nature; and every thing spoke either of the absence of a master, or else of something more important still--the absence of money.




The castle stood on slightly elevated ground; and from its gray stone ivy-covered portal so magnificent was the view that the most careless observer would be attracted by it, and stand wonder-struck at the beauty of the scene, till he forgot in the glories of nature the deficiencies of art. Below, and not far away, flowed the silvery Wye, most charming of English streams, winding tortuously through fertile meadows and wooded copses; farther off lay fruitful vales and rolling hills; while in the distance the prospect was bounded by the giant forms of the Welsh mountains.




At the moment when this story opens these beauties were but faintly visible through the fast-fading twilight of a summer evening; the shadows were rapidly deepening; and the only signs of life about the place appeared where from some of the windows at the eastern end faint rays of light stole out into the gloom.




The interior of the castle corresponded with the exterior in magnificence and in ruin--in its picturesque commingling of splendor and decay. The hall was hung with arms and armor of past generations, and ornamented with stags' heads, antlers, and other trophies of the chase; but rust, and mould, and dust covered them all. Throughout the house a large number of rooms were empty, and the whole western end was unfurnished. In the furnished rooms at the eastern end every thing belonged to a past generation, and all the massive and antiquated furniture bore painful marks of poverty and neglect. Time was every where asserting his power, and nowhere was any resistance made to his ravages. Some comfort, however, was still to be found in the old place. There were rooms which were as yet free from the general touch of desolation. Among these was the dining-room, where at this time the heavy curtains were drawn, the lamps shone out cheerily, and, early June though it was, a bright wood-fire blazed on the ample hearth, lighting up with a ruddy glow the heavy panelings and the time-worn tapestries. Dinner was just over, the dessert was on the table, and two gentlemen were sitting over their wine--though this is to be taken rather in a figurative sense, for their conversation was so engrossing as to make them oblivious of even the charms of the old ancestral port of rare vintage which Lord Chetwynde had produced to do honor to his guest. Nor is this to be wondered at. Friends of boyhood and early manhood, sharers long ago in each other's hopes and aspirations, they had parted last when youth and ambition were both at their height. Now, after the lapse of years, wayworn and weary from the strife, they had met again to recount how those hopes had been fulfilled.




The two men were of distinguished appearance. Lord Chetwynde was of about the medium size, with slight figure, and pale, aristocratic face. His hair was silver-white, his features were delicately chiseled, but wore habitually a sad and anxious expression. His whole physique betokened a nature of extreme refinement and sensibility, rather than force or strength of character. His companion, General Pomeroy, was a man of different stamp. He was tall, with a high receding brow, hair longer than is common with soldiers; thin lips, which spoke of resolution, around which, however, there always dwelt as he spoke a smile of inexpressible sweetness. He had a long nose, and large eyes that lighted up with every varying feeling. There was in his face both resolution and kindliness, each in extreme, as though he could remorselessly take vengeance on an enemy or lay down his life for a friend.




As long as the servants were present the conversation, animated though it was, referred to topics of a general character; but as soon as they had left the room the two friends began to refer more confidentially to the past.




"You have lived so very secluded a life," said General Pomeroy, "that it is only at rare intervals that I have heard any thing of you, and that was hardly more than the fact that you were alive. You were always rather reserved and secluded, you know; you hated, like Horace, the _profanum vulgus_, and held yourself aloof from them, and so I suppose you would not go into political life. Well, I don't know but that, after all, you were right."

CHAPTER VI.




TWO IMPORTANT CHARACTERS.




About five years passed away since the events narrated in the last chapter. The General's household had left their London lodgings not long after Guy's visit, and had removed to the family seat at Pomeroy Court, where they had remained ever since. During these years Guy had been living the life common with young officers, moving about from place to place, going sometimes on a visit to his father, and, on the whole, extracting an uncommonly large amount of enjoyment out of life. The memory of his betrothal never troubled him; he fortunately escaped any affair of the heart more serious than an idle flirtation in a garrison town; the odd scene of his visit to General Pomeroy's lodgings soon faded into the remote past; and the projected marriage was banished in his mind to the dim shades of a remote future. As for the two old men, they only met once or twice in all these years. General Pomeroy could not manage very well to leave his daughter, and Lord Chetwynde's health did not allow him to visit Pomeroy. He often urged the General to bring Zillah with him to Chetwynde Castle, but this the young lady positively refused to consent to. Nor did the General himself care particularly about taking her there.

In Chapter VI of "The Cryptogram: A Novel" by James De Mille, the story fast-forwards five years since the events of the previous chapter. During this time, Guy, one of the main characters, has been leading a carefree life as a young officer, traveling from place to place and enjoying various experiences.
Despite being engaged, Guy's betrothal to Zillah, the daughter of General Pomeroy, doesn't weigh heavily on his mind. He avoids getting involved in any serious romantic entanglements and considers his upcoming marriage as something in the distant future. The memory of his visit to General Pomeroy's lodgings, where he encountered the cryptogram, has become a distant and vague recollection.
In the meantime, General Pomeroy and Lord Chetwynde, Guy's father, have had limited contact. The General remains devoted to his daughter and prefers to stay close to her at Pomeroy Court. Lord Chetwynde, due to his health issues, is unable to visit Pomeroy and often invites the General and Zillah to his own residence, Chetwynde Castle. However, Zillah adamantly refuses to go, and the General doesn't express much interest in the invitation.
This chapter sets the stage for the next phase of the story, where new developments and challenges await the characters as they navigate their relationships and confront the mysteries surrounding the cryptogram.

"How could I help loving Miss Pomeroy's father?" replied Miss Krieff, with the old stealthy smile reappearing.




"Is he not just and honorable?"




"Both--more too--he is generous and tender. He is above all a fond father; so fond," she added, with something like a sneer, "that all his justice, his tenderness, and his generosity are exerted for the exclusive benefit of that darling child on whom he dotes. I assure you, you can have no idea how touching it is to see them together."




"Do you often feel this tenderness toward them?" asked Gualtier, turning his thin sallow face toward her.




"Always," said Miss Krieff, slowly. She rose from her chair, where she had taken her seat, and looked fixedly at him for some time without one word.




"You appear to be interested in this family," said she at length. Gualtier looked at her for a moment--then his eyes fell.




"How can I be otherwise than interested in one like you?" he murmured.




"The General befriended you. He found you in London, and offered you a large salary to teach his daughter."




"The General was very kind, and is so still."




Miss Krieff paused, and looked at him with keen and vigilant scrutiny.




"Would you be shocked," she asked at length, "if you were to hear that the General had an enemy?"




"That would altogether depend upon who the enemy might be."




"An enemy," continued Miss Krieff, with intense bitterness of tone--"in his own family?"




"That would be strange," said Gualtier; "but I can imagine an enemy with whom I would not be offended."




"What would you think," asked Miss Krieff, after another pause, during which her keen scrutinizing gaze was fixed on Gualtier, "if that enemy had for years been on the watch, and under a thin veil of good-nature had concealed the most vengeful feelings? What would you say if that enemy had grown so malignant that only one desire remained, and that was--to do some injury in some way to General Pomeroy?"




"You must tell me more," said Gualtier, "before I answer. I am fully capable of understanding all that hate may desire or accomplish. But has this enemy of whom you speak _done_ any thing? Has she found out any thing? Has she ever discovered any way in which her hate may be gratified?"




"You seem to take it for granted that his enemy is a woman!"




"Of course."




"Well, then, I will answer you. She _has_ found out something--or, rather, she is in the way toward finding out something--which may yet enable her to gratify her desires."




"Have you any objections to tell what that may be?" asked Gualtier.




Miss Krieff said nothing for some time, during which each looked earnestly at the other.




"No," said she at last.




"What is it?"




"It is something that I have found among the General's papers," said she, in a low voice.




"You have examined the General's papers, then?"




"What I said implied that much, I believe," said Miss Krieff, coolly.




"And what is it?"




"A certain mysterious document."




"Mysterious document?" repeated Gualtier.




"Yes."




"What?"




"It is a writing in cipher."




"And you have made it out?"




"No, I have not."




"Of what use is it, then?"




"I think it may be of some importance, or it would not have been kept where it was, and it would not have been written in cipher."




"What can you do with it?" asked Gualtier, after some silence.




"I do not yet see what I can do with it, but others may."

"What others?"




"I hope to find some friend who may have more skill in cryptography than I have, and may be able to decipher it."




"Can you not decipher it at all?"




"Only in part."




"And what is it that you have found out?"




"I will tell you some other time, perhaps."




"You object to tell me now?"




"Yes."




"When will you tell me?"




"When we are better acquainted."

"Yes," said Hilda; "and that occurs most frequently."




"What is it all?"




"I take it to be a secret cipher."




"How?"




"Why, this--that these signs are only used to represent letters of the alphabet. If such a simple mode of concealment has been used the solution is an easy one."




"Can you solve cipher alphabets?"




"Yes, where there is nothing more than a concealment of the letters. Where there is any approach to hieroglyphic writing, or syllabic ciphers, I am baffled."




"And have you solved this?"

"It seems to me that it must consist of hieroglyphics. You yourself say that you have only made out a part of it, and that you doubt whether it is a valid interpretation. After all, then, your interpretation is only partial--only a conjecture. Now I have not begun to make even a conjecture. For see--what is this?" and Gualtier drew the well-thumbed paper from his pocket. "I have counted up all the different characters here, and find that they are forty in number. They are composed chiefly of astronomical signs; but sixteen of them are the ordinary punctuation marks, such as one sees every day. If it were merely a secret alphabet, there would be twenty-six signs only, not forty. What can one do with forty signs?

"That never occurred to me," said Gualtier. "Why did you not tell me?"




"Because I wanted you to decipher it yourself on your own principle. Of what use would it be if you only followed over my track? You would then have come only to my result. But I must tell you the result of my examination. After counting up the recurrence of all the letters on more than two hundred pages of standard authors, I made out an average of the times of their recurrence, and I have the paper here on which I wrote the average down."

O.....100 times per page.    W.....30 times per page.



R.....100 times per page.    G.....30 times per page.




"The rest," said Miss Krieff, "occur on the average less than thirty times on a page, and so I did not mark them. 'F,' 'P,' and 'K' may be supposed to occur more frequently than some others; but they do not.




"'E,' then," she continued, "is the letter of first importance in the English language. 'A,' and 'T,' and 'H,' are the next ones. Now there are some little words which include these letters, such as 'the.' 'And' is another word which may be discovered and deciphered, it is of such frequent occurrence. If these words only can be found, it is a sign at least that one is on the right track. There are also terminations which seem to me peculiar to the English language; such as 'ng,' 'ing,' 'ed,' 'ly,' and so on. At any rate, from my studies of the Italian, French, and German, and from my knowledge of Hindustani, I know that there are no such terminations in any of the words of those languages. So you see," concluded Miss Krieff, with a quiet smile, "the simple principle on which I acted."

"Yes. The old cipher writing was there--shut up--concealed carefully, jealously--doubly concealed, in fact. Was not this enough to show that it had importance in the eyes of the man who had thus concealed it? It must be so. Nothing but a belief in its immense importance could possibly have led to such extraordinary pains in the concealment of it.

Heart rate detection is a serious business, but that doesn���t mean we can���t have a little fun with it! And what better way to bring some humor to the topic than with the help of computer vision and Eulerian Magnification?

Heart rate measurement using computer vision technology
Using YOLOv7 for Face Detection and Eulerian Magnification for Heart Rate Detection
Now, I know some of you may be thinking, ���Ritz, why do we need computer vision to detect our heart rate? Can���t we just feel our own pulse?��� Well, my friends, let me tell you, computer vision is like having a personal heart rate detective on call 24/7. It can detect your heart rate even when you���re asleep, or watching your favorite TV show, or watching a YouTube channel like Augmented Startups.

Heart rate measurement using computer vision technology
Heart Rate Detection on Multiple People
But what is Eulerian Magnification, you ask? Think of it like a ���zoom in, zoom out��� feature for your heart rate. It���s a technique that uses computer vision to magnify small changes in color and brightness, making it easier to detect even the slightest changes in heart rate. It���s like having a magnifying glass for your heart.

One example of how this technology can be used is with the use of YOLO models like YOLOv7 or YOLOv8. These models can be used to detect the head of a person and then apply Eulerian Magnification to detect changes in heart rate. This way, even if a person is wearing a mask or has their head covered, the model can still detect their heart rate by tracking the blood flow on their face.

But why stop at just detecting heart rate? With the power of Eulerian Magnification, we can also use computer vision to detect other vital signs like breathing rate and even the amount of sweat on your forehead. So, the next time you���re at the gym, and you���re feeling a little nervous about how much you���re sweating, just remember that the camera might be able to tell how hard you���re working by the amount of sweat on your forehead.

But let���s be real, who wants to be monitored all the time? The good news is, Eulerian Magnification can also be used in a more fun and entertaining way. Have you ever wanted to see your own heartbeat in slow motion? With Eulerian Magnification, we can now do just that!

An example of using our Eulerian Video Magnification framework for visualizing the human pulse. (a) Four frames from the original video sequence. (b) The same four frames with the subject's pulse signal amplified. (c) A vertical scan line from the input (top) and output (bottom) videos plotted over time shows how our method amplifies the periodic color variation. In the input sequence the signal is imperceptible, but in the magnified sequence the variation is clear.

 

Abstract
Our goal is to reveal temporal variations in videos that are difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye and display them in an indicative manner. Our method, which we call Eulerian Video Magnification, takes a standard video sequence as input, and applies spatial decomposition, followed by temporal filtering to the frames. The resulting signal is then amplified to reveal hidden information. Using our method, we are able to visualize the flow of blood as it fills the face and also to amplify and reveal small motions. Our technique can run in real time to show phenomena occurring at temporal frequencies selected by the user.

Abstract
Many important physical phenomena involve subtle signals that are difficult to observe with the unaided eye, yet visualizing them can be very informative. Current motion magnification techniques can reveal these small temporal variations in video, but require precise prior knowledge about the target signal, and cannot deal with interference motions at a similar frequency. We present DeepMag, an end-to-end deep neural video-processing framework based on gradient ascent that enables automated magnification of subtle color and motion signals from a specific source, even in the presence of large motions of various velocities. The advantages of DeepMag are highlighted via the task of video-based physiological visualization. Through systematic quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the approach on videos with different levels of head motion, we compare the magnification of pulse and respiration to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our method produces magnified videos with substantially fewer artifacts and blurring whilst magnifying the physiological changes by a similar degree.

Abstract
Objects in the world are constantly in motion, and it is crucial for us to observe how they change. Although our visual system possesses significant levels of perception and interpretation of motion, it has limited sensitivity, the observer cannot perceive minor motions which are below the visual sensing threshold. Minor motion cannot readily be perceived via conventional methods. In this paper, a Euler motion amplification method based on the back projection of the derivative is proposed, in which the Riesz pyramid decomposition is applied for achieving a better hierarchical reconstruction. Compared to more traditional methods, the method proposed herein can hold much larger magnification, has lower time complexity, and is more resistant to noise. Experiments have demonstrated that the given algorithm achieves better minor magnification with the evaluation of the objective quantitative evaluation indicators.

Introduction
Mammalian visual perception systems have a limited perception capability. For minor motion change is too minute so as to be beyond their perception, the individual���s eyes are unable to directly sense it. For example, the breathing of a baby causes undulations in the chest, blood circulation gives rise to the subtle periodic changes in the skin of the human body, or the slight sway of the tower crane at a high elevation. However, such minor motions sometimes carry important information, which reveals the objects��� motion tendency and amplitude. The frequency of the baby���s breathing is a manifest signal for a doctor to derive a physical diagnosis without touching the infant, and the blood circulation changes show the human heart rate which carries the individuals��� physical status. This paper concentrates on the minor motion magnification for gaining a better sense of the motion status.

An object���s minor motion undergoes movement that remains unperceived by conventional methods. The conventional methods mainly track the motion trajectory based on the partial differential equation, and the extracted local movement change approaches zero when the tiny motion occurs. In this paper the minor motion embodied by the object is amplified based on multi-spectral decomposition [1], which decomposes the motion into multiple spectrums for conveniently analyzing the movement in each one. As we know, multiple spectrums equivalent to the original provide many channels so that the motion detection methods can examine the existing movement from the spectrum. In this paper, the spectral decomposition is exploited for processing the hitherto undetectable motion.

The minor motion detection from a video concentrates the examination on the frequency phase. Even in the frequency domain, it is still hard to perceive minor motion, especially in the frequency amplitude, so in this paper the phase is employed for detecting such minor motion. As we know, the amplitude and the phase are the two important pieces of information, but according to the phase-shift principle of Fourier transform, the displacement information of the motion is mainly reflected by the phase, and is independent of the amplitude. Meanwhile, the amplitude changes produce some artifacts, so in this paper the amplitude is kept unchanged, and the phase residual between those neighboring frames is extracted to describe the minor motion.

Phase embodied by minor motion generally involves multiple spectral bands. To directly locate the phase from the original signal is not enough, so in this paper the hierarchical handling manner is employed. The pyramid is used for acquiring the minor motion phase, the phase in each level is magnified, these boosted phases are then collected and synthesized, and the magnified phase is added back into the original video. In the phase synthesis process, since the images exhibit different signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) at different spatial frequencies, the lower the spatial frequency, the higher the SNR. In order to prevent the synthesis distortion, we propose that these different spectral bands are applied to different magnification scalars, then all minor motion information are retained in the magnified motion.

In this paper, a method of minor motion magnification is proposed, which includes the minor motion extraction, boost and syntheses, and all processes are based on the phase handling. The discussed method measures the tiny motion by acquiring the local phase change with the newly constructed back projection of the derivative (BPD) Riesz pyramid, amplifies the phase by within spectral bands, and reconstructs the video with magnified minor motion. The given method has the following advantages: the manifest amplification effect, higher resistance to noise corruption, and lower time complexity which can achieve real-time minor video magnification.

Abstract 
The goal of video motion magnif i cation techniques is to magnify small motions in a video to reveal previously invis- 
ible or unseen movement. Its uses extend from bio-medical applications and deepfake detection to structural modal 
analysis and predictive maintenance. However, discerning small motion from noise is a complex task, especially when 
attempting to magnify very subtle, often sub-pixel movement. As a result, motion magnif i cation techniques generally 
suf f er from noisy and blurry outputs. This work presents a new state-of-the-art model based on the Swin Transformer, 
which of f ers better tolerance to noisy inputs as well as higher-quality outputs that exhibit less noise, blurriness, and 
artifacts than prior-art. Improvements in output image quality will enable more precise measurements for any ap- 
plication reliant on magnif i ed video sequences, and may enable further development of video motion magnif i cation 
techniques in new technical i elds.

1. Introduction 
Video Motion Magnif i cation (VMM) is a computer vision task consistent in magnifying small motions in a video 
sequence, having several uses in many i elds from bio-medical applications [1���3] and deepfake detection [4] to struc- 
tural modal analysis [5] and condition monitoring. These techniques act like a microscope for motion, to reveal 
previously invisible or unseen movements. Despite this simple premise, discerning small motions from noise is a 
complex task, especially when attempting to magnify very subtle, often sub-pixel movement. As a result, motion 
magnif i cation techniques generally suf f er from noisy and blurry outputs. Therefore, multiple authors have explored 
techniques to remediate these shortcomings and improve magnif i cation quality and performance. 
Early motion magnif i cation algorithms, such as [6], used a Lagrangian approach, reliant on motion tracking or 
optical l ow, to isolate motion prior to magnif i cation. However, this approach is very computationally expensive and 
dif i cult to execute artifact-free, especially in regions af f ected by occlusion boundaries and complex motion. On the

other hand, more modern techniques [7���11] have relied on Eulerian approaches, which observe the changes in a i xed 
region of pixels instead of tracking features in time and space. These Eulerian approaches are less computationally 
expensive, perform better with small motions, and generally yield better magnif i cation results. Nevertheless, these 
approaches still display noticeable blurring and artifacting due to the complex challenge of designing i lters for noise 
removal, which at the same time, do not interfere with motion magnif i cation. For this reason, Oh et al. [12] proposed a 
novel learning-based approach to VMM. Learning-based motion magnif i cation departs from the use of hand-designed 
i lters in favor of learning those i lters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) instead. This method achieved 
higher-quality magnif i cation yielding fewer ringing artifacts and showing better noise characteristics than previously 
published methods. However, its reliance on additional temporal i ltering to improve image quality sometimes pro- 
duces errors in magnif i cation. While it is possible to obtain fairly clear results with no temporal i ltering, the image 
quality generally improves when i ltering is applied as it removes unwanted motion and noise before learning-based 
magnif i cation.

hand, Lagrangian approaches explicitly track a pixel or feature���s movement throughout a video sequence. This dis- 
tinction between Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches is not dissimilar to the same terms used in l uid dynamics, 
where Lagrangian methods [6] track a volume of l uid through the l ow, while Eulerian approaches [8, 7, 9] study the

small motion but produce blurry results when encountering large motion. The technique presented in this paper be-

Eulerian techniques generally consist of three stages: spatial decomposition, motion isolation and manipulation, 
and representation denoising. From this blueprint, dif f erent authors have proposed increasingly sophisticated tech- 
niques to improve magnif i cation quality and performance as ref l ected in table 1. In technical terms, the motion 
magnif i cation problem can be summarized as follows. Given a signal I(x,t) representing image intensity at position x 
and time t, and ��(t) representing translational motion in time such that 
I(x,t) = f(x + ��(t)); I(x,0) = f(x)(1) 
The goal of motion magnif i cation is to synthesize the signal 
��I(x,t) = f(x + (1 + ��) �� ��(t)) 
(2) 
for some amplif i cation factor ��. In practice, only certain frequencies of motion ��(t) are useful to motion magnif i cation, 
so a selector T(��) is applied to ��(t), which is typically a temporal bandpass i lter.

Table 1: Motion magnif i cation techniques summary table. Adapted from [12]. 
Prior to learning-based VMM (LB-VMM), magnif i cation techniques relied on multi-frame temporal i ltering to 
isolate motions of interest from random noise [7���9, 13, 11]. By contrast, the learning-based approach [12] directly 
employs CNNs to both i lter noise and extract features, achieving comparable or better quality than prior-art without 
3 
using temporal i ltering. The LB-VMM model is composed of three stages: encoder, manipulator, and decoder. Said 
model is designed to accept two frames and return a single motion-magnif i ed frame. The goal of the encoder is to 
extract relevant features from each of the two input frames and yield a visual and a motion representation. The mo- 
tion representation of both input frames is then passed to the manipulator, which will subtract both representations 
and magnify the result by an arbitrary parameter �� def i ned by the user. Finally, the results of the manipulator and 
the previously-obtained visual representation enter the decoder, where the motion and visual components are recon- 
structed into a motion-magnif i ed frame. These three CNN-based components allow for l exible learnable i lters that 
are better suited to the task of motion magnif i cation and thus yield better quality magnif i cation results. 
To train the model and given the impossibility of obtaining motion magnif i ed video pairs, Oh et al. generated and 
used a fully-synthetic dataset for training their model, built by moving segmented objects from the PASCAL VOC [14] 
dataset over background images taken from MS COCO [15]. Careful consideration to the generation of the dataset 
was paid to ensure accurate pixel and sub-pixel motion as well as learnability. The dataset learning examples are 
parametrized to make sure they are within a def i ned range. Specif i cally, the dataset���s magnif i cation is upper-limited 
to an �� magnif i cation factor of 100, and input motion is sampled so that magnif i ed motion does not exceed 30 pixels. 
2.2. Transformers as a Computer Vision tool 
CNNs have been a staple of the Computer Vision (CV) i eld in the last few years, with many of the top-performing 
models having made extensive use of them [16���18]. This period roughly started after Krizhevsky et al. [17] won 
the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [19, 20] (ILSVRC) on September 30th2012, and spurred 
many publications employing CNNs and GPUs to accelerate deep learning. Through the use of i lters, these networks 
generate feature maps that summarize an image���s most relevant parts. These i lters capture relevant local information 
by the very nature of the convolution operation, which, combined with multi-scale architectures [21, 22] result in rich 
feature maps that can ef i ciently obtain a representation of an image���s content, both in a local and global context. 
Recently, the CV i eld has been revolutionized yet again by the Vision Transformer (ViT) [23], which, employing the 
attention mechanism has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in many CV tasks. The attention mechanism was 
i rst popularized in the i eld of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by Vaswani et al. [24], where the transformer 
architecture has become the de-facto standard. 
The attention mechanism can be described as mapping from a query and a set of key-value pairs into an output. 
The output, represented in vector format, is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned 
to each value is computed by a compatibility function taking into account the query and the corresponding key [24]. 
The transformer was the i rst model which exclusively relied on self-attention to compute representations of its input 
and output without using sequence-aligned recursive neural networks or convolution operations.

The table provided summarizes various motion magnification techniques and their respective approaches in spatial decomposition, motion isolation, and representation denoising. Prior to the introduction of learning-based video motion magnification (LB-VMM), techniques relied on multi-frame temporal filtering to isolate motion from noise. LB-VMM, on the other hand, employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to filter noise and extract features, achieving comparable or better quality without the need for temporal filtering.
The LB-VMM model consists of an encoder, manipulator, and decoder. The encoder extracts relevant features from input frames to obtain visual and motion representations. The manipulator subtracts the motion representations and magnifies the result based on a user-defined parameter. Finally, the decoder reconstructs the motion-magnified frame using the visual and motion components.
To train the LB-VMM model, a fully synthetic dataset was generated using objects from the PASCAL VOC dataset and background images from MS COCO. The dataset was carefully designed to ensure accurate pixel and sub-pixel motion and learnability.
The second part of the text discusses the use of transformers as a computer vision tool. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in computer vision tasks, but recently, transformers, employing the attention mechanism, have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Transformers have shown success in tasks such as natural language processing (NLP), and the Vision Transformer (ViT) has revolutionized the field of computer vision.
The attention mechanism in transformers maps queries and key-value pairs to compute weighted sums of values, producing representations without relying on recursive neural networks or convolutions. Transformers have become the standard in NLP and have gained prominence in computer vision with the ViT architecture.
Overall, the use of transformers, specifically the Swin Transformer, in the proposed STB-VMM model offers improved magnification quality, noise tolerance, and artifact reduction compared to prior techniques. This research contributes to the field of motion magnification, enabling better analysis and visualization of small motions in videos.

Unlike CNNs, trans- 
4 
formers lack translation invariance and a locally-restricted receptive i eld, in its place transformers of f er permutation 
invariance. Said feature enabled NLP models to infer relations between words and ideas much further into a text than 
previous recurrent models could. However, CV applications require the processing of grid-structured data which can 
not trivially be processed by a transformer. The ViT [23] overcame this burden by mapping grid-structured data into 
sequential data by splitting the image into patches. Patches are then l attened into vectors and embedded into a lower 
dimension. These l attened patches are then summed with positional embeddings and fed as a sequence to a standard 
transformer encoder. Image patches essentially become sequence tokens just like words are when working in NLP, in 
fact, ViT uses the exact same encoder described in [24]. 
Later, Microsoft researchers improved on the ViT publishing the SWIN transformer, a hierarchical vision trans- 
former using shifted windows [25]. This work further ref i ned the solution to adapt the original transformer from 
language to vision. The SWIN transformer solved issues caused by large discrepancies in the scale of visual entities 
at the same time that limited self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows, yet still allowing for cross- 
window interaction. The introduced limitation on the scope of self-attention signif i cantly reduced the computational 
complexity, which scales quadratically with respect to image size, allowing for the processing of higher-resolution 
images that were previously unmanageable. Further developments in the CV i eld have implemented the SWIN trans- 
former for various tasks achieving state-of-the-art performance [26���28]. 
2.3. SwinIR image restoration 
Inspired by the recent prominence of the transformer and its success in many CV problems such as image classif i- 
cation [29, 23, 30, 25, 31���33], object detection [34���36], segmentation [30, 37, 38], crowd counting [39, 40] and image 
restoration [41���43], Liang et al. [27] proposed a new state-of-the-art image restoration model based on the Swin trans- 
former [25]. The SwinIR model consists yet again of three modules: a shallow feature extractor, a transformer-based 
deep feature extractor and a high-quality image reconstruction module. This structure of f ers excellent performance in 
various image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, JPEG compression artifact reduction, and image de- 
noising. These applications are very interesting when working with VMM, as current state-of-the-art methods can be 
negatively af f ected by noisy input images, causing much noisier and blurrier results, especially at large magnif i cation 
rates. This occurs as a result of noise not being properly i ltered beforehand, therefore as the motion gets magnif i ed, 
the noise gets magnif i ed as well.

Transformers, unlike CNNs, do not possess translation invariance and a locally-restricted receptive field. Instead, transformers offer permutation invariance, which has been beneficial in NLP tasks. However, computer vision applications require processing grid-structured data, which cannot be directly handled by transformers. The Vision Transformer (ViT) addressed this challenge by splitting images into patches, flattening them into vectors, and embedding them into a lower dimension. These flattened patches are then treated as sequence tokens and processed by a standard transformer encoder.
The Swin Transformer was later introduced as an improvement upon the ViT, specifically designed for vision tasks. It utilized shifted windows to handle the large scale discrepancies of visual entities while limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows. This limitation significantly reduced computational complexity, allowing for the processing of higher-resolution images that were previously challenging. The SWIN transformer has been successfully applied to various computer vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
In the domain of image restoration, the Swin Transformer has shown remarkable results. Liang et al. proposed the SwinIR model, which consists of a shallow feature extractor, a transformer-based deep feature extractor, and a high-quality image reconstruction module. SwinIR has demonstrated excellent performance in image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, JPEG compression artifact reduction, and image denoising. These applications are particularly relevant to video motion magnification, as noisy input images can lead to noisier and blurrier results during magnification. SwinIR helps address this issue by effectively filtering noise and improving the overall image quality before motion magnification.

3. Methodology 
3.1. Residual Swin Transformer Block 
The Residual Swin Transformer Block (RSTB) [27] is used as one of the fundamental building blocks of the 
proposed architecture, appearing in parts of both the feature extractor and the reconstructor. The RSTB is a residual 
block combining multiple Swin Transformer Layers (STL) [25] and convolutional layers, compounding the benef i ts of 
the spatially invariant i lters of the convolutional layers with the residual connections that allow for multilevel feature 
processing. 
The Swin transformer layer shown in i gure 2 partitions an H �� W �� C image into non-overlapping 
HW 
M2 local 
windows using an MxM sliding window and then computing its local attention, ef f ectively reshaping the input image 
into 
HW 
M2 �� M2�� C. The main dif f erence with respect to the original transformer layer [24] lies in the local attention 
and the shifted window mechanism. For a local window feature F ��� RM 2��C, the query, key, and value matrices Q, K, 
and V ��� RM 2��d are computed as Q = FWQ;K = FWk;V = FWV(3) 
where WQ, WK, and WVare the learnable parameters shared across dif f erent windows, and d is the dimension of Q, 
K, and V. Therefore, the attention matrix is computed for each window as 
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax( QKT 
���d+ 
P)V(4) 
where P is the learnable relative positional encoding. Computing the attention mechanism multiple times yields 
the results of the Multi-head Self Attention (MSA), which are then passed on to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). 
Therefore, the whole STL process can be summed up like so 
F = MSA(LayerNorm(F)) + F(5) 
then F = MLP(LayerNorm(F)) + F(6) 
where the MLP is formed by two fully-connected layers with a GELU activation layer in between.

In the proposed architecture, the Residual Swin Transformer Block (RSTB) serves as a fundamental building block and is utilized in both the feature extractor and the reconstructor. The RSTB combines multiple Swin Transformer Layers (STL) and convolutional layers to leverage the benefits of spatially invariant filters and residual connections for multilevel feature processing.
The Swin Transformer Layer partitions an input image of size H �� W �� C into non-overlapping local windows using an MxM sliding window. It then computes local attention within each window, transforming the input image into HW/M2 �� M2 �� C. The local attention and shifted window mechanism are the main differences compared to the original transformer layer. Query, key, and value matrices Q, K, and V are computed for each window, and the attention matrix is obtained by applying softmax to the similarity between Q and K. The attention mechanism is computed multiple times, resulting in the Multi-head Self Attention (MSA), which is then passed through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
The entire STL process can be summarized as follows:
Compute the attention mechanism: F = MSA(LayerNorm(F)) + F
Apply the MLP: F = MLP(LayerNorm(F)) + F
The MLP consists of two fully-connected layers with a GELU activation layer in between. The use of residual connections allows for the fusion of local attention and spatially invariant filters, enhancing the feature representation and preserving important details in the magnified output.

3.2. Network architecture 
The proposed model architecture, shown in i gure 1, consists of three main functional blocks: the feature extractor, 
the manipulator, and the reconstructor. The feature extractor is further subdivided into the shallow and deep feature 
extractors, and their job is to extract a high-quality representation of an input frame. Next, the manipulator, using the 
features from two frames, magnif i es the motion by multiplying the dif f erence between the two feature spaces by a 
user-selected magnif i cation factor ��. Finally, the reconstructor converts the resulting manipulated feature space back 
into a magnif i ed frame. Figure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model. 
Given two frames of a target sequence [IA,IB] ��� RH��W��Cin(where H is the height of the image, W is the width of 
the image and Cinrepresents the number of input channels) the convolutional shallow feature extractor (GSF) maps 
high-level features into a higher dimensional feature space, thus providing early local feature extraction (FAS,FBS) 
and leading to a more stable optimization and better results [44]. 
[FAS,FBS] = GSF([IA,IB])(7) 
7 
Then, the features extracted in the previous step are further processed in the deep feature extraction module (GDF), 
which consists of N Residual Swin Transformer Blocks (RSTB). 
[FAD,FBD] = GDF([FAS,FBS])(8) 
After feature extraction, both frames��� feature spaces are then sent to the manipulator [12] (GM), which works by 
taking the dif f erence of both frames��� feature spaces and directly multiplying by a magnif i cation factor ��. 
GM(FAS+ FAD,FBS+ FBD) = (FAS+ FAD) + h(�� �� t(((FBS+ FBD) ��� (FAS+ FAD))))(9) 
Where t(��) is a 3��3 convolution followed by a ReLU activation, and h(��) is a 3��3 convolution followed by a 3��3 
residual block. FM= GM(FAS+ FAD,FBS+

The proposed model architecture consists of three main functional blocks: the feature extractor, the manipulator, and the reconstructor. The feature extractor is divided into the shallow and deep feature extractors, responsible for extracting high-quality representations of the input frames. The manipulator takes the features from both frames and magnifies the motion by multiplying the difference between the feature spaces by a user-selected magnification factor ��. Finally, the reconstructor converts the manipulated feature space back into a magnified frame.
Given two frames [IA, IB] of a target sequence, the convolutional shallow feature extractor (GSF) maps the frames into a higher-dimensional feature space, providing early local feature extraction. The features extracted by GSF are denoted as [FAS, FBS].
These features are further processed in the deep feature extraction module (GDF), which consists of N Residual Swin Transformer Blocks (RSTB). The deep feature extraction step produces [FAD, FBD], which are the deep features extracted from the input frames.
The manipulator (GM) takes the combined shallow and deep features from both frames and computes the difference. It then multiplies the difference by the magnification factor ��. The output of the manipulator is given by:
GM(FAS + FAD, FBS + FBD) = (FAS + FAD) + h(�� �� t(((FBS + FBD) - (FAS + FAD))))
In the above equation, t(��) represents a 3��3 convolution followed by a ReLU activation, and h(��) represents a 3��3 convolution followed by a 3��3 residual block.
The reconstructor module reconstructs the magnified frame by applying the reconstructor function (GR) to the manipulated feature space:
GR(GM(FAS + FAD, FBS + FBD)) = magnified frame
The proposed architecture leverages the capabilities of the Swin Transformer and residual connections to enhance motion magnification and produce high-quality magnified frames with reduced blurring, noise, and artifacts.

Oh et al. [12] proposed one additional operation mode with temporal i ltering to mitigate the ef f ects of undesired 
motion and noise. The i ltering was applied in the manipulator to produce temporarily-f i ltered motion-magnif i ed 
frames similar to those of classical techniques. On the downside, the temporal mode appears to cause blindness to 
small motions, resulting in patchy magnif i cation. This phenomenon occurs because motion amplitude crosses the 
threshold to be large enough to be detected and causes some regions to be suddenly magnif i ed mid-sequence. This 
performance degradation gets worst when the magnif i cation factor is high and motion is small. While theoretically 
possible to incorporate a temporal mode into the proposed model, the magnif i cation results do not suf f er from exces- 
sive noise or blurring, therefore, temporal i ltering is unnecessary and the full spectrum of frequencies is magnif i ed 
all at once producing good results. 
4. Results and discussion 
In the following section, the results yielded by the STB-VMM model are compared to the current state-of-the-art 
learning-based video motion magnif i cation model [12]. Performance is measured quantitatively and qualitatively, 
showing that our model improves on the previous state-of-the-art in magnif i cation quality and clarity. The video 
versions of all the comparisons are available in the supplementary materials. 
Quantitative comparison of image quality or Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a complex topic involving many 
variables and methods. Said methods are divided into three main categories: full-reference, reduced-reference, and 
no-reference. A referenced algorithm [46���48] requires a pristine sample to assess the quality of a degraded image, 
while no-reference methods [49���52] produce an image score without the need of any reference. When evaluating 
VMM it is impossible to obtain a pristine motion-magnif i ed frame. Therefore, to evaluate the results presented in the 
following section the MUSIQ [52, 53] algorithm was chosen to compare the models��� performance. 
The following results comparative analyzes the performance of Oh et al.���s Learning-Based Video Motion Mag- 
nif i cation (LB-VMM) model and STB-VMM on ten dif f erent video benchmarks that showcase interesting motion 
magnif i cation examples. In addition, a comparison against the baby [7] sequence is added to provide a fair point of 
comparison. The sequences were captured at 1080p 60fps on a mid-range smartphone to demonstrate the potential of 
STB-VMM with accessible video equipment. 10

Table 2 shows the average, 1st, and 99th percentile average MUSIQ scores for the tested benchmark sequences 
ran on the Learning-based Video Motion Magnif i cation model and the STB-VMM model. The values presented in 
the table are calculated for each individual frame of the full sequences and then summarized on an average score. 
The original sequences are also added as control, and scores are expected to be higher than both of the magnif i cation 
methods.

In their work, Oh et al. [12] introduced an additional operation mode with temporal filtering to mitigate the effects of undesired motion and noise in their learning-based video motion magnification model. However, this temporal mode was found to cause blindness to small motions and resulted in patchy magnification. While it could theoretically be incorporated into the proposed STB-VMM model, it was deemed unnecessary as the magnification results of STB-VMM did not suffer from excessive noise or blurring.
The results and discussion section compares the performance of the STB-VMM model to the previous state-of-the-art LB-VMM model quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluation of image quality is complex and involves various methods such as full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference algorithms. In this case, the MUSIQ algorithm was chosen to compare the performance of the models.
The quantitative comparison presents the average, 1st percentile, and 99th percentile average MUSIQ scores for ten different video benchmarks. These scores are calculated for each individual frame of the sequences and then summarized with an average score. The original sequences are included as a control, with scores expected to be higher than those of the magnification methods.
Please note that the specific results of the comparative analysis and the values presented in Table 2 are not provided in the available text.

5. Conclusions 
This work presents a new state-of-the-art model for video motion magnif i cation based on the Swin Transformer 
that has been shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art learning-based models. The new model displays better 
noise tolerance characteristics, a less blurry output image, and better edge stability, resulting in clearer and less noisy 
magnif i cation with very few, if any, artifacts. 
On the downside, the new model requires more computing resources than previous models and cannot be run in 
real-time like phase-based methods [8]. Nevertheless, applications that require precise magnif i cation for vibration 
monitoring [5] could greatly benef i t from improvements in the technology. Further work will address the integration 
of this model in specif i c applications that require precise vibration monitoring and could benef i t from a full-f i eld 
solution like a camera instead of installing and wiring multiple contact sensors such as accelerometers.

Motion magnification analysis of microscopy videos of biological cells

Abstract
It is well recognized that isolated cardiac muscle cells beat in a periodic manner. Recently, evidence indicates that other, non-muscle cells, also perform periodic motions that are either imperceptible under conventional lab microscope lens or practically not easily amenable for analysis of oscillation amplitude, frequency, phase of movement and its direction. Here, we create a real-time video analysis tool to visually magnify and explore sub-micron rhythmic movements performed by biological cells and the induced movements in their surroundings. Using this tool, we suggest that fibroblast cells perform small fluctuating movements with a dominant frequency that is dependent on their surrounding substrate and its stiffness.

Abstract
Recent progress of artificial intelligence makes it easier to edit facial movements in videos or create face substitutions, bringing new challenges to anti-fake-faces techniques. Although multimedia forensics provides many detection algorithms from a traditional point of view, it is increasingly hard to discriminate the fake videos from real ones while they become more sophisticated and plausible with updated forgery technologies. In this paper, we introduce a motion discrepancy based method that can effectively differentiate AI-generated fake videos from real ones. The amplitude of face motions in videos is first magnified, and fake videos will show more serious distortion or flicker than the pristine videos. We pre-trained a deep CNN on frames extracted from the training videos and the output vectors of the frame sequences are used as input of an LSTM at secondary training stage. Our approach is evaluated over a large fake video dataset Faceforensics++ produced by various advanced generation technologies, it shows superior performance contrasted to existing pixel-based fake video forensics approaches.

Video motion magnification techniques allow us to see small motions previously invisible to the naked eyes, such as those of vibrating airplane wings, or swaying buildings under the influence of the wind. Because the motion is small, the magnification results are prone to noise or excessive blurring. The state of the art relies on hand-designed filters to extract representations that may not be optimal. In this paper, we seek to learn the filters directly from examples using deep convolutional neural networks. To make training tractable, we carefully design a synthetic dataset that captures small motion well, and use two-frame input for training. We show that the learned filters achieve high-quality results on real videos, with less ringing artifacts and better noise characteristics than previous methods. While our model is not trained with temporal filters, we found that the temporal filters can be used with our extracted representations up to a moderate magnification, enabling a frequency-based motion selection. Finally, we analyze the learned filters and show that they behave similarly to the derivative filters used in previous works. Our code, trained model, and datasets will be available online.
