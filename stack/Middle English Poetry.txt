Some more poetry like this: Than he gan bihold about al,
And seighe liggeand within the wal
Of folk that were thider y-brought
Thanne sagh he there, as in a thought,
A wonder geste, as him leste
Of alle the folk that he sagh there
He sagh noght oon that did him care
But al was lost that he hadde y-knowe
And he was to himself unknowe.
This passage is written in Middle English, which is a form of English spoken between the 11th and 15th centuries. The passage is describing a person who is looking around and sees a scene of people lying within a wall. The person doesn't recognize anyone and feels disconnected from everyone he sees. It also suggests that the person is in a state of wonder or confusion.
Add a section in a summilar style to the front, starting with an O.
Oft in the stille of the night,
When the moon was hie on the light,
He gan to wandre forth alone,
And caste his eyen on the stone
That was y-set in the hille's side,
And knewe the wonder that ther bide.
This passage is also written in Middle English and it sets up a scene of a person wandering alone at night and looking at a stone set in a hillside. It implies the person is aware of some kind of mystery or wonder associated with the stone. The use of words like "stille" and "light" creates a eerie and contemplative mood.
Combine these, still starting with O, but no moon or night. Oft in the stille of the night,
When the moon was hie on the light,
He gan to wandre forth alone,
And caste his eyen on the stone
That was y-set in the hille's side,
And knewe the wonder that ther bide. Thanne sagh he there, as in a thought,
A wonder geste, as him leste
Of alle the folk that he sagh there
He sagh noght oon that did him care
But al was lost that he hadde y-knowe
And he was to himself unknowe.
Oft in the stille of the day,
He gan to wandre forth to stray,
And caste his eyen on the stone
That was y-set in the hille's cone,
And knewe the wonder that ther bide,
Thanne sagh he there, as in a tide,
A wonder geste, as him leste
Of alle the folk that he sagh there
He sagh noght oon that did him care
But al was lost that he hadde y-knowe
And he was to himself unknowe.
This passage combines the two previous passages, but removes the setting of night and moon. The person is now wandering during the day and looking at a stone on a hill cone, and again discovers a scene of people with a sense of wonder, confusion and disconnection. The repetition of the phrase "sagh he there" creates a sense of continuity between the two parts and the use of "stille of the day" creates a different mood than "stille of the night" from the first passage, making it less eerie and contemplative and more peaceful and contemplative.
A title starting with Orpheus
