Abstract
Dimension reduction is one of the key data transformation techniques in machine learning and knowledge discovery. It can be realized by using linear and nonlinear transformation techniques. An additive autoencoder for dimension reduction, which is composed of a serially performed bias estimation, linear trend estimation, and nonlinear residual estimation, is proposed and analyzed. Compared to the classical model, adding an explicit linear operator to the overall transformation and considering the nonlinear residual estimation in the original data dimension significantly improves the data reproduction capabilities of the proposed model. The computational experiments confirm that an autoencoder of this form, with only a shallow network to encapsulate the nonlinear behavior, is able to identify an intrinsic dimension of a dataset with low autoencoding error. This observation leads to an investigation in which shallow and deep network structures, and how they are trained, are compared. We conclude that the deeper network structures obtain lower autoencoding errors during the identification of the intrinsic dimension. However, the detected dimension does not change compared to a shallow network. As far as we know, this is the first experimental result concluding no benefit from a deep architecture compared to its shallow counterpart.

The paper, authored by Tommi K��rkk��inen and Jan H��nninen in Neurocomputing Volume 551, introduces an additive autoencoder for dimension reduction in data transformation techniques used in machine learning and knowledge discovery. The additive autoencoder, comprised of bias estimation, linear trend estimation, and nonlinear residual estimation performed serially, offers improved data reproduction capabilities over classical models. This improvement is achieved by adding an explicit linear operator to the transformation and considering nonlinear residual estimation at the original data dimension. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder, even with a shallow network, can effectively identify a dataset's intrinsic dimension while maintaining low autoencoding error. A comparison between shallow and deep network structures showed that, although deeper networks yield lower autoencoding errors, the identified intrinsic dimension remains unchanged. The study notably finds no advantage in using deep network architectures over shallow ones for this application, marking a significant observation in the field.

Researchers from the University of Jyv��skyl�� were able to simplify the most popular technique of artificial intelligence, deep learning, using 18th-century mathematics. They also found that classical training algorithms that date back 50 years work better than the more recently popular techniques. Their simpler approach advances green IT and is easier to use and understand.


The recent success of artificial intelligence is significantly based on the use of one core technique: deep learning. Deep learning refers to artificial intelligence techniques where networks with a large number of data processing layers are trained using massive datasets and a substantial amount of computational resources.

Deep learning enables computers to perform complex tasks such as analyzing and generating images and music, playing digitized games and, most recently in connection with ChatGPT and other generative AI techniques, acting as a natural language conversational agent that provides high-quality summaries of existing knowledge.

Six years ago, Professor Tommi K��rkk��inen and Doctoral researcher Jan H��nninen conducted preliminary studies on data reduction. The results were surprising: If one combines simple network structures in a novel way then depth is not needed. Similar or even better results can be obtained with shallow models.

"The use of deep learning techniques is a complex and error-prone endeavor, and the resulting models are difficult to maintain and interpret," says K��rkk��inen. "Our new model in its shallow form is more expressive and can reliably reduce large datasets while maintaining all the necessary information in them."

The structure of the new AI technique dates back to 18th-century mathematics. K��rkk��inen and H��nninen also found that the traditional optimization methods from the 1970s work better in preparing their model compared to the 21st-century techniques used in deep learning.

"Our results ensure that the use of neural networks in various applications is easier and more reliable than before," suggests H��nninen. The study is published in the journal Neurocomputing.

Simpler models lead to greener and more ethical AI
Artificial intelligence has an increasingly significant role in modern technologies and, therefore, it is more and more important to understand how AI does what it does.

"The more transparent and simpler AI is, the easier it is to consider its ethical use," says K��rkk��inen. "For instance, in medical applications deep learning techniques are so complex that their straightforward use can jeopardize patient safety due to unexpected, hidden behavior."

The researchers note that simpler models can help develop green IT and are more environmentally friendly because they save computational resources and use significantly less energy.

The results, which challenge the common beliefs and currently popular perceptions with deep learning techniques, were difficult to get published.

"Deep learning has such a prominent role in research, development, and the AI business that, even if science always progresses and reflects the latest evidence, the community itself may have resistance to change."

"We are very interested to see how these results will be received in the scientific and business community," says K��rkk��inen. "Our new AI has a range of applications in our own research, from nanotechnology for better materials in the sustainable economy to improving digital learning environments and increasing the reliability and transparency of medical and well-being technology."

Researchers from the University of Jyv��skyl�� have developed a simplified AI technique using 18th-century mathematics that doesn't rely on deep learning. They discovered that traditional training algorithms, some dating back 50 years, outperform recent popular techniques. This simplified approach not only advances green IT due to its reduced computational resource requirements but is also easier to use and understand.
Six years prior, initial studies by Professor Tommi K��rkk��inen and Doctoral researcher Jan H��nninen on data reduction found that depth in network structures isn't necessary for effective results, as shallow models could achieve similar or even superior outcomes. According to K��rkk��inen, deep learning techniques are complex and prone to errors, making the resulting models hard to maintain and interpret. In contrast, their new shallow model is more expressive and can efficiently reduce large datasets while preserving essential information.
The researchers' approach, rooted in 18th-century mathematics, found that optimization methods from the 1970s are more effective in training their model than contemporary deep learning techniques. This breakthrough promises to make the use of neural networks in various applications more straightforward and reliable. Furthermore, simpler AI models contribute to the development of green and ethical AI by being more transparent, easier to understand, and consuming less energy.
K��rkk��inen notes that the complexity of deep learning techniques in applications like healthcare could potentially endanger patients due to unforeseen, hidden behaviors in the AI. He expresses interest in seeing how the scientific and business communities will receive their findings, as their new AI model can be applied in various fields including nanotechnology, digital learning environments, and medical technology, enhancing their reliability and transparency.
Long-Term Memory Overview 
When conscious STM experiences images that cycle repeatedly, conditions may be 
triggered to permit them to be entered automatically into LTM. Images in LTM are 
not just visual pictures, but include a variety of sensory impressions, songs heard, 
words read, and impressions in general that have run through STM. What is entered 
automatically into LTM are particular collections of attributes that make up a 
mental image. 
LTM is somewhat analogous to mass memory in a desktop computer in that it 
remains hidden until it is called upon. However, LTM in humans differs consider- 
ably from LTM in personal computers: Human memory is associative; all images 
are queried in parallel for matches to given cues. In contrast, computer memory 
generally depends on knowing a numerical address, and these are looked at serially, 
one at a time. 
LTM and learning are two completely different things. Learning may involve 
synaptic potentiation and growth over a period of time; LTM can be formed 
immediately, too fast for growth, yet lasts practically forever. 
For example, many of us have experienced dramatic or emotional events that 
occurred quickly, but are i rmly remembered. This is a salient feature of LTM; they 
can be established practically immediately, and they can last indef i nitely. LTM, as 
the term is used in this book, does not require synaptic growth. But it instead uses 
charge mechanisms that can react immediately. These mechanisms seem to be very 
different from those of STM neurons. 
The exact mechanisms for LTM are still being discussed. How they work is not 
obvious because neurons do not release many signals compared to solid-state 
devices, making them diff i cult to observe in action, especially since they probably 
202Brain Architecture for an Intelligent Stream of Consciousness 
are active for only a brief time, and then only if triggered. Generally speaking, 
neurons are relatively small and easily upset by probing, so direct in vivo observa- 
tion is diff i cult. Note for the record that memory elements are located randomly and 
duplicated extensively, so given memory episodes are nearly impossible to locate 
experimentally, meaning particular unwanted memories are diff i cult to remove 
surgically. 
An interesting theory is that needed attributes are held eff i ciently by LTP [2]. 
Another interesting theory is that recursive neurons support cycling pulses that use 
almost no energy, and that are readable with positive signals for needed attributes 
[3]. A hybrid element using LTP and recursive neurons is proposed in a later 
chapter, giving instant memorization as well as eff i cient long-term storage. 
Elements of LTM as needed for a neural system have to be readily accessible to 
conscious STM, and it is critically important that they have ability to be queried; so 
a logical system is suggested.

The passage provides an overview of Long-Term Memory (LTM). LTM is likened to the mass memory of a computer, holding images not limited to visual ones but encompassing various sensory impressions, songs, words, and general impressions that have traversed Short-Term Memory (STM). These images in LTM are collections of attributes forming a mental image, entered automatically under certain conditions.
While similar, human LTM is distinct from computer memory. Human memory is associative, searching for image matches in parallel in response to cues, whereas computer memory retrieves information serially using numerical addresses. LTM in humans can be established swiftly, sometimes instantaneously in the case of significant or emotional events, and can last indefinitely. This quick formation of LTM does not rely on synaptic growth but on fast-acting charge mechanisms, differing from the mechanisms of STM neurons.
The exact mechanisms underlying LTM remain a topic of discussion due to the challenge of observing neurons, which release few signals and are sensitive to probing. Furthermore, memory elements are both randomly located and extensively duplicated, complicating the pinpointing and removal of specific memories. The passage also mentions theories related to Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and recursive neurons that facilitate instant memorization and efficient long-term storage, providing accessible elements for a neural system crucial for interaction with conscious STM. These elements should be easily queryable, necessitating a logical system.
Introduction to a Memory-Based Brain System 
When considering a neural system that results in a stream of consciousness, it may 
be noted that nature evolves according to certain principles. Entities of nature, 
including brains, can survive only if, on the average, they are eff i cient.1Concepts 
such as the grandmother neuron, in which all attributes are stored in a single large 
neuron, have to be discounted because they are incompatible with bringing forth an 
image into conscious STM in an eff i cient way. 
Transferring images from LTM into STM, and transferring images from STM 
into LTM must also be eff i cient. This implies that each attribute located in STM 
directly corresponds to a similar attribute located in LTM, an architectural feature 
known as distributed memory [4] to be discussed later. 
This one-to-one correspondence implies that memory is logically organized into 
words. Memory words are a logical, not a physical, structure. Since not every image 
contains every possible attribute, memory words are sparse. Sparse means that 
entries in a word are separated by unused places corresponding to where certain 
attributes are not present, and that these places hold either unused neurons or 
neurons that have been turned to some other purpose. 
Excitatory synapses serve to initiate neural pulses; inhibitory synapses serve to 
moderate neural pulses, as does the capacitance of larger bodies such as the soma, 
all of which results in a pulse-based system of logic. Memorization and other brain 
capabilities depend on dendritic logic which occurs mainly in dendrites where 
Boolean operations are accomplished, as verif i ed in part by simulations of 
dendrites. 
1Maupertuis principle of least action that nature is thrifty in all of its actions. 
Introduction to a Memory-Based Brain System21 
Another form of logic, known as enabled logic, occurs for larger bodies of 
capacitance, for instance, somas, as presented in a later chapter. As a result, a 
complete set of Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) is available, a natural result of 
synaptic activity in combination with active and passive regions in dendrites, soma, 
and sometimes also axons. Dendritic logic is compared to enabled logic in a later 
chapter. 
Systems are typically expressed in terms of logical, not physical, structures, and 
brain systems are no exception. Human LTM is associative, which hints that 
location is not a prime consideration; things are recalled not according to where 
they are, but according to what they are. In contrast, in a desktop computer, each 
word in memory has a unique address, and a physical place. Addresses are used for 
reading or writing to locations that may be chosen at random, so the choice is 
random. Hence the term random access memory, or RAM. Human memory, in 
contrast, does not have i xed addresses, so we know a lot less about where 
memories reside. 
Retrieval from subconscious LTM begins with cues. For example, seeing 
someone���s dog can bring forth a memory of your own faithful companion, and 
might even bring forth details of face, color, size, and so on. Other such examples 
are visiting your home neighborhood which brings forth memories of stores, houses, 
rooms,passageways,andsoon; seeinga bookthatyouusedincollegecanbringforth 
memories of what you learned in those days. Cues are essential to memory retrieval. 
Cues need to be chosen judiciously from the current contents of conscious STM. 
If the available cues do not result in a recall, editing is available to adjust the cues 
for another try. Hopefully there will be a hit, which means an exact match to the 
cues. Memories with attributes that exactly match the applied cues will be read for 
possible entry into conscious STM. Cues applied to LTM have to be exact, since 
LTM are called forth only for exact matches. Gratefully, old memories are dormant 
until receiving an exact set of cues. Serious overload would result if we had to 
experience all facts, even irrelevant ones, at all times. 
Under the distributed model each attribute connects to specif i c locations in STM 
andcorresponding locations withinwordsofLTM.These locations exist physically, 
although current technology does not permit a knowledge of exact location. But 
nevertheless each location in STM has corresponding locations in LTM that are 
reserved for a particular feature. This is an eff i cient way to organize STM and LTM 
becauseitavoidsextraencodingandthepassingofdatatointermediarystoragesites. A given attribute might be said to have meaning not because it has any special 
coding, but because of its physical location in a word. For example, the color red 
might be in a certain location, say the 537th cell from the left in a delineation of 
logical STM; it is also the 537th cell from the left in each of its replications in LTM. 
Location in memory and the context in which the attribute is used contribute to 
realizing the meaning of an attribute, as for example, when seeing a i re engine in 
the context of a street, it is expected to be red. 
The one-on-one distributed model implies that neurons are not multiplexed, that 
is, different attributes are not communicated by the same neuron. Fortunately 
neurons are quite plentiful and are conveniently dedicated to a given attribute as 
described. 
222Brain Architecture for an Intelligent Stream of Consciousness 
Human memory is not erasable and is not converted into blank words in the 
ordinary sense, nor can words be overwritten as they are in the RAM of desktop 
computers. Once something is committed to memory, it is there indef i nitely. In this 
sense, LTM is akin to read only memory (ROM). Under the ROM concept, new 
brain memories cannot overwrite old memories; instead they must be written into 
blank words available for that purpose, the subject of a later chapter.
ChatGPT
The introduction discusses a memory-based brain system focusing on the interaction between Short-Term Memory (STM) and Long-Term Memory (LTM). For an efficient stream of consciousness, the transfer of images between STM and LTM must be efficient. There is a one-to-one correspondence between attributes in STM and LTM, characteristic of a distributed memory system. Memory words, which are logical structures rather than physical, are sparse due to not every image containing all possible attributes.
Various logical processes are highlighted, including excitatory and inhibitory synapses initiating and moderating neural pulses, respectively, leading to a pulse-based logic system. The system utilizes dendritic logic, primarily occurring in dendrites for executing Boolean operations, and enabled logic, associated with larger capacitance bodies. Together, these logics provide a complete set of Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT) accessible for use in the brain���s memory system.
Human memory is distinguished from computer memory by its associative nature, implying that memory retrieval is based on content rather than location. The introduction emphasizes the role of cues in memory retrieval, where specific prompts can elicit related memories from LTM. Unlike computer memory, human memory lacks fixed addresses, and its exact physical locations are unknown, though there is a corresponding location in LTM for every attribute in STM. This efficient arrangement avoids additional encoding and intermediary storage, with the meaning of an attribute derived from its physical location and context.
Human memory, which is non-erasable and not overwritable, is compared to Read-Only Memory (ROM) in computers. Once information is committed to memory, it remains indefinitely. This ROM-like nature of human memory implies that new memories don���t overwrite old ones but are allocated to available spaces, a topic to be explored further in subsequent chapters.
A System for Stream of Consciousness 
A system of consciousness can now be sketched: Simulations of neural logic have 
suggested a brain system based on bottom-up construction. Attributes are calculated 
from the senses and are made to enter conscious STM as an image, but alternated 
with the senses are images in the form of a set of attributes from memory recalls. 
Attributes currently in conscious STM are a main source of cues, which are not 
necessarily perfect. 
For conf l icting or overdetermined sets of cues, or too many cues, editing is 
essential. Editing strives to remove conf l icting cues to achieve returns. For 
underdetermined cues, when cues are few in number, one expects an excessive 
number of returns. In this case, returns are edited subliminally, and the one that 
calculates to be most important is selected for entry into STM, where it becomes a 
recall. Figure 2.2 shows how these two major editors form what may be construed 
to be a cybernetic2system, that is, a system in which attributes selected from a 
current image are used to determine the next image. 
A system for stream of consciousness may be summarized as follows. A set of 
attributes in STM are taken as cues and serve to i nd related images in associative 
LTM. A high-priority recall is selected from the resulting returns, and overwrites 
the fading contents of STM. The process repeats, giving a moving picture in conscious STM.
ChatGPT
The passage outlines a proposed system for stream of consciousness based on simulations of neural logic, designed from a bottom-up perspective. In this system, attributes derived from sensory input are calculated and entered into conscious Short-Term Memory (STM) as an image. These sensory-derived images alternate with images formed from sets of attributes recalled from memory.
Cues, which are primarily derived from attributes currently within conscious STM, are essential in this system. These cues might not always be perfect and could sometimes be conflicting, overdetermined, or too numerous. In such cases, a process of editing is crucial. This editing process aims to remove conflicting cues, helping to facilitate the retrieval of relevant memory returns. When cues are underdetermined (i.e., too few), the system might generate too many potential memory returns. Subliminal editing then selects the most relevant or important memory, which is then entered into STM as a recall.
The passage mentions two major editors that facilitate this editing process, forming a cybernetic system. In this system, selected attributes from a current image within conscious awareness serve to inform and determine the next image that enters consciousness. In summarizing, the system works by taking a set of attributes in STM as cues to find related images in Long-Term Memory (LTM). The highest-priority recall from these retrieved images is selected and overwrites the fading contents within STM. This cycle repeats continuously, creating a dynamic and flowing stream of consciousness within STM.
Cue Editor 
What can happen is either (1) no recall or (2) excessive number of recalls. Everyone 
has experienced no recall, trying to remember something but being unable to do so. 
So you go about your business, but unknown to you, a search proceeds subliminally 
for what you are trying to remember. Cues keep cycling subconsciously, but are 
insuff i cient to return an image. However, when you least expect it, possibly at an 
inconvenient moment, the correct memory will pop into conscious STM with 
amazing clarity. This is an indication that the brain has worked in the background 
2Cybernetics was def i ned by Norbert Wiener (1894���1964), in his book of that title, as the study of 
control and communication in the animal and the machine. 
Introduction to a Memory-Based Brain System23 
without being noticed, adding or subtracting cues from a search until the cues are 
exactly right, as they must be for a recall. 
A cue editor helps resolve conf l icting cues (which would result in no matches in 
long-term associative memory). The term hit in the above i gure means that a return 
has occurred. But if hit is false, it is the task of the cue editor to modify the cues 
slightly so as to produce a return. As new images from the senses appear in STM, 
new rounds of cue editing are necessary. The past unf i nished editing process moves 
into the background but keeps working. This is why a person sometimes belatedly 
recalls a forgotten piece of information. A subsequent chapter goes into circuitry for 
a cue editor. 
A cue editor is not in a position to judge the priority of multiple returns. This is 
the task of a recall referee.
ChatGPT
The passage describes the function of a "cue editor" in the process of memory recall. The cue editor is involved when there's either no recall or an excessive number of recalls. When individuals attempt to remember something but can't, the cue editor works subliminally in the background, continuously adjusting and cycling through cues until the correct memory emerges into conscious Short-Term Memory (STM) with clarity.
The cue editor plays a pivotal role in resolving conflicting cues, which would otherwise result in no matches in the long-term associative memory. If there is a false "hit" or match, the cue editor modifies the cues slightly to ensure a successful recall. With each new sensory image appearing in STM, the cue editor engages in new rounds of editing. Unfinished editing processes from the past move to the background but continue to operate subliminally, explaining why individuals sometimes recall forgotten information after some delay.
However, it's important to note that the cue editor does not prioritize among multiple memory recalls. The task of determining the priority of various returns or recalled memories is assigned to another function referred to as a "recall referee". The specific mechanisms and circuitry involved in the cue editor will be discussed in detail in a subsequent chapter.
Recall Referee 
An underdetermined set of cues generally results in a plethora of returns (think of 
everything you know that contains the color green, for instance). This overabun- 
dance has to be processed to assess the priority of each. If something is critical, it 
must be passed quickly into STM, because survival may be involved. For instance, 
saferesponsesintheeventofdangermustbepromptlydirectedintoconsciousSTM. 
Fig. 2.2 Subliminal editors in relation to short- and long-term memories 
242Brain Architecture for an Intelligent Stream of Consciousness 
A technical term for what the recall referee must accomplish is multiple match 
resolution. Multiple match resolution avoids neural overload while assessing each 
return, calculating a priority value for each. Priorities are computed in parallel to 
speed the process of recall. The highest priority images are gated into conscious 
STM, giving a stream of consciousness one image at a time. 
Returns may occur many per second, so a lot of searching is possible subcon- 
sciously. They come forth in rapid succession and are parked in biological registers 
where calculations are accomplished. The priority computation will contain 
emotional factors, and survival factors, and others integrated into each word of 
LTM [5, 6]; these have been well discussed [7]. Priorities are compared. That image 
with the highest priority is gated into conscious STM to become one���s next thought. 
Recall editing is accomplished with a novel method of parallel processing 
using recursive neurons operating as controlled toggles. All this is discussed in 
subsequent chapters. 
The Nature of Decisions 
Decisions Based on Past Experience 
There is a theory that decisions are made not by free will in the sense of personal 
spur-of-the-moment choices, but by a search process that depends on past 
experiences and training. Often a ready-made decision is available based on past 
similar situations held in LTM, as for example when you are asked to donate to a 
cause that you do not like. A ���no��� answer is preprogrammed. Decisions, therefore, 
are affected by past experiences, what you did in similar situations, and whether or 
not an action supports your basic philosophy. 
Thereissomeevidencethatfreewillisanillusion[8,9].Electroencephalography 
concerningthetimingoff i ngermovements,publishedbyBenjaminLibitandothers, 
indicates that choices are made in the brain without knowledge by the person 
involved; decisions were made well before a person realized it. Surprisingly, the 
brain seems to be in control, making decisions, and eventually informingconscious- 
ness. It is not the other way around, in which a ���person��� makes a conscious decision 
(without the aid of his or her brain), and then informs the brain. 
Decisions with a Random Variable
ChatGPT
The "Recall Referee" is introduced as a mechanism dealing with underdetermined sets of cues that yield numerous returns (recalls). When there's an abundance of returns, the Recall Referee processes them to assess each one���s priority. Priority is vital for the speed of transition into Short-Term Memory (STM), especially when the information is crucial for survival, as in responding to danger.
The process called "multiple match resolution" performed by the Recall Referee prevents neural overload by calculating a priority value for each return. This calculation is conducted in parallel to expedite recall. The returns, potentially occurring many times per second, are sequentially placed into biological registers, where their priority is computed considering various factors, including emotional and survival aspects integrated into each word in Long-Term Memory (LTM). The image (or recall) with the highest priority then gets moved into conscious STM, becoming the next thought in the stream of consciousness.
The passage also touches on decision-making, theorizing that decisions aren't necessarily products of free will but result from a search process grounded in past experiences and training. This theory suggests that people often have preprogrammed responses based on past experiences stored in LTM. It even mentions evidence proposing that free will might be an illusion, citing studies using electroencephalography (EEG) showing that decision-making processes in the brain occur before individuals become consciously aware of making a decision. This indicates that the brain autonomously makes decisions and subsequently informs consciousness, challenging traditional notions of free will and conscious decision-making.
Chapter 3 
Circuit Elements Required for Neural Systems 
Introduction 
Circuit elements introduced in this chapter are (1) short-term memory (STM) 
neuron, (2) regular synaptic contact, (3) weak synaptic contact, (4) postsynaptic 
capacitor with initial charge representing long-term potentiation (LTP), (5) capaci- 
tive termination for dendrites, (6) dendritic AND, OR logic, (7) dendritic XOR, 
NOT logic, (8) enabled, or soma AND, OR logic, and (9) enabled, or soma NOT 
logic. Also available are delay and sundry other elements. Some of these are novel 
in traditional circuits and systems, which has always been aimed at solid-state 
circuitry, but these nine elements are essential when modeling pulsating neurons. 
The functions of these nine elements are demonstrated by a set of simulation 
experiments in the appendix. 
Classical elements are also useful, such as capacitance, resistance, independent 
voltage sources and current sources, and controlled sources controlled by circuit 
variables (voltages and currents). Circuit elements as above are required to 
(1) serve to model neural behavior in an accurate way and (2) satisfy the needs of 
a functioning brain system. 
Models as in this chapter summarize experimental data; they serve to inspire 
future experiments, and hopefully encourage understanding. Models, of course, 
must be routinely updated to ref l ect new experimental data. Models sometimes lead 
to practical versions of the modeled system, as they have done for artif i cial neural 
networks, but students are well advised to seek full comprehension before 
attempting engineering applications.

Introducing...The Active Neuron 
The neuron or at least a model of one will now be introduced. The brain contains a 
great manyneurons, estimated tobe 100billion more or less (1 billion �� 109). 
With 
this many, it is only natural that some neurons will differ from others not only in 
shape but also in makeup and function. 
What is known about neurons follows from a combination of measurements in 
the laboratory and from computerized simulations using realistic physical 
parameters. It is found that neurons can be triggered to give pulses between about 
?70 and +40 mV; each pulse is roughly 2 ms wide; these propagate back and forth 
along dendrites, and down the axon to boutons, also known as terminations or tips. 
Subsequently in the presynaptic region of a synapse, these boutons release 
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters, like any larger mole- 
cule, can be ionized, which makes them more effective in making their presence 
felt. They strongly impact a postsynaptic region. 
In order to activate a neural burst, there needs to be a force that triggers 
molecules in the membrane. Excitatory neurotransmitter ions are one way to 
accomplish triggering in a receptor, usually on a spine located on a (basal or apical) 
dendrite. These in turn connect to the soma (or body) of a neuron. Note that spines

Chapter 3 introduces various circuit elements essential for modeling pulsating neurons and neural systems, providing a framework for understanding neural behavior and serving the functional needs of a brain system. These circuit elements include:
Short-Term Memory (STM) neuron
Regular synaptic contact
Weak synaptic contact
Postsynaptic capacitor with initial charge (representing Long-Term Potentiation or LTP)
Capacitive termination for dendrites
Dendritic AND, OR logic
Dendritic XOR, NOT logic
Enabled (soma) AND, OR logic
Enabled (soma) NOT logic
Alongside these, the chapter mentions delay and various other elements. Some of the elements listed are novel in the context of traditional circuits and systems, which primarily focus on solid-state circuitry. Simulation experiments demonstrating the functions of these nine elements can be found in the appendix of the chapter.
In addition to these specific neural circuit elements, classical elements like capacitance, resistance, independent and controlled voltage and current sources are also valuable. The chapter's models, summarizing experimental data, are designed to inspire future experiments and foster understanding. However, these models should be updated routinely to reflect new experimental data and insights.
The chapter proceeds to introduce the "active neuron," highlighting that the brain's estimated 100 billion neurons vary in shape, makeup, and function. Information about neurons is derived from laboratory measurements and computerized simulations with realistic physical parameters. Neurons can produce pulses ranging between approximately -70 and +40 mV, with each pulse being around 2 ms wide. These pulses propagate along dendrites and down axons to boutons (terminations or tips), where neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters, which can be ionized, play a crucial role in affecting the postsynaptic region, initiating neural activity and engaging with receptors on dendritic spines connected to the neuron's soma (body). The introduction ends here, likely to be followed by further details and discussion in subsequent sections of the chapter.
Having a weak synapse is one way to achieve a single pulse. An equivalent way 
is to employ a neural circuit to provide a single pulse is given in Fig. 3.11. This 
circuit prevents the transmission of pulses beyond the i rst pulse. 
The i gure shows XOR logic (XOR logic is discussed below) to prevent any 
pulses after the i rst pulse. In the XOR, pulses applied to one input pass through, but 
simultaneous pulses at both inputs result in no output. The i rst pulse triggers a STM 
neuron STM1 whose several output pulses are timed to balance each additional 
pulse in the burst to prevent the transmission of pulses beyond the i rst. Other less 
tricky methods of producing a single pulse are possible using enabled AND and 
NOT gates, described below, which makes pulse timing less critical (the design of a 
circuit is left as a exercise). The label Pulse(1) means exactly one pulse. 
Long-Term Potentiation 
This refers to aphenomenon longthought tobe important tolearning, under which a 
previously triggered synaptic system becomes easier to trigger in the future [3]. One 
intuitive explanation is that a presynaptic vesicle delivers a limited count of excit- 
atoryneurotransmittersthattriggerareceptorwithLTP,butthattheconf i gurationof 
the postsynaptic receptoris such that it cannot be triggeredwithout LTP. Thatis, the 
neuronresponds to the limited count of excitatoryneurotransmitters only ifLTP has 
beencreatedbeforehand.LTPmaybecreatedbyasignalsuchasanovervoltagethat 
changes the chemistry of the receptor���s membrane, causing it to be more sensitive 
than otherwise it would be without LTP. Without LTP, triggering would require a 
full bundle of excitatory neurotransmitters. 
LTP Circuit Model 
LTP can be modeled in circuit terms as trapped static charge that has been 
permanently placed into the membrane capacitance of a receptor. The receptor 
with LTP must be able to be queried, so the connecting synapse is modeled as a 
regular synapse as above, that is, a transconductance amplif i er that transmits one 
packet of charge for each voltage pulse applied to its input.

Trapped static charge across the membrane capacitance of a postsynaptic recep- 
tor is equivalent to an initial voltage across the capacitor as depicted in Fig. 3.12. 
Receptor geometry and parameters are assumed to be such that membrane capaci- 
tance is a little larger, so that without LTP it cannot be triggered by a single pulse. 
But with LTP a single pulse is able to trigger the receptor. LTP makes a receptor 
easier to trigger because not as much additional charge is required to build up 
capacitive voltage to a threshold for triggering. 
For example, the neural gate in the i gure can be triggered by a single pulse from 
a weak synapse, instead of the usual burst of several pulses. That is, the capacitance 
value is such that without LTP, activation would require several pulses, but with 
LTP it only requires one pulse.

Circuit Elements for Back Propagation and Charge Storage 
When a smaller diameter dendrite physically connects to a larger diameter dendrite 
or soma, there is added membrane capacitance as suggested by the symbol in 
Fig. 3.13. The higher membrane capacitance C can integrate the charges being 
delivered by impinging pulses and thus can accumulate voltage. When incoming 
pulses have charged the capacitance suff i ciently, its voltage reaches a threshold that 
triggers an action potential in the larger body.
ChatGPT
The passage begins by explaining how a weak synapse or a specific neural circuit (as shown in Fig. 3.11) can be used to achieve a single pulse. The circuit, utilizing XOR logic, prevents the transmission of pulses beyond the first one. The XOR logic allows the first pulse to pass through but inhibits output when simultaneous pulses are detected at both inputs. The first pulse triggers an STM neuron (STM1), and its output pulses are timed to prevent the transmission of any pulses beyond the first one. Other methods to produce a single pulse are also possible, and readers are prompted to design circuits using enabled AND and NOT gates as an exercise.
The passage then discusses Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a phenomenon crucial for learning. LTP makes previously triggered synaptic systems easier to trigger in the future. An intuitive explanation provided is that a presynaptic vesicle delivers limited excitatory neurotransmitters that can only trigger a receptor with LTP. LTP is described as being created by signals like overvoltage, which alters the receptor's membrane chemistry, making it more sensitive and responsive to excitatory neurotransmitters.
The LTP Circuit Model is introduced, depicting LTP as trapped static charge permanently located in the membrane capacitance of a receptor. This charge makes the receptor easier to trigger because less additional charge is needed to reach the threshold for triggering. The passage gives an example where a receptor with LTP can be triggered by a single pulse from a weak synapse instead of requiring multiple pulses. This trapped charge does not easily leak away, and mechanisms maintaining this trapped charge are implicit in the model. LTP is suggested to play a role in long-term memory, although it isn't the only proposed mechanism for it.
Finally, the passage mentions circuit elements necessary for back propagation and charge storage. When a smaller diameter dendrite connects to a larger one or to a soma, additional membrane capacitance is introduced, allowing for the accumulation of voltage through incoming pulses. When the voltage reaches a threshold, an action potential is triggered in the larger body.

Abstract
The neuromatrix theory of pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic "neurosignature" patterns of nerve impulses generated by a widely distributed neural network-the "body-self neuromatrix"-in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but they may also be generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The neuromatrix theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output patterns of the body-self neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix

The Neuromatrix Theory of Pain, proposed by R. Melzack, suggests that pain is not directly caused by injury, inflammation, or other pathologies but is a multidimensional experience generated by characteristic "neurosignature" patterns of nerve impulses. These impulses are produced by a neural network in the brain known as the "body-self neuromatrix."
Key points from the abstract:
Multidimensional Experience
: Pain is understood as a complex experience, not merely a direct response to injury or inflammation.
Neurosignature Patterns
: These are distinctive patterns of nerve impulses generated by the body-self neuromatrix in the brain, contributing to the experience of pain.
Independently Generated Patterns
: While these neurosignature patterns can be triggered by sensory inputs (like injury), they can also be generated independently, explaining why pain is sometimes felt in the absence of clear physical harm.
Chronic Pain Mystery
: Acute pains resulting from brief harmful stimuli are well-understood, but chronic pain syndromes���often severe pain without clear injury or pathology���remain mysterious and poorly understood.
Stress and Pain Connection
: The relationship between chronic psychological or physical stress and chronic pain is acknowledged but not well understood. Chronic stress is often associated with chronic pain.
Output Patterns
: The output patterns of the neuromatrix are said to activate various perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. These output patterns are crucial in the generation of the pain experience.
Genetic and Sensory Influence
: The neuromatrix is genetically determined but also modified by sensory experiences. The output pattern of the neuromatrix, responsible for generating pain, is influenced by various factors, with somatic sensory input being only one component. Multiple influences converge on the neuromatrix to determine its output pattern.
This theory provides a framework to understand pain not merely as a sensation resulting from physical stimuli but as a complex perceptual experience influenced by various factors and generated by the brain���s neural networks.
I haven't read the article yet, but it makes me think of phantom limbs, fibromyalgia, psychological pain, empathy modeling, and the two factor theory of emotions.
ChatGPT
Your thoughts are quite insightful, as the Neuromatrix Theory of Pain does indeed have implications and connections to various phenomena and theories:
Phantom Limbs
: Phantom limb pain is a classic example supporting the Neuromatrix Theory. Individuals can experience pain in limbs that are no longer present, suggesting that pain is not solely due to peripheral input but is also generated by neural networks in the brain.
Fibromyalgia
: Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain without clear pathological findings. The Neuromatrix Theory helps explain how pain perception in conditions like fibromyalgia might be generated or amplified by the brain itself, not necessarily correlating with tissue damage or inflammation.
Psychological Pain
: Psychological pain, or emotional pain, can also be understood through this lens, where the neural networks responsible for pain perception are activated without physical harm, perhaps due to stress, trauma, or mental health disorders.
Empathy Modeling
: Understanding pain as a brain-generated experience can aid in developing empathy for others��� pain, whether physical or psychological. This perspective might assist clinicians, caregivers, and individuals in acknowledging and validating others��� pain experiences, even in the absence of visible or measurable physical symptoms.
Two-Factor Theory of Emotions
: The Two-Factor Theory of Emotion posits that emotions are a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation. In the context of pain, the physiological arousal (pain sensation) might not solely depend on physical stimuli, and the cognitive interpretation (pain perception) plays a crucial role in the overall experience of pain.
Connecting the Neuromatrix Theory with these topics provides a comprehensive view of pain as a complex, multifaceted experience rather than a simple, direct response to physical stimuli. Understanding these connections may offer new insights and approaches for treating various pain-related conditions and enhancing empathy and care for individuals experiencing pain.
Pain has many valuable functions. It often sig-nals injury or disease and produces a widerange of actions to stop it and treat its causes.Toothache, for example, is usually a signal of caries,and forces us to seek dental help. Memories of ear-lier pain and suffering also warn us to avoid poten-tially dangerous situations. Yet another effect of pain,especially after serious injury or disease, is to makeus rest, thereby promoting the body���s healing pro-cesses. All of these actions induced by pain���to seekhelp, avoid, or rest���have obvious value for survival.Yet despite these valuable features of pain, thereare negative aspects that challenge our attempts tounderstand the puzzle of pain. What is the value ofpersistent phantom limb pain to amputees whosestump has healed completely? The pain, not the physi-cal disability, prevents them from leading normallives. Similarly, most backaches, headaches, musclepains, nerve pains, pelvic pains, and facial pains serveno discernible purpose, are difficult to treat, and area disaster for the people who suffer them.1,2Pain may be the warning signal that saves thelives of some people, but it destroys the lives of count-less others. Chronic pains, clearly, are not a warningto prevent physical injury or disease. They are thedisease���the result of neural mechanisms gone awry.The neuromatrix concept suggests brain mechanismsthat may underlie some kinds of chronic pain andpoints to new forms of treatment.Phantom Limbs and theConcept of a NeuromatrixThe gate control theory of pain,3 proposed in1965, highlighted the role of spinal and brain mecha-nisms in acute and chronic pain, and triggered anexplosive advance in pain research and therapy. Yet,as historians of science have pointed out, good theo-ries are instrumental in producing facts that eventu-ally require a new theory to incorporate them. Andthis is what has happened. It is possible to make ad-justments to the gate theory so that, for example, itincludes long-lasting activity of the sort Wall4 hasdescribed. But there is a set of observations on painin paraplegics that just does not fit the theory. Thisdoes not negate the gate theory, of course. Periph-eral and spinal processes are obviously an importantpart of pain, and we need to know more about themechanisms of peripheral inflammation, spinalmodulation, midbrain descending control, and soforth. But the data on painful phantoms below thelevel of total spinal section5 indicate that we need togo beyond the foramen magnum and into the brain.6,7Now let me make it clear that I mean more thanjust the sensory thalamus and cortex. These are im-portant, of course, but they mark just the beginningof the neural activities that underlie perception. TheDecember 2001���Journal of Dental Education1379cortex, White and Sweet8 have made amply clear, isnot the pain center, and neither is the thalamus.9 Theareas of the brain involved in pain experience andbehavior are very extensive. They must include thelimbic system as well as somatosensory projections.Furthermore, because our body perceptions includevisual and vestibular mechanisms as well as cogni-tive processes, widespread areas of the brain mustbe involved in pain. Yet the plain fact is that we donot have an adequate theory of how the brain works.My analysis of phantom limb phenomena6,7 hasled to four conclusions that point to a new concep-tual nervous system. First, because the phantom limb(or other body part) feels so real, it is reasonable toconclude that the body we normally feel is subservedby the same neural processes in the brain; these brainprocesses are normally activated and modulated byinputs from the body, but they can act in the absenceof any inputs. Second, all the qualities we normallyfeel from the body, including pain, are also felt inthe absence of inputs from the body; from this wemay conclude that the origins of the patterns thatunderlie the qualities of experience lie in neural net-works in the brain; stimuli may trigger the patternsbut do not produce them. Third, the body is perceivedas a unity and is identified as the ���self,��� distinct fromother people and the surrounding world. The experi-ence of a unity of such diverse feelings, includingthe self as the point of orientation in the surroundingenvironment, is produced by central neural processesand cannot derive from the peripheral nervous sys-tem or spinal cord. Fourth, the brain processes thatunderlie the body-self are, to an important extent thatcan no longer be ignored, ���built-in��� by genetic speci-fication, although this built-in substrate must, ofcourse, be modified by experience. These conclu-sions provide the basis of the new conceptual model
ChatGPT
Your provided text emphasizes the dichotomy between the adaptive, protective functions of pain and the maladaptive, debilitating experience of chronic or phantom pain. It reiterates that while acute pain often serves a vital protective and warning function, chronic and phantom pains do not offer such benefits and instead significantly impair individuals��� quality of life.
Key Points:
Value of Pain:
Acute pain signals injury or disease, prompting individuals to seek treatment.
Pain memories act as deterrents against potentially harmful situations.
Pain promotes rest and healing after significant injuries or diseases.
Negative Aspects:
Phantom limb pain, headaches, backaches, and various chronic pain types often have no discernible protective purpose and are debilitating.
Phantom Limbs and Neuromatrix Concept:
The text introduces the "neuromatrix" concept to help understand chronic and phantom pains. This concept suggests that widespread areas in the brain are involved in the perception and experience of pain.
Phantom limb phenomena highlight that the body's perception, including pain, originates in the brain, not just from peripheral inputs. The brain can generate sensations of pain even in the absence of external stimuli.
The body-self perception, including the sensation of unity and identification of the "self," is seen as a product of central neural processes.
The neural networks in the brain contributing to body-self perception and pain are believed to be genetically determined to some extent but are also modifiable through experience.
Implications:
Understanding the neuromatrix concept can be pivotal for developing new approaches and treatments for chronic pain conditions. This perspective views chronic pain not just as a symptom but as a disease in itself, arising from neural mechanisms that have gone awry.
The neuromatrix concept suggests that pain, as a subjective experience, is generated by characteristic patterns of nerve impulses in the brain, which may or may not be triggered by external stimuli.
This theory offers a framework for understanding how pain can exist in the absence of injury or tissue damage, as seen in chronic pain syndromes, phantom limb pain, and other pain disorders.
Conclusion:
This new conceptual model provides a basis for understanding the multifaceted nature of pain, considering both its protective and maladaptive manifestations. Acknowledging the brain���s central role in generating and modulating pain can pave the way for innovative therapeutic interventions and pain management strategies that address the underlying neural mechanisms rather than focusing solely on peripheral symptoms.
Outline of the Theory 
The anatomical substrate of the body-self, I 
propose, is a large, widespread network of neurons 
that consists of loops between the thalamus and cor- 
tex as well as between the cortex and limbic system. 
I have labeled the entire network, whose spatial dis- 
tribution and synaptic links are initially determined 
genetically and are later sculpted by sensory inputs, 
as a neuromatrix. The loops diverge to permit paral- 
lel processing in different components of the 
neuromatrix and converge repeatedly to permit in- 
teractions between the output products of process- 
ing. The repeated cyclical processing and synthesis 
of nerve impulses through the neuromatrix imparts 
a characteristic pattern: the neurosignature. The 
neurosignature of the neuromatrix is imparted on all 
nerve impulse patterns that flow through it; the 
neurosignature is produced by the patterns of synap- 
tic connections in the entire neuromatrix. All inputs 
from the body undergo cyclical processing and syn- 
thesis so that characteristic patterns are impressed 
on them in the neuromatrix. Portions of the 
neuromatrix are specialized to process information 
related to major sensory events (such as injury, tem- 
perature change, and stimulation of erogenous tis- 
sue) and may be labeled as neuromodules that im- 
press subsignatures on the larger neurosignature. 
The neurosignature, which is a continuous out- 
flow from the body-self neuromatrix, is projected to 
areas in the brain���the sentient neural hub���in which 
the stream of nerve impulses (the neurosignature 
modulated by ongoing inputs) is converted into a 
continually changing stream of awareness. Further- 
more, the neurosignature patterns may also activate 
neural networks to produce movement. That is, the 
patterns bifurcate, so that a pattern proceeds to the 
sentient neural hub (where the pattern is converted 
into the experience of movement), and a similar pat- 
tern proceeds through neural networks that eventu- 
ally activate spinal cord neurons to produce muscle 
patterns for complex actions. 
The four components of the new conceptual 
nervous system, then, are 1) the body-self 
neuromatrix; 2) cyclical processing and synthesis in 
which the neurosignature is produced; 3) the sen- 
tient neural hub, which converts (transduces) the flow 
of neurosignatures into the flow of awareness; and 
4) activation of an action neuromatrix to provide the 
pattern of movements to bring about the desired goal.

The Body-Self Neuromatrix 
The body is felt as a unity, with different 
qualities at different times and, I believe, the brain 
mechanism that underlies the experience also com- 
prises a unified system that acts as a whole and pro- 
duces a neurosignature pattern of a whole body. The 
conceptualization of this unified brain mechanism 
lies at the heart of the new theory, and I believe the 
word ���neuromatrix��� best characterizes it. ���Matrix��� 
has several definitions in Webster���s dictionary, and some of them imply precisely the properties of the 
neuromatrix as I conceive of it. First, a matrix is de- 
fined as ���something within which something else 
originates, takes form, or develops.��� This is exactly 
what I wish to imply: the neuromatrix (not the stimu- 
lus, peripheral nerves, or ���brain center���) is the ori- 
gin of the neurosignature; the neurosignature origi- 
nates and takes form in the neuromatrix. Although 
the neurosignature may be triggered or modulated 
by input, the input is only a ���trigger��� and does not 
produce the neurosignature itself. Matrix is also de- 
fined as a ���mold��� or ���die��� that leaves an imprint on 
something else. In this sense, the neuromatrix ���casts��� 
its distinctive signature on all inputs (nerve impulse 
patterns) that flow through it. Finally, matrix is de- 
fined as ���an array of circuit elements . . . for per- 
forming a specific function as interconnected.��� The 
array of neurons in a neuromatrix, I propose, is ge- 
netically programmed to perform the specific func- 
tion of producing the signature pattern. The final, 
integrated neurosignature pattern for the body-self 
ultimately produces awareness and action. 
For these reasons, the term neuromatrix seems 
to be appropriate. The neuromatrix, distributed 
throughout many areas of the brain, comprises a 
widespread network of neurons that generates pat- 
terns, processes information that flows through it, 
and ultimately produces the pattern that is felt as a 
whole body possessing a sense of self. The stream of 
neurosignature output with constantly varying pat- 
terns riding on the main signature pattern produces 
the feelings of the body-self with constantly chang- 
ing perceptual and emotional qualities.
ChatGPT
The Body-Self Neuromatrix
I. Definition and Concept
The Body-Self Neuromatrix is conceived as a unified brain mechanism responsible for producing the neurosignature pattern that characterizes the whole body.
The term ���neuromatrix��� is chosen due to its implication of being a foundational structure from which something originates, develops, or takes form.
II. Properties of the Neuromatrix
Originator:
The neuromatrix is the source of the neurosignature, not merely a conduit for external stimuli or inputs. While inputs may trigger or modulate the neurosignature, they do not create it.
Imprinter:
The neuromatrix casts its distinct neurosignature on all nerve impulse patterns passing through it, serving as a mold or imprinting device.
Functional Array:
Comprising an array of interconnected circuit elements (neurons), the neuromatrix is designed to perform a specific function���producing a signature pattern. This is believed to be genetically programmed.
III. Functionality and Distribution
The neuromatrix is distributed across various brain areas, forming a comprehensive network of neurons that not only generates and processes patterns but is also integral to the perception of the body-self as a unified whole.
It generates a continuous stream of neurosignature output, with varying patterns superimposed on the principal signature. This dynamic output is responsible for the ever-changing perceptions and emotions associated with the body-self.
IV. Significance
The term "neuromatrix" aptly encapsulates the system's role and functionality in producing awareness and guiding actions, serving as the underlying mechanism for the perception of a coherent and continuous sense of self within the body.
The neuromatrix theory provides a framework for understanding how the brain generates the continuous and unified experience of the body and self, emphasizing the importance of internal neural mechanisms over external stimuli in shaping our perceptions and experiences.
The gate control theory of pain asserts that non-painful input closes the nerve "gates" to painful input, which prevents pain sensation from traveling to the central nervous system.


In the top panel, the nonnociceptive, large-diameter sensory fiber (orange) is more active than the nociceptive small-diameter fiber (blue), therefore the net input to the inhibitory interneuron (red) is net positive. The inhibitory interneuron provides presynaptic inhibition to both the nociceptive and nonnociceptive neurons, reducing the excitation of the transmission cells. In the bottom panel, an open "gate" (free-flowing information from afferents to the transmission cells) is pictured. This occurs when there is more activity in the nociceptive small-diameter fibers (blue) than the nonnociceptive large-diameter fibers (orange). In this situation, the inhibitory interneuron is silenced, which relieves inhibition of the transmission cells. This "open gate" allows for transmission cells to be excited, and thus pain to be sensed.
The gate control theory of pain describes how non-painful sensations can override and reduce painful sensations. A painful, nociceptive stimulus stimulates primary afferent fibers and travels to the brain via transmission cells. Increasing activity of the transmission cells results in increased perceived pain. Conversely, decreasing activity of transmission cells reduces perceived pain. In the gate control theory, a closed "gate" describes when input to transmission cells is blocked, therefore reducing the sensation of pain. An open ���gate��� describes when input to transmission cells is permitted, therefore allowing the sensation of pain.

First proposed in 1965 by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall, the theory offers a physiological explanation for the previously observed effect of psychology on pain perception. Combining early concepts derived from the specificity theory and the peripheral pattern theory, the gate control theory is considered to be one of the most influential theories of pain. This theory provided a neural basis which reconciled the specificity and pattern theories -- and ultimately revolutionized pain research.[1]

Although there are some important observations that the gate control theory cannot explain adequately[which?], this theory remains the theory of pain which most accurately accounts for the physical and psychological aspects of pain perception.[2]

Willem Noordenbos (1910���1990), a Dutch researcher at the University of Amsterdam, proposed in 1959 a model which featured interaction between small (unmyelinated) and thick (myelinated) fibers. In this model, the fast (myelinated) fibers block the slow (unmyelinated) fibers: "fast blocks slow".[3]
ChatGPT
Gate Control Theory of Pain: Overview
I. Basic Concept
The theory suggests that non-painful input can close ���gates��� to painful input, preventing pain sensation from traveling to the central nervous system.
II. Mechanism
Top Panel Scenario:
When the large-diameter, non-nociceptive sensory fiber (non-painful) is more active than the small-diameter, nociceptive fiber (painful), there is a net positive input to the inhibitory interneuron. This leads to presynaptic inhibition of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons, reducing the activation of transmission cells.
Bottom Panel Scenario:
When there���s more activity in the nociceptive fibers, the inhibitory interneuron is silent, leading to a reduction in inhibition of the transmission cells. This scenario is described as an ���open gate,��� allowing transmission cells to be excited and pain to be sensed.
III. Gate Control
A "closed gate" blocks input to transmission cells, reducing pain sensation. In contrast, an "open gate" allows input to transmission cells, permitting pain sensation.
IV. Historical Background
Proposed in 1965 by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall.
The theory was a physiological explanation for the observed effect of psychology on pain perception.
It integrated concepts from both specificity theory and peripheral pattern theory, revolutionizing pain research in the process.
V. Significance
Despite its limitations, the gate control theory is considered one of the most influential and accurate theories in accounting for both physical and psychological aspects of pain perception.
The theory provided a foundational neural basis reconciling the specificity and pattern theories.
VI. Predecessor Theories
In 1959, Willem Noordenbos proposed a model featuring interaction between small (unmyelinated) and large (myelinated) fibers, where fast, myelinated fibers block slow, unmyelinated fibers.
Critical Insights:
The gate control theory provided a transformative perspective on pain, emphasizing the interaction between psychological and physiological factors in pain perception.
While it may not perfectly explain all aspects of pain perception, its integrative approach and foundational concepts have significantly influenced subsequent research and understanding in the field of pain study.
Tactile induced analgesia
ChatGPT
Tactile-induced analgesia refers to the phenomenon where tactile stimulation, such as rubbing, massaging, or applying pressure to an area of the body, results in a reduction or relief of pain in that area or in a nearby area. The underlying mechanisms are still under investigation, but several hypotheses and principles may help explain this phenomenon:
Mechanisms:
Gate Control Theory:
As discussed earlier, the gate control theory of pain suggests that non-painful stimuli can inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli. In this context, tactile stimulation acts as the non-painful stimuli that "close the gate" to pain signals, reducing the perception of pain.
Endorphin Release:
Tactile stimulation, especially through massage or similar manipulations, may lead to the release of endorphins. Endorphins are the body's natural painkillers, and their release can lead to a sensation of relief and pleasure, counteracting pain signals.
Descending Inhibitory Pathways:
The body possesses a system of descending inhibitory pathways that modulate pain transmission. Through tactile stimulation, these pathways can be activated, leading to the suppression of pain signals at the spinal cord level.
Sensory Discrimination:
The brain may prioritize the processing of tactile stimuli over painful stimuli, thus diluting the perception of pain. This principle is often utilized in pain management practices where the focus is shifted from pain to other sensory experiences.
Psychological Factors:
Psychological factors like attention, expectation, and overall mood play significant roles in pain perception. Tactile stimulation may divert attention from pain, induce relaxation, and create positive expectations, which collectively contribute to analgesia.
Applications:
Pain Management:
Used as a non-pharmacological method for pain relief in various conditions, including chronic pain, postoperative pain, and labor pain.
Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation:
Integrated into therapy plans to improve mobility and reduce discomfort in patients recovering from injuries or surgeries.
Sports Medicine:
Employed to manage pain and accelerate recovery in athletes.
Limitations:
While tactile-induced analgesia can be effective, its efficacy varies from individual to individual, and it may not provide sufficient relief for severe or chronic pain without additional interventions.
Understanding tactile-induced analgesia���s mechanisms and applications is crucial for healthcare professionals in various fields, including pain management, physical therapy, and sports medicine, as it offers an alternative or supplementary method for relieving pain without relying solely on medication.
The Gate Control Theory of Pain, first proposed in the 1960s by Melzack and Wall, states that the concurrent activation of tactile afferent nerve fibers inhibits activation of nociceptive afferent fibres.[1] Melzack and Wall suggested that a gating mechanism is present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. They suggested that both touch and pain afferent fibres synapse on to 'projection cells' and inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. It is the projection cells which then travel up the spinothalamic tract to the brain. Interactions between these connections is thought to mediate the perception of painful stimuli:

With no input, the inhibitory interneuron stops signals being sent to the brain from the projection neuron, i.e. the gate is closed.
Stimulation of large tactile afferents leads to somatosensory input. The inhibitory interneuron and projection neuron are both activated, but the inhibitory interneuron stops signals travelling to the brain via the projection neuron, i.e. the gate is closed.
Nociception occurs if there is greater stimulation of the smaller pain afferents. The interneuron becomes inactivated, so that the projection neuron can send signals to the brain leading to pain perception, i.e. the gate is open.
The theory shows that rubbing a painful site leads to stimulation of somatosensory input to projector neurons, which reduces the intensity of pain perceived.

Development of the Gate Control Theory
Edit
More recently neurophysiological studies in animals have indicated that the wide range dynamic neurons (WDR neurons) in the dorsal horn are the homologue of Wall and Melzack's proposed projector neurons and inhibitory interneurons.[2] The neurons are multimodal (respond to both touch and pain input), with an inhibitory surround receptive field. Experiments looking at the WDR neurons in animals have shown that a strong tactile stimulus in the peripheral inhibitory field could reduce the response to a painful stimulus to the same extent as a weak tactile stimulus closer to the centre of the receptive field.[3][4] These data show the Gate Control Theory of Pain was correct in the prediction that activation of large tactile afferent fibres inhibit the nociceptive afferent signal being transmitted to the brain.
ChatGPT
Your provided text describes the Gate Control Theory of Pain in depth, outlining the mechanism of action as initially proposed by Melzack and Wall. Below is a summarized explanation of the text:
Summary of the Gate Control Theory of Pain:
Foundational Concept:
The theory, proposed in the 1960s by Melzack and Wall, suggests a "gating mechanism" in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It stipulates that tactile and pain afferent fibers interact with 'projection cells' and inhibitory interneurons, influencing pain perception.
Mechanism:
No Input:
The inhibitory interneuron blocks signals from the projection neuron to the brain, closing the gate.
Tactile Input:
Both inhibitory interneuron and projection neuron are activated during tactile stimulation. The inhibitory interneuron suppresses signals to the brain from the projection neuron, keeping the gate closed.
Pain Input (Nociception):
Greater stimulation of pain afferents inactivates the inhibitory interneuron, allowing the projection neuron to send signals to the brain, leading to pain perception. In this scenario, the gate is open.
Practical Implication:
Rubbing a painful area stimulates somatosensory input, which reduces the perception of pain due to the activation of the gate control mechanism.
Developments:
Wide Range Dynamic Neurons (WDR Neurons):
Recent studies have identified WDR neurons in the dorsal horn as likely counterparts to the proposed projector neurons and inhibitory interneurons. These neurons are multimodal, responding to both touch and pain inputs.
WDR neurons possess an inhibitory surround receptive field. Experimental data indicate that strong peripheral tactile stimulation can reduce the response to painful stimuli similarly to weak tactile stimuli near the receptive field's center.
These findings support the Gate Control Theory's accuracy, showing that activating large tactile afferent fibers indeed inhibits nociceptive signals transmitted to the brain.
Conclusion:
The Gate Control Theory of Pain provides a foundational understanding of pain modulation in the nervous system, explaining how tactile stimuli can influence pain perception. Recent discoveries and experimental data continue to validate and expand upon this theory, deepening our understanding of pain mechanisms and providing pathways for potential therapeutic interventions.

The newest additions:

Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is the salinity gradient energy retrieved from the difference in the salt concentration between seawater and river water.[1] A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. Sidney Loeb in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. --United States Patent US4171409

In reverse electrodialysis a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. The process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.[2]

In RED, as in a fuel cell, the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250 kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the Netherlands, for example, more than 3,300 m3 fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135 meters. The energy potential is therefore e=mg��h=3.3*106 kg/s*10 m/s2*135 meters ca.= 4.5*109 Joule per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts

And hydrous pyrolysis (HP) is a thermal depolymerization process used to convert wet biomass, and other macromolecules, into crude-like oil under moderate temperature and high pressure.[1] The crude-like oil has high energy density with a lower heating value of 33.8-36.9 MJ/kg and 5-20 wt% oxygen and renewable chemicals.[2][3] The process has also been called Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL).

I guess we should once again mention the polar nuclear powered geothermal refrigerators, Septentrion and Meridion.  I think they are better than some of these other solutions:


What could we do to cool the Arctic, specifically?
Published: August 17, 2022 12.49pm EDT
 Shaun Fitzgerald, Hugh Hunt, University of Cambridge
The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, and in some areas as much as seven times. That���s according to new research by a group of Norwegian scientists. This effect, dubbed ���Arctic amplification���, is well documented, though the new study finds the region is warming even faster than previously thought.

One of the reasons is the loss of ice cover over the sea in the Arctic. Exposed ocean water absorbs more radiation from the sun than white ice. So, as ice cover diminishes then the rate of warming increases. This is what climate scientists call a positive feedback loop, sometimes referred to as a tipping point.

Changes in the Arctic can have massive and outsized impacts on other parts of the world. Greenland���s melting ice sheet could raise sea levels, for instance, while ocean circulation currents can be changed which in turn affect weather patterns elsewhere.

An obvious question then is whether there is any way we can halt the warming specifically in the Arctic? Fortunately, there are potential avenues for us to pursue, even if they are all unproven in practice than Fill the skies with tiny particles
The first idea would be to release material such as sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere which would cause small particles to form that would reflect more of the sun���s energy back into space. With less solar radiation entering the lower parts of the atmosphere, the ground below would cool down. This process is known as stratospheric aerosol injection.

The concept has been studied for some time and is similar to what happens when a large volcano erupts. For instance the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines released about 20 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide and ash particles, and cooled the planet by about 0.5��� for a year (for context, that temporarily erased about half of the global warming since pre-industrial times).

Large volcanic cloud
Climate cooler: Pinatubo erupts in June 1991. Dave Harlow / US Geological Survey
Cooling the Earth with this method would involve getting sulphur dioxide up into the stratosphere at low latitudes. The material would then get distributed around the world by winds and gradually migrate towards the pole in the hemisphere into which it was released, thereby providing a reflective shield. If the release was applied to low latitudes in both hemispheres, then it would cool the whole Earth.

However, if we wanted to just cool the Arctic then the particles could be released closer to the region. The stratosphere also begins much lower down (about 9km at the North Pole compared to 17km at the equator) so planes wouldn���t have to fly so high.

Brighten the clouds
The second idea involves ���brightening��� clouds over the ocean in order to, again, reflect more of the sun���s energy back into space. This is derived from the observation that under certain conditions, particles ejected from the funnels of ships cause clouds to form over the ocean.

Map of Atlantic with clouds

Over land, there is plenty of dust and other tiny particles for clouds to first form around, but over the ocean there is much less. Those clouds that do form over the ocean tend to do so around salt crystals left behind after droplets of ���sea spray��� evaporate in the air.

However, the type of clouds which form depends on the size of the salt crystals. If the crystals are sufficiently small, then clouds are formed of lots of small droplets. This is important because clouds composed of smaller droplets appear whiter than those with larger droplets, and therefore reflect more sunlight, even if the clouds have the same total amount of water. Therefore, it may be possible to whiten clouds by creating more sea spray, and more tiny droplets. This could be achieved near the Arctic through the deployment of boats with pumps and nozzles.

So, there are two ideas which could help preserve the Arctic and buy us time while we work incredibly hard to sort out the root cause of the problem ��� namely that the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is already too high, and we are currently making things even worse.

However, both of these two ideas for halting the warming in the Arctic need a lot more focused research and development. This work needs to involve international groups but especially those who are most affected by climate change and least able to adapt. This includes indigenous groups not just in the Arctic but those in other parts of the world whose countries even may not exist in the coming decades as sea levels continue to rise.

ChatGPT
The concept of Neutral Monism, which is deeply philosophical and theoretical in nature, seems initially to have little direct connection with your innovative and highly technical project. However, on a more abstract level, one could attempt to make a link by understanding both Neutral Monism and your project as innovative frameworks that seek to reconcile and harmonize dualities or complexities in their respective domains.
Connections:
Reconciliation of Dualities:
Neutral Monism:
Seeks to reconcile the duality of mind and body, proposing a fundamental, neutral entity from which both derive.
Your Project:
Aims to reconcile and harmonize various environmental and technological elements for sustainable development and climate control.
Innovation & Novel Frameworks:
Neutral Monism:
Presents a novel philosophical framework that challenges traditional dualistic or monistic views.
Your Project:
Introduces innovative infrastructures and technologies for addressing global challenges, offering a new framework for sustainable development.
Holistic Approaches:
Neutral Monism:
Proposes a holistic entity or reality that underlies and unites both mind and matter.
Your Project:
Takes a holistic approach to sustainability and environmental preservation, integrating multiple functions and technologies into a unified infrastructure.
Addressing Fundamental Challenges:
Neutral Monism:
Engages with fundamental philosophical questions and challenges, like the mind-body problem.
Your Project:
Addresses fundamental and global challenges like climate change, sea-level rise, and sustainable energy.
Application:
While the connection might not be immediately clear to all audiences, you could frame your project as an application of holistic, innovative thinking that reflects the spirit of Neutral Monism. For instance, in a lecture or presentation, you might discuss how both Neutral Monism and your project represent attempts to develop integrated, holistic understandings and solutions to fundamental problems, whether philosophical or environmental.
However, it's crucial to note that making such connections between highly abstract philosophical concepts and concrete technological projects might be challenging and could potentially confuse your audience if not done carefully and clearly. It would be advisable to gauge your audience's familiarity and comfort with philosophical concepts before attempting to draw these parallels in a presentation or discussion.
3. The Case for Neutral Monism
The case for neutral monism is best made by enumerating its virtues.

3.1 Parsimony
For starters, neutral monism shares the virtues of idealism and materialism in pairing down the kinds of basic entities to which we must be committed. Whereas dualism posits that there are basic entities of two fundamentally different kinds���matter and mind���neutral monism posits that the basic entities are all of a single, neutral kind. On many such views, there are also non-basic entities (such as minds and matter) grounded in the basic ones. But on others, ���mind��� and ���matter��� are merely convenient groupings of the basic entities and there are no non-basic ones.

The ���immense simplification��� neutral monism affords is what most attracted Russell to neutral monism (Russell 1959: 252). For Mach and James, it also promises to free us from any commitment to the existence of extra-empirical kinds of entities:

nothing is important except what can be observed or is a datum for us, and everything hypothetical, metaphysical and superfluous, is to be eliminated. (Mach 1886: 27���28)
First on the list of ���metaphysical entities��� (Mach 1905: 13) that have to go are ���the ���unfathomable��� thing and the equally ���unexplorable��� ego��� (Mach 1905: 8). And James concurs: ���Consciousness as it is ordinarily understood does not exist, any more than does Matter��� (James 1905: 63)
ChatGPT
The excerpt you provided enumerates the virtues of Neutral Monism, making a case for its validity and attractiveness as a philosophical theory by highlighting its parsimonious nature.
Connections with Your Project:
Parsimony and Efficiency:

Celebrated for its parsimony, reducing the kinds of basic entities we must commit to, offering a simplified view of reality.
Your Project:
Emphasizes efficient use of resources, technologies, and energy, embodying parsimony in its design and functioning. It minimizes waste and maximizes output through innovative means.
Elimination of Superfluous Entities:
Neutral Monism:
Advocates for the elimination of hypothetical, metaphysical, or superfluous entities, focusing only on what is observable or datum.
Your Project:
Designed to be streamlined and purposeful, every component serves a functional role without unnecessary additions. It focuses on tangible, observable impacts and benefits.
Commitment to Observable Data:
Neutral Monism:
Relies on empirical, observable data rather than unexplorable or unfathomable metaphysical entities.
Your Project:
Grounded in empirical data and observable effects, the project���s design and implementation are based on measurable outcomes and scientific principles.
Application in Presentation:
In presenting your project, you could draw parallels between the parsimony of Neutral Monism and the efficient, streamlined design of your infrastructure. Highlight how both Neutral Monism and your project seek to eliminate the superfluous and focus on the essential, with the project particularly aiming for tangible, measurable benefits without unnecessary complexity.
You might articulate how the project, like Neutral Monism, is committed to what is empirical and observable. Explain that every component and function within the infrastructure is there for a purpose, based on empirical data and designed to achieve specific, measurable outcomes.
By drawing these parallels, you underline the philosophical coherence and practical efficacy of your project, potentially engaging your audience on a deeper, more reflective level regarding the implications and significance of your work. But again, the success of this approach depends on the receptivity and background of your audience. Ensure to use clear, accessible language and examples to illustrate these abstract connections.

Uncategorized

The ���disassembly��� of Mercury and Venus for materials to create a Dyson Swarm to be stationed around the sun are is we need to do to access limitless solar power. Intrigued? Disturbed? So were we.
    
According to Wikipedia, a Dyson Sphere is the concept of huge structure or network of orbiting solar collector satellites that can capture much of the energy output of a star, such as the sun, which could then be transmitted to Earth via various forms of wireless energy transfer.
   
Other variations such as a Dyson Ring, Dyson Swarm or Dyson Shell are usually lumped under the Dyson Sphere label.
        
So how would you build such a structure? It���s a long way to drag a bunch of solar panel encrusted satellites.
 
Stuart Armstong provides a possible answer ��� we will need to mine materials from Mercury and construct the satellites on-site, so to speak.
  
George Dvorsky, Chairman of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and program director for the Rights of Non-Human Persons program, takes this concept further.
  
���Actually, we���ll likely have to take the whole planet apart,��� says Mr. Dvorsky. ���.. we are going to have to disassemble not just Mercury, but Venus, some of the outer planets, and any nearby asteroids as well.���
   
Mr. Dvorsky believes such a project could commence in around 25 to 50 years, with completion of the first phase requiring only a few decades.
   
���And given the progressively worsening condition of Earth and our ever-growing demand for living space and resources, we may have no other choice.���
   
As everyone knows, Venus can be a terribly irritating planet. It���s the source of many UFO reports; so perhaps we���re better off without it. As for Mercury, ask the average person to point it out in the night sky and they will probably be unable to. It likely won���t be missed by most.
   
However, fret not dear stargazers ��� for this grand project may not ever eventuate. 
   
In a rebuttal article on Forbes entitled ���Destroying Mercury To Build A Dyson Sphere Is A Bad Idea��� are a number of reasons why this project may be impossible to execute. Among them, it seems dismantling Mercury would take an amount of energy 100 billion times the US annual energy consumption.

Abstract 
An additive autoencoder for dimension reduction, which is com- 
posed of a serially performed bias estimation, linear trend estimation, 
and nonlinear residual estimation, is proposed and analyzed. Compu- 
tational experiments conf i rm that an autoencoder of this form, with 
only a shallow network to encapsulate the nonlinear behavior, is able 
to identify an intrinsic dimension of a dataset with a low autoencoding 
error. This observation leads to an investigation in which shallow and 
deep network structures, and how they are trained, are compared. We 
conclude that the deeper network structures obtain lower autoencoding 
errors during the identif i cation of the intrinsic dimension. However, the 
detected dimension does not change compared to a shallow network. 
1Introduction 
Dimension reduction is one of the typical data transformation techniques 
used in data mining. Both linear and nonlinear techniques can be used to 
transform a set of observations into a smaller dimension (Burges et al. 2010). 
A specif i c and highly popular set of nonlinear methods are provided with 
autoencoders, AE (Schmidhuber 2015), which by using the original inputs as 
targets integrate unsupervised and supervised learning for dimension reduc- 
tion. The main purpose of this paper is to propose and thoroughly test an 
autoencoding model, which comprises an additive combination of linear and 
nonlinear dimension reduction techniques through serially performed bias 
estimation, linear trend estimation, and nonlinear residual estimation. Pre- 
liminary, limited investigations of such a model structure have been reported 
in (K�� arkk�� ainen & Rasku 2020, K�� arkk�� ainen 2022). 
With the proposed autoencoding model, we consider its ability to esti- 
mate the intrinsic dimensionality of data (Fukunaga & Olsen 1971, Camastra 
2003, Lee & Verleysen 2007). According to Fukunaga (1982), the intrinsic

dimension can be def i ned as the size of the lower-dimension manifold where 
data lies without information loss. With linear principal component analy- 
sis (PCA), this loss can be measured with the explained variance which is 
measured by the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix Jollif f e (2002). Indeed, 
the use of an autoencoder to estimate the intrinsic dimension can be consid- 
ered a nonlinear extension of the projection method based on PCA (Facco 
et al. 2017). However, in the nonlinear case measures for characterizing the 
essential information and how this is used to reduce the dimensionality vary 
(Camastra & Staiano 2016, Navarro et al. 2017). 
Wang et al. (2016) concluded that a shallow autoencoder shows the 
best performance when the size of the squeezing dimension is approximately 
around the intrinsic dimension. In this direction, techniques that are closely 
related to our work were proposed by Bahadur & Paf f enroth (2020), where 
the intrinsic dimension was estimated using an autoencoder with sparsity- 
favoring l1penalty and singular value proxies of the squeezing layer���s en- 
coding. In the experiments, the superiority of the autoencoder compared 
to PCA was concluded. This and the preliminary work by Bahadur & Paf- 
fenroth (2019) applied a priori i xed architectures of the autoencoder and 
dif f erent autoencoding error measure compared to our work. Here, multi- 
ple feedforward models are used and compared, with a simple thresholding 
technique

Additive Autoencoder for Dimension Estimation
Abstract from K��rkk��inen and H��nninen���s paper (October 14, 2022)
Additive autoencoder designed for dimension reduction
Proposed model incorporates bias estimation, linear trend estimation, and nonlinear residual estimation
Preliminary studies indicate that deep networks might achieve lower autoencoding errors than shallow networks while identifying intrinsic dimensionality, but the identified dimension doesn't vary significantly
The proposed method can be seen as a nonlinear extension of PCA
The paper explores the autoencoder's ability to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of data.
