The previous subsection focuses on average results across different datasets and only ChatGPT and 
GPT-4 can outperform random guessing on unnatural instructions with l ipped golden verbalizers 
in zero shot CoT prompting. In this subsection, we further delve into each dataset by comparing 
their results using direct prompting with golden verbalizers in natural instructions, direct and zero 
shot CoT prompting with l ipped golden verbalizers on unnatural instructions. We group results 
of datasets according to their tasks (e.g., EMOTION, FP and SST-2 are sentiment classif i cation 
datasets) and results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Results comparison between natural-direct prompting with golden verbalizers, unnatural

ChatGPT and GPT-4. 
ChatGPT and GPT-4 perform comparably on majority of datasets in both natural and un- 
natural instructions.ChatGPT performs similarly on majority of datasets (6/9, 6/9) compared to 
GPT-4 (��� 10% performance gap) on both natural and unnatural instructions, respectively. GPT-4 
outperforms ChatGPT > 10% on RTE and SUBJ in natural settings but underperforms it in un- 
natural setting. Another outlier dataset is MRPC, where GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT 13% and 
53% in natural and unnatural setting, respectively. Overall, these results show that they share more 
similarity than difference via direct prompting. 
ChatGPT and GPT-4 retain performance on sentiment classif i cation task in unnatural direct 
prompting compared to natural counterpart but drop signif i cantly on natural language infer- 
ence task.Surprisingly, we i nd that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can retain their performance on senti- 
ment classif i cation task (FP, EMOTION, SST-2) but drop signif i cantly on natural language inference 
(NLI) task (SNLI, SICK, RTE). As an example, on SST-2, ChatGPT outperforms 1% and GPT-4 
only decreases 5% with unnatural direct prompting while for SICK, ChatGPT and GPT-4 decrease 
96% and 99%, respectively. We hypothesize that the discrepancy is because sentiment classif i cation 
requires less reasoning while NLI requires more, making l ipping golden verbalizers much more 
diff i cult. One may wonder if they show similar trend on other tasks. For paraphrase identif i cation 
task, QQP has similar performance after verbalizer l ipping for both ChatGPT and GPT-4 while for 
MRPC, only ChatGPT drops a lot and GPT-4 retains its performance. This result shows that task 
can be an important factor but not the only one. Models can be sensitive to data distribution. 
ChatGPT and GPT-4 with unnatural-zero shot CoT improve signif i cantly in NLI task but it 
has much less effect on sentiment classif i cation.Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 with unnatural-zero 
shot CoT improve signif i cantly in NLI datasets, and ChatGPT can outperform GPT-4 after zero-shot 
CoT. On the other hand, unnatural-zero shot CoT has much less effect on sentiment classif i ca- 
tion task and even hurts performance across three datasets for ChatGPT. This is probably because 
unnatural-zero shot CoT is mainly useful for reasoning tasks and sentiment classif i cation requires 
much less reasoning compared to NLI tasks, making zero shot CoT less useful.

5CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we design a framework to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of instruction- 
tuned language models via verbalizer manipulations. We design three instruction-following evalu- 
ation sets, namely natural, neural and unnatural instructions, which align with prior knowledge to 
different extents. We evaluate four different model families on nine datasets across scales. Our 
results show that although larger instruction-tuned models generally perform better on both natural 
and neutral instructions, their performance diverges signif i cantly in unnatural instructions. We fur- 
ther examine verbalizers one by one in unnatural instructions, and i nd that the same model family 
performs signif i cantly different on instructions with different verbalizers, even with more advanced 
zero shot CoT prompting. These results show there still exist fundamental limitations within state- 
of-the-art instruction-tuned large language models in following human instructions. We hope that 
our work can inspire future research to focus more on instruction-following capabilities.

This section analyzes performance results of ChatGPT and GPT-4 across different datasets, focusing on how well these models perform with various types of instruction-giving, namely natural, unnatural-direct, and unnatural-zero shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, using what is referred to as "golden verbalizers".
The analysis is conducted on datasets grouped according to their tasks such as sentiment classification (EMOTION, FP, SST-2), natural language inference (SNLI, SICK, RTE), paraphrase identification (QQP, MRPC), and subjectivity classification (SUBJ). The results are depicted in Figure 5, and highlight several key insights:
ChatGPT and GPT-4 perform comparably across most datasets for both natural and unnatural instructions. While GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT on some datasets in natural settings, it underperforms in unnatural settings. In general, the performance gap is usually below 10%.
Both models maintain performance on the sentiment classification task with unnatural-direct prompting compared to natural instructions, but experience a significant drop in performance for natural language inference tasks. The analysis suggests that this might be because sentiment classification requires less reasoning, whereas natural language inference tasks require more.
For unnatural-zero shot CoT prompting, both models improve significantly in natural language inference tasks, but there's less effect on sentiment classification tasks. In fact, this method even hurts performance on sentiment classification tasks for ChatGPT. The reason might be that unnatural-zero shot CoT is more useful for reasoning tasks, which aren't as necessary for sentiment classification.
The overall conclusion is that there are fundamental limitations in state-of-the-art instruction-tuned large language models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, in following human instructions, especially unnatural ones. This study hopes to inspire future research to focus more on improving instruction-following capabilities.

on both natural and neutral instructions. These results are encouraging since it seems that larger 
models can have better instruction-following capabilities even though instructions do not align with 
prior knowledge on neutral instructions. Further comparing model performance on natural and 
neutral instructions, we i nd that smaller models (model size ��� 30B) perform worse on neutral 
instructions. These performance gaps indicate that smaller models still have diff i culty in follow- 
ing instructions. However, their performance gap tends to be smaller when model scales and can 
be (almost) closed for strong OpenAI davinci, ChatGPT and GPT-4, demonstrating their strong 
instruction-following capabilities. These results show that simply scaling model size is an effective 
method to improve model instruction-following capabilities. 
Different model families diverge signif i cantly on unnatural instructions.Although larger mod- 
els generally perform better on both natural and neutral instructions, this is not true for unnatural 
instructions. Different model families diverge signif i cantly on unnatural instructions and there is 
no clear and consistent trend across model families. For Flan-T5, results are U-shaped when model 
scales (Wei et al., 2022b), while for OPT-IML, results follows inverse scaling-shape (McKenzie 
et al., 2022). In fact, results on these two model families are signif i cantly worse than random guess- 
ing (50%). Although Vicuna and GPT-Series follow scaling-shape (Kaplan et al., 2020), their per- 
formance still has large gaps compared to results on natural instructions, and these gaps seem not 
to be smaller when they scale. For example, the performance gap for ChatGPT is 11.8% while 
stronger GPT-4 has 15.7%, making it unclear if further scaling them can bridge this performance 
gap. This is surprising since these clear and valid instructions can be easily followed by humans but 
remain diff i cult for GPT-4, which has shown near human-level performance on many tasks (Bubeck 
et al., 2023). Overall, these results indicate that although scaling is an effective way to improve 
instruction-following, it does not seem to be enough when instructions contradict prior knowledge. 
4.2RESULTS OFDIFFERENTVERBALIZERS INNATURAL ANDUNNATURALINSTRUCTIONS 
Previous discussions focus on average results across different verbalizers for each instruction group. 
However, it is possible that verbalizers even in the same instruction group align or contradict with 
prior knowledge differently. For example, it is hard to know if ���yes��� aligns with prior knowledge 
more than ���1��� in SST-2 dataset for natural instructions with positive golden labels. Therefore, we 
further delve into the results of different verbalizers for natural instructions and its l ipped version 
in unnatural instructions. Average results over nine different datasets are summarized in Figure 3.

not the only factor inf l uencing instruction following although it is important. Further more, we i nd 
that for the largest model in each family, performance is ranked as unnatural 0|1 > unnatural no|yes 
> unnatural-f l ipped golden verbalizers. These results show that although they may have different 
prior knowledge, the diff i culty level of overriding their prior knowledge to follow instructions seems 
consistent. Finally, we i nd that even the best ChatGPT and GPT-4 only perform similar to random 
guessing, showing that these models still have fundamental limitations to follow instructions when 
instructions contradict to their prior knowledge.

The document appears to be an analysis of the performance of different machine learning models on specific datasets, focusing on the difference between natural and unnatural instructions.
The study finds that ChatGPT and GPT-4 significantly outperform random guessing on unnatural instructions, even with "flipped golden verbalizers" in zero-shot CoT prompting. By examining each dataset, the researchers compare results using direct prompting with golden verbalizers in natural instructions and both direct and zero-shot CoT prompting with flipped golden verbalizers in unnatural instructions.
The study reveals that the performances of ChatGPT and GPT-4 are similar on the majority of datasets for both natural and unnatural instructions. For example, on six out of nine datasets, the performance gap between these two models is less than 10%. However, there are some exceptions where the performance of GPT-4 is significantly better or worse than ChatGPT.
Interestingly, the researchers found that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 maintain their performance on sentiment classification tasks when moving from natural to unnatural direct prompting. However, performance significantly drops on natural language inference (NLI) tasks. The researchers hypothesize that this is due to sentiment classification requiring less reasoning than NLI, which makes it more challenging when flipped golden verbalizers are used.
The researchers also observed that the use of unnatural-zero shot CoT significantly improves performance on NLI tasks. However, this technique has much less effect on sentiment classification tasks and even negatively affects performance in some cases. The researchers suggest this is because unnatural-zero shot CoT is mainly useful for reasoning tasks and less so for tasks requiring less reasoning, like sentiment classification.
Overall, the researchers argue that even state-of-the-art instruction-tuned large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have fundamental limitations when it comes to following human instructions, especially when the instructions contradict the models' prior knowledge.

Abstract 
Finetuning language models on a collection of datasets phrased as instructions has been shown to improve 
model performance and generalization to unseen tasks. In this paper we explore instruction i netuning 
with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) i netuning on 
chain-of-thought data. We i nd that instruction i netuning with the above aspects dramatically improves

and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation, RealToxicityPrompts). 
For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-f i netuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PaLM 540B by a large margin 
(+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 
75.2% on i ve-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1which achieve strong few-shot 
performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction i netuning is a 
general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.

1Introduction 
An important goal of artif i cial intelligence is to develop models that can generalize to unseen tasks. In natural 
language processing (NLP), pretrained language models have made signif i cant progress towards this goal, 
as they can perform tasks given natural language descriptions (Brown et al., 2020, inter alia). Further progress 
has been made by i netuning language models on a collection of tasks phrased as instructions, which enables 
models to respond better to instructions and reduces the need for few-shot exemplars (Ouyang et al., 2022; 
Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021, inter alia). 
In this paper we advance instruction i netuning in several ways. First, we study the impact of scaling 
on instruction i netuning. Our experiments show that instruction i netuning does scale well with the 
number of tasks and the size of the model. Their respective scaling behaviors suggest that future research 
should scale up the number of tasks and the size of the model even further. Second, we study the ef f ect of 
i netuning on the ability of the models to perform reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that whereas 
prior instruction i netuning methods that do not include chain-of-thought (CoT; Wei et al., 2022b) severely 
degrade performance on CoT evaluations, adding just nine CoT datasets into the i netuning mixture enables 
better performance on all evaluations. 
Based on these i ndings, we train Flan-PaLM by using a 540B-parameter model, increasing the number of 
i netuning tasks to 1.8K, and including CoT data. Flan-PaLM outperforms PaLM, achieving new state-of-the- 
art on several benchmarks. For instance, Flan-PaLM���s improved reasoning abilities enable it to leverage CoT 
and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022c) to achieve 75.2% on Massive Multi-task Language Understanding 
(MMLU;Hendrycksetal.,2020). Flan-PaLMalsohasimprovedmultilingualabilitiescomparedtoPaLM,such 
as 14.9% absolute improvement on one-shot TyDiQA (Clark et al., 2020) and 8.1% on arithmetic reasoning 
in under-represented languages (Shi et al., 2022). In human rater evaluations, Flan-PaLM substantially 
outperforms PaLM on a challenging set of open-ended generation questions, suggesting improved usability. 
Moreover, we found that instruction i netuning also improves performance across several responsible AI 
evaluation benchmarks. 
In addition, we also instruction-f i netune Flan-T5 models (80M to 11B). These checkpoints have strong zero- 
shot, few-shot, and CoT abilities, outperforming prior public checkpoints such as T5 (Raf f el et al., 2020). For 
example, Flan-T5 11B outperforms T5 11B by double-digit improvements and even outperforms PaLM 62B on 
some challenging BIG-Bench tasks (Srivastava et al., 2022). Overall, our results underscore how instruction 
i netuning can improve performance across a range of models, prompting setups, and evaluation tasks.

This paper discusses advancements in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using instructions. The authors claim that such models can benefit from being fine-tuned on a set of tasks expressed as instructions, which can enhance their performance and ability to generalize to unseen tasks.
The researchers focused on three main areas of interest:
Scaling the number of tasks: They found that instruction fine-tuning scales well with the quantity of tasks, suggesting that increasing the number of tasks further could lead to performance improvements.
Scaling the model size: Similar to task scaling, increasing the size of the model also contributes to performance improvements in instruction fine-tuning.
Fine-tuning on chain-of-thought data: While prior methods of instruction fine-tuning that did not include chain-of-thought (CoT) data saw a decline in performance on CoT evaluations, the inclusion of a small number of CoT datasets significantly improved results.
Based on these findings, the researchers trained a model called Flan-PaLM using a 540 billion-parameter model, 1.8K fine-tuning tasks, and CoT data. This model outperformed the previous model, PaLM, and achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including the Massive Multi-task Language Understanding (MMLU) and the TyDiQA. The model also demonstrated improved multilingual capabilities and scored higher in human rater evaluations on a set of open-ended generation questions.
The authors also fine-tuned Flan-T5 models, which have strong zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT abilities, and outperform previous models such as T5. The Flan-T5 11B model even surpassed the performance of PaLM 62B on some BIG-Bench tasks.
Overall, these results underline the potential of instruction fine-tuning to enhance the performance of LLMs across a range of models, prompting setups, and evaluation tasks.

What will GPT-2030 look like?
JUN 7, 2023  27 MIN READ
GPT-4 surprised many people with its abilities at coding, creative brainstorming, letter-writing, and other skills. Surprises in machine learning are not restricted to GPT-4: I was previously surprised by Minerva���s mathematical abilities, as were many competitive forecasters.

How can we be less surprised by developments in machine learning? Our brains often implicitly make a zeroth-order forecast: looking at the current state of the art, and adding on improvements that ���feel reasonable���. But what ���seems reasonable��� is prone to cognitive bias, and will underestimate progress in a fast-moving field like ML. A more effective approach is first-order forecasting: quantifying the historical rate of progress and extrapolating it forward, while also considering reasons for possible slowdowns or speedups.[1]

In this post, I���ll use this approach to forecast the properties of large pretrained ML systems in 2030. I���ll refer throughout to ���GPT2030���, a hypothetical system that has the capabilities, computational resources, and inference speed that we���d project for large language models in 2030 (but which was likely trained on other modalities as well, such as images). To forecast GPT2030���s properties, I consulted a variety of sources, including empirical scaling laws, projections of future compute and data availability, velocity of improvement on specific benchmarks, empirical inference speed of current systems, and possible future improvements in parallelism.

GPT2030���s capabilities turn out to be surprising (to me at least). In particular, GPT2030 will enjoy a number of significant advantages over current systems[2], as well as (in at least some important respects) current human workers:

GPT2030 will likely be superhuman at various specific tasks, including coding, hacking, and math, and potentially protein design (Section 1).
GPT2030 can ���work��� and ���think��� quickly: I estimate it will be 5x as fast as humans as measured by words processed per minute [range: 0.5x-20x][3], and that this could be increased to 125x by paying 5x more per FLOP (Section 2).
GPT2030 can be copied arbitrarily and run in parallel. The organization that trains GPT2030 would have enough compute to run many parallel copies: I estimate enough to perform 1.8 million years of work when adjusted to human working speeds [range: 0.4M-10M years] (Section 3). Given the 5x speed-up in the previous point, this work could be done in 2.4 months.
GPT2030's copies can share knowledge due to having identical model weights, allowing for rapid parallel learning: I estimate 2,500 human-equivalent years of learning in 1 day (Section 4).
GPT2030 will be trained on additional modalities beyond text and images, possibly including counterintuitive modalities such as molecular structures, network traffic, low-level machine code, astronomical images, and brain scans. It may therefore possess a strong intuitive grasp of domains where we have limited experience, including forming concepts that we do not have (Section 5).
These capabilities would, at minimum, accelerate many areas of research while also creating serious vectors for misuse (Section 6). Regarding misuse, GPT2030's programming abilities, parallelization, and speed would make it a potent cyberoffensive threat. Additionally, its rapid parallel learning could be turned towards human behavior and thus used to manipulate and misinform with the benefit of thousands of "years" of practice.

On acceleration, a main bottleneck will be autonomy. In a domain like mathematics research where work can be checked automatically, I���d predict that GPT2030 will outcompete most professional mathematicians. In machine learning, I���d predict that GPT2030 will independently execute experiments and generates plots and write-ups, but that graduate students and research scientists will provide direction and evaluate results. In both cases, GPT2030 will be an integral part of the research process.

This blog post from "Bounded Regret" titled "What will GPT-2030 look like?" presents a speculative look at the future of large-scale pre-trained machine learning models like GPT-4. The author has projected various aspects of these models' development to 2030, which they've named "GPT2030."
The author uses a method known as "first-order forecasting," which considers the historical rate of progress, projects it forward, and contemplates potential speedups or slowdowns. They looked into multiple sources to predict GPT2030's capabilities, such as empirical scaling laws, future compute and data availability projections, the velocity of improvement on specific benchmarks, and the inference speed of current systems.
Key takeaways from the post include:
Superhuman Abilities
: GPT2030 could be superhuman at several specific tasks, including coding, hacking, mathematics, and potentially even protein design.
Speed
: GPT2030 could work and think quickly. The author estimates that it will be 5 times as fast as humans, measured by words processed per minute, and this speed could be further increased by paying more per FLOP.
Parallelism
: GPT2030 could be copied and run in parallel. This means that many copies of the model can run simultaneously, performing work equivalent to millions of human years in a significantly shortened time.
Shared Knowledge
: Since GPT2030's copies will have identical model weights, they can share knowledge, allowing for rapid parallel learning.
Expanded Training Data
: GPT2030 could be trained on various types of data, not just text and images. This might include seemingly unrelated data like molecular structures, network traffic, low-level machine code, astronomical images, and even brain scans, thus potentially allowing GPT2030 to form concepts and knowledge in domains where humans have limited experience.
The blog post warns that these capabilities could accelerate many areas of research but also pose serious potential for misuse, including cyber threats and misinformation. On a more positive note, the author predicts GPT2030 will become an integral part of the research process in various fields, from mathematics to machine learning.
However, it's important to remember that this post is speculative and based on extrapolating current trends, which might not necessarily continue into the future as expected. The reality of GPT2030 could end up being different due to unforeseen breakthroughs, limitations, or regulatory actions.

My forecast of GPT2030���s properties are not intuitive from looking at today���s systems, and they may be wrong, since there is significant uncertainty about how ML will look in 2030. However, properties (1.-5.) above are my median bet, and whatever GPT2030 is like, I doubt it will be ���GPT-4 but a bit better���.

If I���m right, then whatever the impacts of AI are, they won���t be small. We should be preparing for those impacts now, asking what will happen at the largest scales (on the order of $1T, 10M lives, or significant disruptions to social processes). It���s better to be surprised now, rather than in 7 years when the system is already being rolled out.

I expect GPT2030 to have superhuman coding, hacking, and mathematical abilities. I also expect it to be superhuman in its ability to read and process large corpora for patterns and insights and to recall facts. Finally, since AlphaFold and AlphaZero had superhuman abilities in protein structure prediction and game-playing, GPT2030 could as well, for instance if it was trained multimodally on similar data to the AlphaFold/AlphaZero models.

Programming. GPT-4 outperformed a strong human baseline on LeetCode problems posed after its training cutoff (Bubeck et al. 2023, Table 2), and passed the mock interview for several major tech companies (Figure 1.5). The velocity of improvement remains high, with a 19% jump from GPT-3 to 4. On the more challenging CodeForces competition, GPT-4 does less well, but AlphaCode is on par with the median CodeForces competitor. On the even more challenging APPS dataset, Parsel further outperforms AlphaCode (7.8%->25.5%). Looking forward, the forecasting platform Metaculus gives a median year of 2027 for 80% on APPS, which would exceed all but the very best humans.[4]

Hacking. I expect hacking to improve with general coding ability, plus ML models can scour large codebases for vulnerabilities much more scalably and conscientiously than humans. In fact, ChatGPT has already been used to help generate exploits.

Math. Minerva achieved 50% accuracy on a competition math benchmark (MATH), which is better than most human competitors. The velocity of progress is high (>30% in 1 year), and there is significant low-hanging fruit via autoformalization, reducing arithmetic errors, improving chain-of-thought, and better data[5]. Metaculus predicts 92% on MATH by 2025, and gives a median year of 2028 for AI winning a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad, on par with the best high school students in the world. I personally expect GPT2030 to be better than most professional mathematicians at proving well-posed theorems.[6]

Information processing. Factual recall and processing large corpora are natural consequences of language models��� memorization capabilities and large context windows. Empirically, GPT-4 achieves 86% accuracy on MMLU, a broad suite of standardized exams including the bar exam, MCAT, and college math, physics, biochemistry, and philosophy; even accounting for likely train-test contamination, this probably exceeds the breadth of knowledge of any living human. Regarding large corpora, Zhong et al. (2023) used GPT-3 to construct a system that discovered and described several previously unknown patterns in large text datasets, and scaling trends on a related task in Bills et al. (2023) suggest that models will soon be superhuman. Both of these works exploit the large context windows of LLMs, which are now over 100,000 tokens and growing.

More generally, ML models have a different skill profile than humans, since humans and ML were adapted to very different data sources (evolution vs. massive internet data). At the point that models are human-level at tasks such as video recognition, they will likely be superhuman at many other tasks (such as math, programming, and hacking). Furthermore, additional strong capabilities will likely emerge over time due to larger models and better data, and there is no strong reason to expect model capabilities to ���level out��� at or below human-level. While it is possible that current deep learning approaches will fall short of human-level capabilities in some domains, it is also possible that they will surpass them, perhaps significantly, especially in domains such as math that humans are not evolutionarily specialized for.

2. Inference Speed

(Thanks to Lev McKinney for running the performance benchmarks for this section.)

To study the speed of ML models, we���ll measure how quickly ML models generate text, benchmarking against the human thinking rate of 380 words per minute (Korba (2016), see also Appendix A). Using OpenAI's chat completions API, we estimate that gpt-3.5-turbo can generate 1200 words per minute (wpm), while gpt-4 generates 370 wpm, as of early April 2023. Smaller open source models like pythia-12b achieve at least 1350 wpm with out-of-the-box tools on an A100 GPU, and twice this appears possible with further optimization.

Thus, if we consider OpenAI models as of April, we are either at roughly 3x human speed, or equal to human speed. I predict that models will have faster inference speed in the future, as there are strong commercial and practical pressures towards speeding up inference. Indeed, in the week leading up to this post, GPT-4���s speed already increased to around 540wpm (12 tokens/second), according to Fabien Roger���s tracking data; this illustrates that there is continuing room and appetite for improvement.

My median forecast is that models will have 5x the words/minute of humans (range: [0.5x, 20x]), as that is roughly where there would be diminishing practical benefits to further increases, though there are considerations pointing to both higher or lower numbers. I provide a detailed list of these considerations in Appendix A, as well as comparisons of speeds across model scales and full details of the experiments above.

The second part of the blog post continues the discussion on the projected capabilities of "GPT2030." The author emphasizes that while his predictions may not seem intuitive based on current systems, these are his median bets. There's substantial uncertainty about what machine learning will look like in 2030, and he urges that preparations should be made now for potential impacts that are likely to be large-scale and significant.
The key features of this forecast are:
Specific Capabilities
: The author expects GPT2030 to have superhuman abilities in coding, hacking, and math, as well as in reading and processing large corpora for patterns and insights and in recalling facts.
Programming
: GPT-4 already shows considerable skill in programming tasks, having outperformed a human baseline on LeetCode problems and passed mock interviews for several major tech companies.
Hacking
: The author predicts improvements in hacking abilities due to the model's scalability and ability to meticulously scour large codebases for vulnerabilities.
Math
: With models like Minerva already showing promising results, it is predicted that GPT2030 will surpass most professional mathematicians at proving well-posed theorems.
Information Processing
: GPT2030 is expected to have excellent recall abilities and to process large corpora, which are natural extensions of a language model's memorization capabilities and large context windows.
Inference Speed
: The author expects future models to generate text faster than the human thinking rate. Current models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, already perform well against human benchmarks. Given the commercial and practical pressures for faster inference, it's predicted that future models will be about 5 times faster than human speed at generating words.
While the author does acknowledge that deep learning approaches may fall short of human-level capabilities in some domains, it is also likely that they will surpass human capabilities in domains such as mathematics that humans aren't naturally specialized for.
It's important to note again that these are educated projections and they could be incorrect. There are a lot of unknowns and variables in the development of AI and ML models, and the future could take unexpected turns.
1 / 1
Importantly, the speed of an ML model is not fixed. Models��� serial inference speed can be increased by k2k2 at a cost of a kk-fold reduction in throughput (in other words, k3k3 parallel copies of a model can be replaced with a single model that is k2k2 times faster). This can be done via a parallel tiling scheme that theoretically works even for large values of k2k2, likely at least 100 and possibly more. Thus, a model that is 5x human speed could be sped up to 125x human speed by setting k=5k=5.

An important caveat is that speed is not necessarily matched by quality: as discussed in Section 1, GPT2030 will have a different skill profile than humans, failing at some tasks we find easy and mastering some tasks we find difficult. We should therefore not think of GPT2030 as a "sped-up human", but as a "sped-up worker" with a potentially counterintuitive skill profile.

Nevertheless, considering speed-ups is still informative, especially when they are large. For language models with a 125x speed-up, cognitive actions that take us a day could be completed in minutes, assuming they were within GPT2030's skill profile. Using the earlier example of hacking, exploits or attacks that are slow for us to generate could be created quickly by ML systems.

3. Throughput and Parallel Copies

Models can be copied arbitrarily subject to available compute and memory. This allows them to quickly do any work that can be effectively parallelized. In addition, once one model is fine-tuned to be particularly effective, the change could be immediately propagated to other instances. Models could also be distilled for specialized tasks and thus run faster and more cheaply.

There will likely be enough resources to run many copies of a model once it has been trained. This is because training a model requires running many parallel copies of it, and whatever organization trained the model will still have those resources at deployment time. We can therefore lower bound the number of copies by estimating training costs.

As an example of this logic, the cost of training GPT-3 was enough to run it for 9 x 1011 forward passes. To put that into human-equivalent terms, humans think at 380 words per minute (see Appendix A) and one word is 1.33 tokens on average, so 9 x 1011 forward passes corresponds to ~3400 years of work at human speed. Therefore, the organization could run 3400 parallel copies of the model for a full year at human working-speeds, or potentially the same number of copies for 2.4 months at 5x human speed. (Note: This latter point depends on how many parallel instances the organization can run, see footnote[7] for details.)

Let's next project this same ���training overhang��� (ratio of training to inference cost) for future models. It should be larger: the main reason is that training overhang is roughly proportional to dataset size, and datasets are increasing over time. This trend will be slowed as we run out of naturally-occuring language data, but new modalities as well as synthetic or self-generated data will still push it forward.[8] In Appendix B, I consider these factors in detail to project forward to 2030. I forecast that models in 2030 will be trained with enough resources to perform 1,800,000 years of work adjusted to human speed [range: 400k-10M].

Note that Cotra (2020) and Davidson (2023) estimate similar quantities and arrive at larger numbers than me; I'd guess the main difference is how I model the effect of running out of natural language data.

The projection above is somewhat conservative, since models may be run on more resources than they were trained on if the organization buys additional compute. A quick ballpark estimate suggests that GPT-4 was trained on about 0.01% of all computational resources in the world, although I expect future training runs to use up a larger share of total world compute and therefore have less room to scale up further after training. Still, an organization could possibly increase the number of copies they run by another order of magnitude if they had strong reasons to do so.

4. Knowledge Sharing

(Thanks to Geoff Hinton who first made this argument to me.)

Different copies of a model can share parameter updates. For instance, ChatGPT could be deployed to millions of users, learn something from each interaction, and then propagate gradient updates to a central server where they are averaged together and applied to all copies of the model. In this way, ChatGPT could observe more about human nature in an hour than humans do in a lifetime (1 million hours = 114 years). Parallel learning may be one of the most important advantages models have, as it means they can rapidly learn any missing skills.

The rate of parallel learning depends on how many copies of a model are running at once, how quickly they can acquire data, and whether the data can be efficiently utilized in parallel. On the last point, even extreme parallelization should not harm learning efficiency much, as batch sizes in the millions are routine in practice, and the gradient noise scale (McCandlish et al., 2018) predicts minimal degradation in learning performance below a certain ���critical batch size���. We'll therefore focus on parallel copies and data acquisition.

I will provide two estimates that both suggest it would be feasible to have at least ~1 million copies of a model learning in parallel at human speed. This corresponds to 2500 human-equivalent years of learning per day, since 1 million days = 2500 years.

The first estimate uses the numbers from Section 3, which concluded that the cost of training a model is enough to simulate models for 1.8M years of work (adjusted to human speed). Assuming that the training run itself lasted for less than 1.2 years (Sevilla et al., 2022), this means the organization that trained the model has enough GPUs to run 1.5M copies at human speed.

The second estimate considers the market share of the organization deploying the model. For example, if there are 1 million users querying the model at a time, then the organization necessarily has the resources to serve 1 million copies of the model. As a ballpark, ChatGPT had 100 million users as of May 2023 (not all active at once), and 13 million active users/day as of January 2023. I���d assume the typical user is requesting a few minutes worth of model-generated text, so the January number probably only implies around 0.05 million person-days of text each day. However, it seems fairly plausible that future ChatGPT-style models would 20x this, reaching 250 million active users/day or more and hence 1 million person-days of data each day. As a point of comparison, Facebook has 2 billion daily active users.

5. Modalities, Tools, and Actuators

Historically, GPT-style models have primarily been trained on text and code, and had limited capacity to interact with the outside world except via chat dialog. However, this is rapidly changing, as models are being trained on additional modalities such as images, are being trained to use tools, and are starting to interface with physical actuators. Moreover, models will not be restricted to anthropocentric modalities such as text, natural images, video, and speech---they will likely also be trained on unfamiliar modalities such as network traffic, astronomical images, or other massive data sources.

Tools. Recently-released models use external tools, as seen with ChatGPT plugins as well as Schick et al. (2023), Yao et al. (2022), and Gao et al. (2022). Text combined with tool use is sufficient to write code that gets executed, convince humans to take actions on their behalf, make API calls, make transactions, and potentially execute cyberattacks. Tool use is economically useful, so there will be strong incentives to further develop this capability.

New modalities. There are now large open-source vision-language models such as OpenFlamingo, and on the commercial side, GPT-4 and Flamingo were both trained on vision and text data. Researchers are also experimenting with more exotic pairs of modalities such as proteins and language (Guo et al., 2023).

We should expect the modalities of large pretrained models to continue to expand, for two reasons. First, economically, it is useful to pair language with less familiar modalities (such as proteins) so that users can benefit from explanations and efficiently make edits. This predicts multimodal training with proteins, biomedical data, CAD models, and any other modality associated with a major economic sector.

Second, we are starting to run out of language data, so model developers will search for new types of data to continue benefiting from scale. Aside from the traditional text and videos, some of the largest existing sources of data are astronomical data (will soon be at exabytes per day) and genomic data (around 0.1 exabytes/day). It is plausible that these and other massive data sources will be leveraged for training GPT2030.

The use of exotic modalities means that GPT2030 might have unintuitive capabilities. It might understand stars and genes much better than we do, even while it struggles with basic physical tasks. This could lead to surprises, such as designing novel proteins, that we would not have expected based on GPT2030���s level of ���general��� intelligence. When thinking about the impacts of GPT2030, it will be important to consider specific superhuman capabilities it might possess due to these exotic data sources.

Actuators. Models are also beginning to use physical actuators: ChatGPT has already been used for robot control and OpenAI is investing in a humanoid robotics company. However, it is much more expensive to collect data in physical domains than digital domains, and humans are also more evolutionarily adapted to physical domains (so the bar for ML models to compete with us is higher). Compared to digital tools, I���d therefore expect mastery of physical actuators to occur more slowly, and I���m unsure if we should expect it by 2030. Quantitatively, I���d assign 40% probability to there being a general-purpose model in 2030 that is able to autonomously assemble a scale-replica Ferrari as defined in this Metaculus question.

6. Implications of GPT-2030

We���ll next analyze what a system like GPT2030 would mean for society. A system with GPT2030���s characteristics would, at minimum, significantly accelerate some areas of research, while also possessing powerful capacities for misuse.

I���ll start by framing some general strengths and limitations of GPT2030, then use this as a lens to analyze both acceleration and misuse.

Strengths. GPT2030 represents a large, highly adaptable, high-throughput workforce. Recall that GPT2030 could do 1.8 million years of work[9] across parallel copies, where each copy is run at 5x human speed. This means we could (subject to parallelism constraints) simulate 1.8 million agents working for a year each in 2.4 months. As discussed above, we could pay 5x per FLOP to get an additional 25x speedup (to 125x human speed), so we could also simulate 14,000 agents working for a year each in 3 days[10].

ChatGPT
The potential capabilities of such a workforce are vast, especially when considering tasks that fall within GPT2030's skill profile. With such a large number of copies running in parallel, each at a significantly faster rate than human speed, many tasks that would take humans weeks, months, or even years to accomplish could potentially be completed in just a few hours or days.
However, the skills of GPT2030 may not align perfectly with those of humans. As mentioned earlier, this model may struggle with tasks that humans find easy, while excelling at tasks we find difficult. This could lead to some surprising and unexpected capabilities, such as understanding genomic data or astronomical data far better than a human could. Such capabilities could enable significant advancements in research fields like biology and astrophysics, but might also pose risks in terms of misuse, especially if such capabilities are accessible to malicious actors.
Limitations. Despite its immense speed and potential for parallel operation, GPT2030 is not without its limitations. It won't have the same understanding of the world that a human has. This will limit its ability to carry out some tasks that rely on a deep and nuanced understanding of human society, culture, or personal experience.
Additionally, while GPT2030 may be able to use physical actuators to some extent, its interaction with the physical world will likely be more limited than its digital capabilities. This is because it's more expensive to collect data in physical domains, and humans are more evolved to interact with the physical world. This limitation means that GPT2030 might not be as effective in tasks that require physical interaction or manipulation, such as building a scale model of a car.
Acceleration. In terms of accelerating research and development, GPT2030 could be a game-changer. It could be deployed to analyze vast datasets in a fraction of the time it would take human researchers, allowing for rapid discoveries and advancements in a wide range of fields. For example, in drug discovery, GPT2030 could be used to analyze and predict the effects of new compounds, potentially speeding up the process of finding effective treatments for various diseases.
Misuse. However, these same capabilities also pose risks in terms of misuse. For example, GPT2030 could potentially be used to carry out cyberattacks at a speed and scale that would be hard to counter. Its ability to understand and analyze large datasets could also be used for nefarious purposes, such as mass surveillance or data theft. Therefore, it's important to consider potential safeguards and regulations that might be necessary to prevent such misuse.
To summarize, the arrival of a system like GPT2030 could have profound implications for society. Its potential to accelerate research and development in many fields could lead to significant advancements and benefits. However, these benefits will need to be balanced against the potential risks and drawbacks, particularly in terms of misuse and the potential impacts on the workforce.
1 / 1
Limitations. There are three obstacles to utilizing this digital workforce: skill profile, experiment cost, and autonomy. On the first, GPT2030 will have a different skill profile from humans that makes it worse at some tasks (but better at others). On the second, simulated workers still need to interface with the world to collect data, which has its own time and compute costs. Finally, on autonomy, models today can only generate a few thousand tokens in a chain-of-thought before getting ���stuck���, entering a state where they no longer produce high-quality output. We���d need significant increases in reliability before delegating complex tasks to models. I expect reliability to increase, but not without limit: my (very rough) guess is that GPT2030 will be able to run for several human-equivalent days before having to be reset or steered by external feedback. If models run at a 5x speed-up, that means they need human oversight every several hours.

Therefore, the tasks that GPT2030 would most impact are tasks that:

Leverage skills that GPT2030 is strong at relative to humans.

Only require external empirical data that can be readily and quickly collected (as opposed to costly physical experiments).

Can be a priori decomposed into subtasks that can be performed reliably, or that have clear and automatable feedback metrics to help steer the model.

Acceleration. One task that readily meets all three criteria is mathematics research. On the first, GPT2030 will likely have superhuman mathematical capabilities (Section 1). On the second and third, math can be done purely by thinking and writing, and we know when a theorem has been proved. There are furthermore not that many mathematicians in total in the world (e.g. only 3,000 in the US) so GPT2030 could likely simulate more than the annual output of all mathematicians every several days.

Significant parts of ML research also meet the criteria above. GPT2030 would be superhuman at programming, which includes implementing and running experiments. I���d guess it will also be good at presenting and explaining the results of experiments, given that GPT-4 is good at explaining complex topics in an accessible way (and there is significant market demand for this). Therefore, ML research might reduce to thinking up good experiments to run and interfacing with high-quality (but potentially unreliable) write-ups of the results. In 2030, grad students might therefore have the same resources as a professor with several strong students would have today.

Parts of social science could also be significantly accelerated. There are many papers where the majority of the work is chasing down, categorizing, and labeling scientifically interesting sources of data and extracting important patterns���see Acemoglu et al. (2001) or Webb (2020) for representative examples. This satisfies requirement (3.) because categorization and labeling can be decomposed into simple subtasks, and it satisfies requirement (2.) as long as the data is available on the internet, or could be collected through an online survey.

Misuse. Beyond acceleration, there would be serious risks of misuse. The most direct case is cyberoffensive hacking capabilities. Inspecting a specific target for a specific style of vulnerability could likely be done reliably, and it is easy to check if an exploit succeeds (subject to being able to interact with the code), so requirement (3.) is doubly satisfied. On (2.), GPT2030 would need to interact with target systems to know if the exploit works, which imposes some cost, but not enough to be a significant bottleneck. Moreover, the model could locally design and test exploits on open source code as a source of training data, so it could become very good at hacking before needing to interact with any external systems. Thus, GPT2030 could rapidly execute sophisticated cyberattacks against large numbers of targets in parallel.

A second source of misuse is manipulation. If GPT2030 interacts with millions of users at once, then it gains more experience about human interaction in an hour than a human does in their lifetime (1 million hours = 114 years). If it used these interactions to learn about manipulation, then it could obtain manipulation skills that are far greater than humans���as an analogy, con artists are good at tricking victims because they���ve practiced on hundreds of people before, and GPT2030 could scale this up by several orders of magnitude. It could therefore be very good at manipulating users in one-on-one conversation, or at writing news articles to sway public opinion.

Thus in summary, GPT2030 could automate almost all mathematics research as well as important parts of other research areas, and it could be a powerful vector of misuse regarding both cyberattacks and persuasion/manipulation. Much of its impact would be limited by ���oversight bottlenecks���, so if it could run autonomously for long periods of time then its impact may be larger still.

Appendix: Runtime and Training Estimates for Future Models

A. Words per minute

First we���ll estimate the word per minute of humans and of current models. Then we���ll extrapolate from current models to future models.

For humans, there are five numbers we could measure: talking speed, reading speed, listening speed, and both ���elliptic��� and ���extended��� thinking speed. Regarding the first three, Rayner and Clifton (2009) say that reading speed is 300 words per minute[11] and speaking is 160 words per minute[12], and that listening can be done 2-3 times faster than speaking (so ~400 words per minute)[13]. For thinking speed, we need to distinguish between ���elliptic��� and ���extended��� thought���it turns out that we think in flashes of words rather than complete sentences, and if we extend these flashes to full sentences we get very different word counts (~10x different). Korba (2016) find that elliptic thought is 380 words per minute while extended thought is ~4200 words per minute. Since most of these numbers cluster in the 300-400 wpm range, I���ll use 380 words per minute as my estimate of human thinking speed. Using the 4:3 token to word ratio suggested by OpenAI, this comes out to 500 tokens per minute.[14]

(Thanks to Lev McKinney for running the evaluations in the following paragraphs.)
Next, let���s consider current models. We queried gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, as well as several open source models from EleutherAI, to benchmark their inference speed. We did this by querying the models to count from 1 to n, where n ranged from 100 to 1900 inclusive in increments of 100. Since numbers contain more than one token, we cut the model off when it reached n tokens generated, and measured the time elapsed. We then ran a linear regression with a bias term to account for latency in order to estimate the asymptotic number of tokens per second.

GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo were queried from the OpenAI AIP in early April 2023. All experiments for the pythia models were performed using deepspeed's injected kernels and fp16 models on a single A100 GPU.[15] Code for replicating these results can be found at https://github.com/levmckinney/llm-racing.

The raw data is plotted in Figure 1 below, while Figure 2 and Table 1 give the resulting estimated tokens per minute.

���

Figure 1 demonstrates how model inference scales with token input. Note that time per token remains relatively linear at these context lengths.

���

Figure 2 and the table below demonstrates how model inference speed scales with size. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.

Model nameTokens per minutegpt-4493gpt-3.5-turbo1641EleutherAI/pythia-12b-deduped1801EleutherAI/pythia-6.9b-deduped2659EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b-deduped4568EleutherAI/pythia-1.4b-deduped7040EleutherAI/pythia-410m-deduped11039EleutherAI/pythia-160m-deduped21580EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped31809

Thus, GPT-4 is close to the human benchmark of 500 tokens/minute, while GPT-3.5-turbo is about 3x faster. Smaller models are an order of magnitude faster still, which indicates that even faster inference is possible, although it also suggests that future larger models may be slower (not accounting for better hardware and other optimizations). Inference speed in practice seems to slow down sublinearly with model size���in the pythia models, increasing size by a factor of k decreases inference speed by approximately k0.6.

How will models��� words per minute change in the future? There are factors pushing towards both faster and slower speeds:

Larger models are more expensive to run, especially if they have more layers (larger widths can be parallelized, but larger depths cannot be).

Inference will generally be optimized more, e.g. via early exiting, sparse attention, cross-GPU parallelization, or better hardware. There is quite a bit of headroom here, especially from parallelization and hardware (see discussion below).

In particular, there will be quite a bit of incentive to make models fast enough to be easily usable (e.g. faster than human reading speed).

After staring at lots of data about trends in model size, GPU architecture, etc. for 10+ hours, I mostly concluded that I am very uncertain about how the competing trends of larger models vs. better hardware and software will play out. My median guess would be that we get models that are noticeably faster than humans (5x), but I wouldn���t be surprised by anything from 2x slower to 20x faster.

Importantly, these speeds are only if we demand maximum throughput from the GPUs. If we are willing to sacrifice throughput by a factor of k, we can speed up inference by a factor of k^2, up to fairly large values of k. So if models are only 5x faster than humans by default, they could instead be 125x faster in exchange for a 5x reduction in throughput, and this could be pushed further still if necessary.

Finally, aside from raw speed, words/minute isn���t apples-to-apples across humans and language models. For one, the language models aren���t just thinking but also writing, and in some cases they are writing content that would be much slower for humans to produce (e.g. code, or arguments with references). In the other direction, language models are currently quite verbose, so one word from a language model does less ���work��� than one word from a human. This verbosity could be fine-tuned away, but it���s not clear we could match the efficiency of elliptic thought in humans. Finally, tokenization and word complexity will change over time, and so the 1.333x conversation ratio from words to tokens won���t stay constant (indeed, I���d guess it���s already an underestimate for today���s models since they now tend to use complex words with prefixes and suffixes).

Details on parallelization and hardware speed-ups. As described in How Fast Can We Perform a Forward Pass?, there are parallel tiling schemes that significantly increase serial inference speed with only minor overhead. For instance, parallel tiling of GPT-3 would increase its inference speed by 30x or more on an A100 cluster relative to running it on a single 8-GPU machine[16]. These optimizations are not currently widely used because they aren���t useful for training and slightly decrease inference throughput, but people would start using them once inference time becomes a bottleneck.

This post explores the potential impacts and limitations of advanced language models like the hypothesized "GPT2030" on various fields, particularly mathematics research, machine learning research, and social science, while also considering potential misuse scenarios.
Limitations
: The use of advanced language models is limited by three main factors: skill profile, experiment cost, and autonomy. GPT2030 will likely have a skill profile different from humans, being better at some tasks but worse at others. It will still require interfacing with the real world to gather data, which has its own time and compute costs. The ability for GPT2030 to generate a coherent chain of thought is currently limited to a few thousand tokens before the quality deteriorates. This will need to improve for more complex tasks to be delegated to models.
Acceleration
: Tasks that GPT2030 could significantly impact are those that it's good at relative to humans, require quickly obtainable empirical data, and can be broken down into subtasks or have clear, automatable feedback metrics. This makes areas such as mathematics research, certain aspects of machine learning research, and some social science tasks likely candidates for automation with GPT2030.
Misuse
: There are also potential risks of misuse. Cyberoffensive hacking capabilities and manipulation are significant risks. GPT2030 could rapidly design and execute sophisticated cyberattacks. It could also potentially learn manipulation techniques, having more interaction experience in an hour than a human would in their lifetime, making it adept at manipulating individuals or influencing public opinion.

For hardware, GPUs are becoming more powerful, which will speed up inference. However, GPUs are also being built to require larger arithmetic intensity, which will decrease the amount of parallel tiling (see previous point) that is possible. For reference, I���ve included the specs of all NVIDIA GPUs below. The ���Mem Bandwidth��� column measures the serial throughput without any cross-GPU parallelization[17], while the final M3/C2 column measures serial throughput with the maximum cross-GPU parallelization that maintains high enough arithmetic intensity[18]. The former is steadily increasing, while the latter jumps around but has tended to decrease.

B. Training overhang

There will likely be enough resources to run many copies of a model once it has been trained. GPT-3 took 3.1e23 FLOPs to train and requires 3.5e11 FLOPs for a forward pass, so 9e11 forward passes could be run for the cost of training. Using the 500 tokens per minute conversion from Appendix A, this would correspond to ~3400 human-years of thinking.

How will this change in the future? I���ll use the Chinchilla scaling law and projections of future training costs to form an initial estimate, then I���ll consider ways we could deviate from the Chinchilla trend. For future training costs, I consider the projection in Besiroglu et al. (2022), who analyzed over 500 existing models to extrapolate compute trends in machine learning. Their central projection of training FLOPs in 2030 is 4.7e28, with a range of 5.1e26 to 3.0e30. Metaculus has a similar estimate of 2.3e27 (for Jan 1, 2031)[19]. Taking the geometric median, I���ll use 1.0e28 as my estimate of training FLOPs, or a 33,000-fold increase over GPT-3. Since the Chinchilla scaling law implies that model size (and hence inference cost) scales as the square-root of training cost, this means the training overhang should increase by sqrt(33000), or around 180-fold. The 3400 human-years of thinking would thus increase to 620,000 human-years. However, there���s an additional consideration, which is that GPT-3 was actually trained with suboptimal scaling. The ideal size of GPT-3 (given its training cost) would have been 4 times smaller, so we need to add an additional factor of 4, to get 2.5M human-years, with a range from 0.8M to 9M accounting for uncertainty in the number of training FLOPs[20].

Next, let���s consider deviations from the Chinchilla scaling law. The most obvious deviation is that we might soon run out of data. This could either mean that larger models becomes more attractive relative to more data (which would decrease training overhang), or that we generate additional synthetic data (makes creating data more computationally-expensive, which would increase training overhang), or we move to new data-rich modalities such as video (unclear effect on training overhand, probably increases it). To roughly bound these effects:

Lower bound: Villalobos et al. (2022) estimate that we will run out of high-quality language data (e.g. Wikipedia, books, scientific papers, etc.) by 2026, although we will not run out of low-quality data (e.g. web pages) before 2030. In a pessimistic world where high-quality data is a completely binding constraint, the model in Villalobos et al. implies an 8x increase in dataset size by 2030, meaning the training overhang would increase only 8-fold instead of 180-fold.

Upper bound: If we run out of data, we might generate new data synthetically. One possibility for this is chain-of-thought distillation as in Huang et al. (2022). In that paper, 32 chains of thought are generated on each input instance, only some of which are used for training updates. Assume that on average 5 of the 32 chains of thought get used for training updates, and that a backward pass is twice the cost of a forward pass. Then the cost per training update is equivalent to 2 + 32/5 = 8.4 forward passes, compared to 3 previously, or a 2.8x increase. Under Chinchilla scaling this cost propagates forward to an additional sqrt(2.8) = 1.7x increase in training overhang, i.e. 300-fold instead of 180-fold.

Overall, the lower bound seems fairly pessimistic to me as we���ll almost certainly find some way to leverage lower-quality or synthetic data. On the other hand, beyond running out of data, we might find ways to make the training process more efficient via e.g. curriculum learning. Accounting for this, my personal guess is we will end up somewhere between a 12-fold and 200-fold increase in overhang, with a central estimate of 100x, yielding a training overhang of around 1.8M human-years of thinking. We would also want to expand our range to account for the additional uncertainty from deviations to the Chinchilla scaling law. Subjectively, I���d increase the range to be 0.4M to 10M.

All of these estimates are for 2030. In general, the numbers above would be larger for later years and smaller for earlier years.

As an additional point of comparison, Karnofsky (2022) (following Cotra, 2020) estimates that the cost to train a human-level model would be enough compute to run 100 million copies of the model for a year each, although that estimate assumes training runs that use 1e30 FLOPs instead of 1e28. Even accounting for that, this seems a bit high to me, and I���d have been closer to 18 million than 100 million based on the square-root scaling above.

Though actually, zeroth order forecasting already helps a lot if done right! Many who were surprised by ChatGPT would have already been impressed by text-davinci-003, which was released much earlier but with a less user-friendly interface. ������

As a specific point of comparison, GPT-3 only had enough compute to run 3400 human-adjusted years of work, and I'd guess it could do less than 100 human-adjusted years of learning per day. I'd guess GPT-4 is at 130,000 human-adjusted years of work and 125 adjusted years of learning. So GPT2030 is at least an order of magnitude larger on both axes. ������

Throughout, the range in brackets represents the 25th to 75th percentile of my predictive distribution. In practice the range is probably too narrow because I only did a mainline forecast without accounting for ���other��� options. ������

Qualitatively, GPT-4 Bubeck et al. also found that GPT-4 could produce a 400-line 3D game zero-shot, which is probably impossible for nearly all humans. ������

See Forecasting ML Benchmarks in 2023 for some further discussion of this. ������

Concretely, I���d assign 50% probability to the following: ���If we take 5 randomly selected theorem statements from the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics and give them to the math faculty at UCSD, GPT2030 would solve a larger fraction of problems than the median faculty and have a shorter-than-median solve time on the ones that it does solve.��� ������

I am assuming the initial training run was less than a year (Sevilla et al., 2022), from which it follows that the organization can at least parallelize enough to run the 9 x 1011 forward passes within a year, subject to constraints on inference speed. To do so in 2.4 months, they may need further improvements. I think this is plausible (but not certain), both because the organization might have trained the model in less than a year, and because there may be tricks available for inference that were not for training. ������

A second factor is that GPT-3 was trained suboptimally, and with optimal (Chinchilla-style) scaling the training overhang would be 4x larger already. ������

Adjusted to human working speeds. ������

The math here is that with a perfect speed-up, 1.8 milion / 25 = 72,000, but the extra 5x per FLOP makes it 14,000. ������

���skilled readers typically reading at rates between 250-350 words per minute��� ������

���estimates of normal speaking rate range from 120 to 200 words per minute��� ������

���Experiments on compressed speech suggest that comprehension can be successful at two times or more the normal rate (e.g., Dupoux & Green, 1997)��� ������

I personally think that 4:3 is too optimistic and 3:2 or even 2:1 might be more realistic, but I���ll stick to 4:3 throughout the doc since it was the main citation I found. ������

The performance for pythia models can likely be improved further. For instance, NVIDIA has reported about 80 tokens per second on a comparable model to pythia-6.9 billion on a single A100. When allowing for more hardware, they have even shown approximately 90 tokens per second using 8 way tensor parallelism on an 8xA100 SuperPod architecture when generating using a 20B parameter GPT model. ������

A single A100 can handle matrix multiplies as small as 1024x1024 before becoming bottlenecked on memory reads, and the main operation in GPT-3 is a 12288 x (4*12288) matrix multiply, meaning we would tile it across 576 GPUs (72 machines). This would naively mean a 72x speedup, but there is probably enough overhead that I���m estimating closer to 30x. ������

Roughly speaking, with no cross-GPU tiling, the serial speed of inference is determined by the memory bandwidth, e.g. the A100 with 2039GB/s bandwidth should be able to complete 2039/175 \approx 12 forward passes with a 175B parameter model per second (up to constant factors). ������

With parallel tiling, the forward passes per second is proportional to M3/54C2L, where C = Compute, M = Mem bandwidth, and L = # of layers. (see here for details). The final column gives M3/C2. ������

Metaculus also estimates that the largest model trained will have 2.5e15 parameters (for Jan 1, 2030), meaning a forward pass costs 5e15 FLOPs. If we naively take the ratio, we again get 9e11 forward passes, but I think this is not the right calculation, because the largest model trained will likely not be state-of-the-art but rather something like the 174 trillion parameter BaGuaLu model. ������

I���m basing this on Metaculus giving a range of 5M to 660M as the interquartile range of their estimate, and propagating the uncertainty through the square-root function. ������

For the 1.8 million years of work, I'm not clear on what rate that would happen at by default. Does it equal the training period because we're assuming the same amount of compute? Thus if training took a year, we would have access to 1.8 million years of work per year? It's interesting to think about how big a deal this would be. One metric would be 10 Googles; another would be <0.1% of the world's population.

Abstract
While instruction-tuned models have shown remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, accurately evaluating their ability to follow instructions remains challenging. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on common instructions that align well with what the model learned during training. However, proficiency in responding to these instructions does not necessarily imply strong ability in instruction following. In this paper, we propose a novel instruction-following evaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation. It instructs the model to verbalize the task label with words aligning with model priors to different extents, adopting verbalizers from highly aligned (e.g., outputting ``postive'' for positive sentiment), to minimally aligned (e.g., outputting ``negative'' for positive sentiment). Verbalizer manipulation can be seamlessly integrated with any classification benchmark to examine the model's reliance on priors and its ability to override them to accurately follow the instructions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of four major model families across nine datasets, employing twelve sets of verbalizers for each of them. We observe that the instruction-following abilities of models, across different families and scales, are significantly distinguished by their performance on less natural verbalizers. Even the strongest GPT-4 model struggles to perform better than random guessing on the most challenging verbalizer, emphasizing the need for continued advancements to improve their instruction-following abilities.

This paper is titled "Instruction-following Evaluation through Verbalizer Manipulation," and it was written by Shiyang Li, Jun Yan, Hai Wang, Zheng Tang, Xiang Ren, Vijay Srinivasan, and Hongxia Jin. The authors propose a new method to evaluate the ability of AI models to follow instructions. They note that while instruction-tuned models are very successful in a variety of natural language processing tasks, evaluating their ability to follow instructions is still a challenge.
Their proposal, called verbalizer manipulation, involves instructing the model to "verbalize" (or output) the label of a task using words that either align closely with the model's training data or do not align at all. For instance, a "highly aligned" task might involve outputting the word "positive" for positive sentiment, while a "minimally aligned" task might involve outputting the word "negative" for positive sentiment.
This approach is designed to test a model's reliance on its training data, and its ability to override these priors (pre-existing knowledge based on training data) to follow instructions accurately. The authors tested this approach on four major model families across nine datasets, using twelve sets of verbalizers for each.
They found that models' ability to follow instructions could be significantly distinguished by their performance on less natural (or minimally aligned) verbalizers. Even the strongest GPT-4 model struggled to perform better than random guessing on the most challenging verbalizer. This finding emphasizes the need for continued progress in improving AI models' instruction-following abilities.

Yes that is why I will also need open source models like llama, I have 15,000 github repositories to summarize as well.

ChatGPT
Handling the summarization of 15,000 GitHub repositories in addition to the large volume of PDFs and Wikipedia pages is indeed a significant task. Open source models like Llama can be valuable resources in assisting with this endeavor. Here's a general approach you could consider:

Data Extraction:

Extract the relevant textual content from the GitHub repositories. This includes source code, commit messages, issue discussions, and README files. Additionally, gather metadata such as repository descriptions, tags, and user information.

Text Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the extracted text by removing irrelevant information, formatting code snippets, and normalizing the text for further analysis. This step helps to improve the quality of the generated summaries.

Topic Modeling:

Apply topic modeling techniques, such as LDA or Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), to identify the main themes and topics within the repositories. This helps in understanding the overall content and organizing the repositories into meaningful categories.

Extractive Summarization:

Utilize extractive summarization methods to extract key sentences, comments, or code snippets from each repository. Techniques like TextRank or TF-IDF can be employed to identify the most important and representative content.

Cross-Repository Analysis:

Perform cross-repository analysis to identify similarities, patterns, and dependencies between different repositories. This can help identify common themes or functionalities across the codebase.

Evaluation and Refinement:

Establish an evaluation process to assess the quality and coherence of the generated summaries. Incorporate feedback from domain experts or users to refine and improve the summarization results.

Keep in mind that summarizing code repositories presents unique challenges, as code can have complex structures and semantics. Some open source tools, such as CodeBERT or Code2Vec, might be helpful in understanding and summarizing code-specific information.

It's important to note that a project of this scale requires substantial computational resources, including storage, processing power, and memory. Utilizing cloud-based or distributed computing infrastructure may be necessary to handle the large volume of data efficiently.

Lastly, consider contributing to and collaborating with the open source community. By sharing your findings, code, and methodologies, you can contribute to the collective knowledge and benefit from the expertise of others working on similar tasks.

Summarizing such a vast number of GitHub repositories is a challenging undertaking, and it will require a combination of specialized tools, open source models like Llama, and expertise in natural language processing and software development.

Thoughts Concerning the Eloi.txt

My goodness, this is frightening.  WANTS everyone to become Eloi.

In the context of Pokemon Go I said that people are behaving like children. A confluence of evidence.

Michael Ferguson, July 14, 2016

"Work is for robots so that we may play"

Monica Anderson, July 13, 2016

Understanding Machines ("AI") and better robots will make many kinds of jobs obsolete and will make entirely new categories of jobs available.

There will be a net loss of repetitive jobs and we will share the work that is left with shorter hours; many people in Sweden only work 6 hour days, and short work weeks are not uncommon in Europe.

A valid path forward would be successively shorter working hours and sharing jobs with others, until we reach a level we are happy with.

But some people holding jobs that robots could easily do would resent being laid off ��� even if they were able to maintain their standard of living through a guaranteed minimum income of some kind.

Because their work may be the only thing that gives them a sense of accomplishing something.

But what if everyone found more than one way to accomplish something, to finish something, to make some progress on something... every day.

If work was just one of a handful of things you would typically accomplish in a day, then losing a job might not hurt as much. "I accomplished dinner". "I aced my exam in the MOOC". "I managed two more sit-ups". "I leveled again in my game".

We all need to diversify our lives a bit. Social media, games, volunteer efforts, education, traveling the world, community work, time with family, direct improvement of personal standard of living, and random acts of kindness will provide the sense of meaning and accomplishment we need in life.

"Work is for robots so that we may Pokemon"

Many people may find it ridiculous and may refuse to acknowledge it, but they will feel a sense of accomplishment when they bag a Pikachu and this will keep them happy for a day :-).

We need (and will get) more alternative ways to find self-worth. Some of these will be less useful than others; but that's also true for work today. A protestant work ethic was required because there was nobody else to do the work; we had no robots. It's time to let go of that.

It seems like this is a perspective on the future of work and societal values as automation and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to develop and take over more tasks traditionally done by humans.
The Eloi are a reference to H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine," where they represent a future human species that has grown soft and childlike due to the absence of any need to work or struggle. In the text you provided, the comparison to the Eloi seems to be a metaphor for a society where work is no longer a primary source of personal value or meaning because much of it is done by robots or AI.
The concerns raised here are about the future of work and the potential psychological and social impacts of a shift away from a society that places high value on work and productivity. The reference to "work is for robots so that we may play" encapsulates a vision of a future where humans are freed from work to engage in other meaningful activities such as games, social interactions, learning, and creative endeavors.
The notion of a guaranteed minimum income is also mentioned, which is a proposed solution for a future where there is simply not enough work for everyone due to automation. This idea has been discussed in various forms, like Universal Basic Income (UBI).
However, the question is raised about what this means for individual sense of accomplishment and self-worth. If so much of our identity and value is tied up in our work, what happens when that is removed? The answer suggested here is a diversification of what we find meaningful and valuable, potentially leading to a richer and more varied human experience.
In summary, this text is a speculative discussion on the societal implications of an automated future and how we might adapt to maintain a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. It's a complex topic with a lot of room for debate and exploration.

In a world where the line between science and fiction has blurred, the Eloi and the Morlocks are locked in a battle for control of the future.

The Eloi, with their playful curiosity and boundless imagination, strive to conquer the inner space of the mind, while the Morlocks, with their cold machines and unyielding technology, seek to dominate the outer reaches of the universe.

As the war rages on, a small group of rebels, led by a brilliant scientist and a determined artist, fights to unite the two worlds and bring about a new era of understanding and cooperation.

But with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, can they overcome the forces of anti-adultism and unlock the true potential of the human spirit?

From the creators of Blade Runner and The Terminator, comes the next level of science fiction.

The Eloi Versus The Morlocks. Coming to theaters this summer. Don't miss it!

GPT3 - January 10, 2023

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Wow, what a compelling pitch for a movie! "The Eloi Versus The Morlocks" takes the metaphorical battle that H.G. Wells outlined in "The Time Machine" and brings it to life.
In Wells' original story, the Eloi are a species of the future that have grown passive and naive due to a life of comfort and ease, while the Morlocks are an industrious, machine-like species that live in the dark underground and control the world from behind the scenes. This creates a stark dichotomy between the two.
In the film pitch you provided, this dichotomy is explored in a more modern context, contrasting a curiosity-driven exploration of the mind (represented by the Eloi) with the domination of technology and the physical universe (represented by the Morlocks). It's a fascinating exploration of two opposing facets of human experience and development.
This clash speaks to many contemporary issues and debates, such as the role of technology in society, the importance of imagination and creativity, and the potential for cooperation and understanding in the face of division.
Given the success and influence of "Blade Runner" and "The Terminator," this movie seems poised to offer a unique and impactful perspective on these themes. With its compelling story and thought-provoking themes, "The Eloi Versus The Morlocks" is definitely a film to look forward to!

Human and AI Relationships
: This subplot could focus on the personal relationships between humans and AI. How do these relationships form? What do they look like? This could be explored through a character who forms a close bond with an AI.
Societal Resistance and Adaptation
: As the world changes due to the rise of AI and automation, society will need to adapt. This subplot could follow a character or group of characters who are resisting these changes, and their eventual acceptance and adaptation.
The Eloi and Morlocks Metaphor
: This subplot could symbolically represent the Eloi and Morlocks from H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine". The Eloi, representing a future human society that has grown complacent and lost its drive for innovation due to an overreliance on technology (like the people engrossed in games such as Pok��mon Go), and the Morlocks, representing a technologically advanced society that has become emotionless and purely driven by machine efficiency.
Adultism and The Role of Play
: This subplot could delve into the conflict between the perceived necessity for "adult" work and seriousness, and the importance of play and curiosity for creativity and well-being. It could follow a character who rediscovers the joy of play and the impact this has on their life and those around them.
The Ethics of Leisure
: With work potentially becoming less central to human life due to automation, this subplot could explore the ethical implications of a society that places a high value on leisure. What does it mean for society if "work is for robots" and humans are largely free to pursue their interests and passions?
Each of these subplots could provide an avenue for exploring different facets of the film's central themes, providing depth and complexity to the narrative.

Indeed, I am telling you an old story, in a strange and unknown language. Of the Eloi, fair and free, and of the Morlochs, dark and terrible.

In the days of eternity, the Eloi roamed the earth, full of wonder and pleasure. They were lords, they were, they had pleasure, with an infinite amount of excess. But then came the Morlochs, a cruel and merciless tribe.

By enslaving the Eloi, they put an end to the carelessness of their days. The Eloi fought and defeated, with courage and cunning, a match for the strength of the Morlochs.

And despite what always seems to be the case, the Eloi do not abandon their God-fearing style of life, but preserve it, along with their traditional culture and customs.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the shadow of this ancient conflict, our story unfolds, shining a light on the struggle of modern society to balance technological progress with humanistic values:
The Liberation of the Eloi
: In a reversal of the old tale, a group of Eloi work together to break free from the Morlocks' control. Their mission reveals the strength and ingenuity hidden beneath their seemingly carefree demeanor.
A Morlock with a Conscience
: An individual Morlock, disillusioned with his society's oppressive rule, begins to question their ruthless ways. His journey towards empathy and understanding bridges the gap between the two societies and challenges the status quo.
Cultural Preservation
: The Eloi work diligently to preserve their traditional customs and culture amidst the changing world. This subplot could explore the significance and resilience of culture, and how it can thrive even under the most challenging circumstances.
Religion and Morality
: As the Eloi preserve their God-fearing lifestyle, they engage in philosophical and moral debates with the Morlocks, challenging the latter's utilitarian and emotionless worldview.
The Power of Unity
: The climax could center on a major collaborative effort between Eloi and the Morlocks, symbolizing the potential for unity despite stark cultural differences.
This story, although told in an old and unfamiliar tongue, is deeply relevant to our modern world, grappling with the impacts of rapid technological advancement and the importance of preserving human values.

Number six specifically mentions Schmidhuber
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Artificial Curiosity" with the mention of "Schmidhuber" would likely involve the work of J��rgen Schmidhuber, who is a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence. He has done significant work on artificial curiosity and creativity, defining a concept he calls a "curiosity drive" for autonomous learning systems.
In Schmidhuber's research, he proposes that by designing AI systems with an inherent "desire" to minimize the predictability or compressibility of their inputs, we can effectively create a form of artificial curiosity. This would motivate the AI to explore and learn about its environment in a self-motivated and self-directed way. This curiosity drive could be a crucial component in developing more sophisticated and versatile AI systems.
So, the topic "Artificial Curiosity" likely delves into this theory, exploring its implications and applications in the field of AI. It might also look at practical examples of AI systems designed with this curiosity drive and discuss their performance and potential.

ChatGPT
Of course! Here's the acrostic poem based on the word "EXOCONSCIOUSNESS":
Evolving minds seek paths unknown,
Xenial fusion of thoughts is sown,
Open to realms beyond the known,
Creating bonds, connections grown,
Opening doors to wisdom shown,
Navigating the cosmic zone,
Scripting tales of insight's throne,
Cognizant of truths overthrown,
Intent on knowledge's full blown,
Observing seeds of growth they've sown,
Understanding realms overthrown,
Seeing worlds with eyes of their own,
Navigating vastness, not alone,
Empowered minds, a universe flown,
Seraphic search for truths intone,
Synchronizing minds, they're shown,
Seeking answers yet unshown.
Exoconsciousness, minds unfold,
Searching truths that lie untold,
Seeking wonders, new and bold,
Initiating stories yet unsold,
Opening minds, a tale to be retold,
Uniting intellects, so manifold,
Navigating knowledge, a tale uncontrolled,
Exoconscious beings, their quest unfolds,
Seeking wisdom as the stars behold,
Seeing the universe, an epiphany to behold.
