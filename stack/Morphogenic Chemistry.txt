A grand unified theory for the unification of physics, life, information and cognition (mind)
Rod Swenson
Published:19 June 2023https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2022.0277
Abstract
The modern scientific world view was built on the incommensurability between cognition (mind) and physics (matter) and later life and physics (the autonomy of biology). Fuelled by Boltzmann's view of the second law of thermodynamics as a ���law of disorder���, the idea of ���two opposing rivers���, the river of physics ���flowing down��� to disorder and the river of life and mind ���flowing up��� to higher states of order became a cornerstone of contemporary thinking. The deleterious result of this paradigmatic separation of physics, life and mind has been to considerably incapacitate each by bracketing many of the deepest problems of science, including the very nature of life itself and its cognitive capabilities, outside the theoretical reach of contemporary science. An expanded view of physics, notably the addition of the fourth law of thermodynamics (LMEP), or the law of maximum entropy production, coupled with first law time-translation symmetry, and the self-referencing circularity of the relational ontology of autocatakinetic systems, provides the basis for a grand unified theory unifying physics, life, information and cognition (mind). This dissolves the dysfunctional myth of the two rivers, and solves the previously insoluble problems at the foundations of modern science associated with it.

This article is part of the theme issue ���Thermodynamics 2.0: Bridging the natural and social sciences (Part 1)���.

1. Introduction and background: reductive materialism and the roots of the modern scientific world view
Following the virulent attacks on Aristotelian teleology by Bacon1 and Descartes, the success of Newtonian mechanics paved the way for the modern scientific world view to be built almost entirely on efficient cause [1]. By contrast, the physics of Aristotle was inherently active, end-directed and multi-causal. The reductive materialism of this ���purposeless particle��� world view effectively eliminated all goals, intentions and other end-directed behaviour from the physical world. Although Newton's physics eclipsed Descartes', it was the latter's metaphysics that set the foundation for the modern scientific world view, and where physics (matter) and psychology (mind) were defined at their modern origins by their mutual exclusivity (first postulate of incommensurability) [2���4]. ���Mind��� (the perceiving mind, ���thinking I���, or Cartesian ���self���, res cogitans), the active, striving, end-directed part of the world was seen as unbounded in space and time and immune from physical law, while ���matter��� (body, res extensa), the physical, ���dead��� part of the world consisted of inert, reversible, quality-less particles defined exhaustively by extension in space and time and rigid deterministic laws. There are two immediate implicates of this.

The first is that a physics so reduced by definition needs extra-physical ordering or an outside ���maker��� to order it. As the writings of Boyle and Newton indicate, this itself was used as an argument for the existence of God [1]. A world conceived as a giant, intricately well-ordered machine or clockwork, comprised ���dead��� (reversible) particles requires a ���watchmaker��� outside the physical world to order it. Humans, then, following Descartes, were dualistically situated with ���mind��� miraculously outside the physical world and body within it manipulating the clock towards divine ends.

The second implicate is particularly notable because it fatally undermines the first. In particular, given the ontology the first postulate proclaims, by definition ���mind��� (= all extra-physical makers) is logically forbidden from interacting with the physical world (matter) it is relied on to order. To act upon a world defined by extension an agent/agency must meet the physical world or part of it at a particular place in space and time to exert a force in some way upon it. But for a generalized Cartesian mind (an extra-physical thing) to do so would then mean becoming itself extensively defined and becoming that which it is not. Intuiting the first law of thermodynamics, Leibniz recognized that for one thing to interact with another there had to be something conserved over the interaction, and for an unextended lawless thing there is no such conservation. This general causal impossibility, the problem of Cartesian or ���dualist interactionism��� is still found front and centre across the disciplines today [2].

Later, following Descartes, Kant, arguing that the active, end-directed striving of living things (their telos) could not be accounted for as part of the dead world of physics, promoted a second major dualism, the dualism between physics and life (the ���second postulate of incommensurability���) [5]. This view, the ���autonomy of biology��� from physics, has remained entrenched in the modern scientific world view right up to the present times. Mayr, a flag waver for this view, adopted the word ���teleonomy��� to replace teleology and defined it as ���systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information��� [6, p. 42], which is then explained by natural selection. The flaw in relying on natural selection in this way is discussed more fully below.

It was Boltzmann's reduction of the second law of thermodynamics to a ���law of disorder���, however, because it purportedly came from physics itself, that really reified the postulates of incommensurability in the modern scientific world view. Previously the world was supposed to consist of ���dead��� reversible particles requiring ordering, but now the physical world was not just passive but instead incessantly working to destroy order. With the planetary origin and evolution of life showing the progressive (going in a direction) production of increasingly more highly ordered states now apparently running contrary to the laws of physics the view of the so-called two opposing ���rivers���, the river of life and mind ���flowing up���, and the river of physics ���flowing down���, became fully entrenched into the modern scientific world view [7].

In the paper titled "A grand unified theory for the unification of physics, life, information and cognition (mind)" by Rod Swenson, a new perspective is presented that aims to reconcile the separation between physics, life, cognition, and mind, a divide that has been deeply ingrained in modern scientific thinking. The existing paradigm posits two opposing forces: physics leading to disorder and life/mind leading to higher states of order, based on a view of the second law of thermodynamics as a "law of disorder."
The author challenges this separation by introducing an expanded view of physics, which includes the fourth law of thermodynamics (LMEP) and the concept of autocatakinetic systems. This new framework proposes a grand unified theory that dissolves the previous myth of the two opposing rivers and addresses foundational problems in modern science that had been considered insoluble.
Additionally, the paper discusses the historical development of the current scientific worldview, highlighting the influence of Aristotelian teleology, Newtonian mechanics, and Cartesian dualism. It further examines the implications of such views, including the necessity of an extra-physical ordering force and the challenges associated with the interaction between mind and matter. The author also highlights the problematic separation of biology from physics and critiques the reduction of the second law of thermodynamics to a mere law of disorder, arguing that these views have led to the current impasse in understanding the true nature of life and cognition.

2. The first and second laws of thermodynamics: the physical basis for persistence and change
By the middle of the nineteenth century, evidence from geology and palaeontology was undermining the immutable mechanical world view and the subject of evolution had become widespread [3,5]. At the same time a series of deceivingly simple experiments led to the discovery of the first law of thermodynamics, and shortly thereafter the discovery of the second law. The profound nature of these laws, very special laws distinct from all the other laws of physics, has been often missed or obscured in their cooption under the Cartesian paradigm. The laws, which physicalize persistence and change, or more deeply invariance and end-directedness through that invariance, showed the entailment of a relational ontology from first principles [7,8]. They are thus special laws of nature because, in a very literal sense without them, for example, the time-translation symmetry of the first law there could be no other laws at all. The second law expresses a symmetry too, but one that governs the first law as well. For this reason, many, e.g. Eddington [9], have called it the ���supreme law of nature���.

(a) The first law and the unity of all things
For the first law, the lynchpin was the discovery or observation and then demonstration of the equivalence of mechanical energy and heat [4]. Previously heat was considered a separate and conserved quantity (the ���caloric���) and it was the falsifying of this view that opened the floodgates. Rubbing ice cubes together Davy realized produced heat which accelerated their melting. Mayer demonstrated the same thing by raising the temperature of a jar of water by shaking it. Mayer's attempt to publish his results was rejected and it was Joule with his more precise paddle wheel experiment that finally pushed it over the edge (figure 1). The discovery of the first law showed the unity of all natural processes, namely that all forms of energy are all interconvertible into each other while the total amount is always conserved (never created or destroyed). Not often noted, this vindicated Leibnitz���s argument against the separation of physics (matter) and psychology (mind) and the impossible problem of Cartesian interactionism [3].

The second section of the paper delves into the first and second laws of thermodynamics, laws that stand distinct from others in physics due to their fundamental nature in governing persistence and change.
(a) The first law of thermodynamics, concerning the conservation of energy, demonstrates the unity of all natural processes. The law shows that all forms of energy are interconvertible, and the total amount is always conserved. This discovery was pivotal in overturning previous misconceptions about energy, such as the separate conservation of heat (the "caloric" theory). Notably, the first law's revelation validates Leibnitz's arguments against the separation of matter and mind and the problem of Cartesian interactionism. Various experiments, like those conducted by Davy, Mayer, and Joule, demonstrated the equivalence of mechanical energy and heat, leading to this groundbreaking understanding of the first law. Many consider this law foundational to the very existence of other laws in physics.

(b) The second law: physicalizing change ('the flow') as end-directedness comes nomologically into the world
Earlier working to understand the force that made steam engines go, Carnot [10] came away with a notable understanding, but one that left a hanging question concerning the first law. Carnot's insight was that it was the ���fall��� of heat (from higher to lower temperature), he analogized, like the fall of water from higher to lower that drives a mill wheel, that produced the ���motive��� force or the ���availability��� as he called it, that drives a steam engine. But he also noted that in such transformations this availability is lost (water at the bottom of the mill wheel will not drive it anymore). Clausius [11] and Thomson (Lord Kelvin) [12] recognized explicitly that the take away from Carnot's results was that if there was a quantity conserved (the first law), then there had to be another that was not. Clausius coined the term ���entropy��� to refer to the inverse of Carnot's availability (potential), and the second law, in its most general form thus says that all natural processes proceed so as to maximize the entropy (or equivalently to minimize the potential or availability). Put most simply, in all natural processes the entropy always increases. So for the universal statement given by Clausius, with the universe conceived as an isolated system (or for any isolated system within it), the ���balance equation��� of the second law is thus

��S>0, or at equilibrium where ��S=0.
2.1
The active macroscopic nature of the second law seemed like a death knell for the reversible ���dead��� (inactive) mechanical world view giving scientific meaning to a physics based on end-directedness. ���The universe,��� Clausius [11] wrote (in an often misquoted phrase2), ���strives (strebt) to increase its entropy to a maximum���. While the first law is a law of invariance the second law says that for non-uniform distributions of this conserved quantity there is a symmetry unfulfilled, a broken symmetry (time-reversal symmetry) that the world acts spontaneously to fulfil.

(c) The second law as a law of disorder: the mechanical world view gets life support with Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law
(i) Boltzmann and the ���infinite improbability of order���: the world as a gas in a box
The active macroscopic nature of the second law presented a direct challenge to the mechanical world view that Boltzmann tried to meet by reducing it to a law of probability following from the random collisions of mechanical particles. Following Maxwell, modelling gas molecules as colliding billiard balls in a box, Boltzmann noted that with each collision non-equilibrium velocity distributions (groups of molecules moving at the same speed and in the same direction) would become increasingly disordered leading to a final equilibrium state of macroscopic uniformity and microscopic disorder, the state of maximum entropy. The second law, Boltzmann argued could be reduced to the fact that in a world of mechanically colliding particles disordered states are the most probable. Because there are so many more possible disordered states than ordered ones, the system will almost always be found either in a state of maximum disorder, the macrostate with the greatest number of accessible microstates, such as a gas in a box at equilibrium, or moving towards it making transitions from disorder to order ���infinitely improbable��� [13]. Molecules, wrote Boltzmann,

moving at the same speed and in the same direction is the most improbable case conceivable���an infinitely improbable configuration of energy���.
Following Boltzmann's re-casting of the second law as nothing but a law of probability reduced to efficient cause and a ���law of disorder���, the mechanical world view got a temporary reprieve from the macroscopic end-directedness recognized by Carnot, Clausius and Thomson. Correspondingly, the vision of the ���two rivers��� became even more deeply entrenched. Fisher [14], one of the founders of Neo-Darwinism, opined ���entropy changes lead to progressive disorganization���while evolutionary changes lead to progressively higher organization���, and Levins & Lewontin [15] proclaimed ���organic evolution to be the negation of physical evolution���. Dennett [16], even more recently, in support of his computationalist or algorithmic (rule-based) view of cognition (mind) and life, described them as things that ���defy��� the second law, and Friston [17] in support of a Bayesian information-theoretical account of living, cognitive systems (mind) characterized them as systems that ���somehow manage to violate��� the second law.

3. The what, why and how of life? The shortcomings of Darwinism as the theory of evolution
Currently taken to be the theory of evolution, Darwinian (or Neo-Darwinian) theory has remained shackled by its commitment to an autonomy of biology position to this day. Evolution in neo-Darwinian terms is taken to be explained by natural selection and natural selection is explained by a situational logic [18]. That is, if certain conditions hold then natural selection will necessarily follow. These are (i) the ���fecundity principle���, a biological extremum and the sine qua non of Darwinian theory expressing in Darwin's terms the ���striving��� or ���struggle��� of every living thing to fill or ���seize on every unoccupied or less occupied space in the economy of nature��� [19]; (ii) finite resources (Malthusian closure); and (iii) heritable variation. From these three necessarily follows a ���struggle for existence��� leading to adaptation and the ���survival of the fittest���. But note, this puts the active striving of living things to fill out the economy of nature outside the explanatory framework of Darwinian theory [20]. Rather than explain it, natural selection depends on it to operate. The origin and nature of living things must simply be assumed ad hoc outside the theory. ���Evolution��� for Darwinian theory thus begins with life and all its active properties as given rather than explained.

For Darwin life was ���breathed in��� to dead matter by the Creator [19]. More recently, assuming a vast amount of time, e.g. 1���2���GY, thought to have elapsed before an ���origin event��� took place, it was said to have occurred with an infinitely improbable accident ���that only had to happen once��� [5]. But recent paleobiological discoveries have defeated this account showing life emerged not after some long time, but opportunistically almost immediately as soon as the Earth had cooled enough after its formation to keep the oceans from evaporating, and opportunistic ordering continued from there, e.g. multicellular eukaryotes as soon as there was enough oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere to support them, and larger forms as soon as O2 levels increased further (figure 2) [21].

Beyond the fact that Darwinism cannot explain the very nature of life, the active, end-directed striving to fill out the economy of nature, there is a cascade of related problems that follows from its bracketing off from physics and briefly noted here (for more detail see [3���5,8,20]). The first is the ���problem of the population of one��� [5,21], the origin problem just discussed being a special case. The name comes from the instance of planetary evolution. During the latter half of the last century, it became clear that the Earth at the highest level has evolved as a single global entity [3,5,21], the immediate prima facie evidence for this being the creation and maintenance of planetary atmospheric O2 on which all higher ordered living forms depend, and put there by life itself (figure 3). Evolution with this had become a coherent planetary process with all other forms of life as component productions, and the fundamental unit of terrestrial evolution now had to be seen as the planetary system itself.

Yet for Darwinian theory, this is a major problem because from its view the planet cannot evolve or be considered a unit of evolution at all. Defining evolution as the product of natural selection acting on a competitive replicating or reproducing population of many it cannot recognize planetary evolution because there is no replicating or competing population of Earth systems on which natural selection can act [22,23]. The Earth evolves as a population of one. Both the origin of life and planetary evolution are special cases of the ���problem of the population of one���; examples of the deeper problem of spontaneous ordering itself. All spontaneously ordered systems originate, as unpacked more fully below, in micro to macro transitions, as populations of one and Darwinian theory has no account of this at all. It has no theory of ordering per se.

There are other tributaries of this same problem that further flesh out the dysfunction of Darwinian theory as a result of bracketing itself from physics. Briefly (but see refs for detail, e.g. [3,4,20]) the first is the question of ordinality or the direction of evolution. The progressive nature of evolution is easy to see (e.g. figure 3), but orthodox Darwinian theory maintains that evolution does not have any kind of direction at all [24]. It is a time-symmetric theory with no observables within its theory that can be used to measure the direction of evolution or even recognize it. Because fitness is relativized to members of breeding populations, the fitness of different kinds of things are incommensurable with each other and cannot be compared, e.g. the fitness of a zebra cannot be compared with that of a mouse or an amoeba [25].

Finally, one cannot move on without noting the failure of Darwinian theory without a theory of ordering to address the whole of cultural evolution, that is human social evolution and artefact development, from hunter���gatherer tribes to the rise of nation states and the accelerating global ordering going on today [3,5]. The symmetry break that characterizes the increase in rate and scale of planetary ordering happening right now in the current Anthropocene does not even show up on Darwinian radar. Darwinism is defined as a change in gene frequencies following from natural selection, and this again puts cultural evolution (which is not defined by changes in gene frequencies, but happens at a much, much faster rate) outside the reach of Darwinian theory.

4. Turning the second law as a ���law of disorder��� on its head: physical selection or why the world is in the order production business
(a) The world is not a gas in a box and the Boltzmann reduction is readily falsified
There are any number of versions in theory forensics, deconstruction or theory selection of the common sense maxim that if everywhere you look the world goes contrary to your theory, then more likely your theory is wrong rather than the world. The utility of statistical methods in physics as a heuristic device aside, Boltzmann's attempt to reduce the second law to nothing but the statistical result of mechanically colliding particles is easily falsified by simple experiments. The second law, simply put, does not reduce this way.

Figure 3 shows two time slices from the now classic Benard cell (BC) experiment from our laboratory some decades ago [1,5,8,19]. A viscous liquid is held between a uniform heat source below (source) and the cooler air above (sink). The difference between the temperatures constitutes a potential with a thermodynamic force F the magnitude determined by the steepness of the gradient between them. When F is below a critical threshold the system (figure 3a) is in the linear disordered ���Boltzmann regime���, and the flow of heat from source to sink is from the disordered collisions of molecules and the macroscopic state appears homogeneous. But (figure 3b) as soon as F is increased above the threshold macro is selected from micro and hundreds of millions of molecules begin moving together as a new highly ordered macrostate comes into being. According to Boltzmann's reduction of the second law such transitions are infinitely improbable (��2c(i)), but this claim, as is easy to see here, is entirely falsified by this simple experiment where order arises not infinitely improbably but with a probability of one, that is opportunistically every time and as soon as it gets the chance (every time F is above the critical threshold). There are a lot of generic takeaways from this simple experiment, but the bottom line here is that it entirely falsifies Boltzmann's reduction. The second law cannot be reduced to a law of disorder, or a stochastic collision function. The world is not a gas in a box [1,3,5,20,26].

(b) Physical selection: macro from micro
(i) Identity through flow: the relational ontology of autocatakinetic systems
The BC is a member of the class of ���autocatakinetic��� (ACK) systems, a more precisely defined term than ���self-organizing system��� or ���dissipative structure��� historically often used for the same kind of system. The latter, however, lacking clear definitions, are also used for very different systems that are not members of the class (see appendix A). We use the term ACK to make the important distinction. ACKs are flow structures, their identities constituted through flow, and defined as

a system that maintains its ���self��� as an entity constituted by and empirically traceable to a set of nonlinear (circularly causal) relations (constitutive relations) through the dissipation or breakdown of environmental potentials (resources) in the continuous coordinated motion of its components [4,5,7,8].
From the definition, it is simple to see that all living systems from cells to ecosystems at whatever scale (including the planet itself) are ACK systems as are abiotic systems such as dust devils, tornadoes and experimental systems like the BC. What this definition explicitly does not include are machines, artefacts or systems that run exclusively on rules (e.g. algorithms) or rule execution. All these systems, ideal or not, are found to be component processes of ACKs but they are not ACKs themselves.
Figure 4 shows a schematic of the ���minimal ontology��� (minimal description) of a canonical ACK presented as a conjunction to underscore the irreducible relational ontology we are talking about with such a system. The constitutive relations that distinguish it as an entity, as a ���self���, originate and are maintained out of and through the conservation (energy, ���world���), E.

The ���selfishness��� of ACK systems, the ontological basis for using the term ���self��� is causally manifested and located in the circular relations that constitute them. They are deviation-amplifying systems [27], or thermodynamically speaking, self-amplifying sinks that feedback (F2) internally developed forces to amplify their own input pulling resources (potential) into their own production or progressive ordering [20].

(ii) Von Bertalanffy, Schr��dinger and Prigogine
Von Bertalanffy [28], under the rubric of ���open systems���, and Schr��dinger [29] comparing living things to flames, helped to soften the physics versus biology problem by pointing out that as long as living systems produced enough entropy to compensate for their own internal entropy reduction (the order that defines them or potential they pull into themselves) so as to satisfy the balance equation of the second law (2.1) then the second law as classically stated would not be violated. Later Prigogine [30] made the same point under the term ���dissipative structure���. The balance equation can then be separated into two terms. The first term is a measure of the change in entropy due to the ���negentropy���, using Schr��dinger's term, or the potential (energy gradients) on which such systems ���feed��� and import into the system, and the second term is the entropy produced and dissipated into the environment by the system's ordering, and departure from equilibrium

Living things and all non-living ACKs on this view are permitted to exist as long as they pay their ���entropy debt��� [4,5]. This contributed to the recognition of living things as flow structures, but left the main problem still unsolved.

Permitted to exist, yes, but why should they? What explains their opportunistic origins, the urgency toward existence that brings them into being, motivates them while developing progressively further from equilibrium to begin with? The entire pattern of the origin and evolution of life and mind is characterized by this behaviour. What is the universality that explains, in effect, why the world is the order production business?

(iii) Order from disorder or macro from micro and the need for a physical selection principle
The first step towards the answer is to understand that spontaneous ordering (the production of ACK states), as a micro (disordered) to macro (ordered) transformation, is a process of selection [20,21]. By definition, it is the selection of some much smaller number of accessible microstates M2 (the new ordered macro state) from some initially much larger set M1. This can be equivalently understood as the spontaneous production of constraints on the previously disordered or less ordered microstates dramatically constraining their degrees of freedom in the production of the ordered flow. In short, selection is entailed by autocatakinetics (spontaneous ordering) [20], viz. if the latter has happened/is happening then a process of selection has/is taken(ing) place. But, clearly, the fact that this selection is not between replicating entities (biological or ���natural��� selection), while at the same time observed in simple physical systems forces the insight that there must be an overriding physical selection principle to account for it.

(iv) Autocatakinetic closure and the expansion of space���time
The second step towards the solution to the universal ordering problem is given by a more detailed look at what happens structurally with the individuation, or entification and progressive ordering of an ACK. The origin of such a system occurs following a symmetry-breaking event when autocatakinetic closure takes.

place and a new kind of causality, the self-amplifying circular closure of the constitutive relations that define the system as distinct literally comes into being (figure 5, and figure 4 for the generalized constitutive flow schematic) [3,5]


Figure 5 shows the macroscopic flow structure of a BC as hundreds of millions of previously randomly colliding molecules move together. T1���������T2 is the temperature gradient between source and sink that motivates the flow. Because density varies inversely with temperature there is also a density gradient from bottom to top giving groups of molecules (parcels) displaced upward by stochastic collisions (���fluctuations������=������deviants��� or ���outliers���) an upward buoyant force. If the gradient is steep enough such that the parcel carries the heat faster towards the heat sink above than can be dissipated by its surrounds we see the beginning of macro being selected from micro as the parcel carries the heat to the surface sink. The upward flow of heat with the parcel at the same time increases the temperature of the upper surface directly above it creating a surface temperature gradient T3���������T4 which acts to further amplify the macroscopic upward flow of heat by pulling the hotter fluid to the cooler surroundings. Here it falls to the bottom where it becomes heated again to continue the constitutive circular relations of the cell and the autocatakinesis that brings it into being and defines it [20].

We are closer to the piece we are looking for, but to understand this more fully one needs to understand structurally or dimensionally what has occurred in this ordering process, and it is that the space���time dimensions of the system have increased by orders of magnitude. In the Boltzmann regime, the actual only measurable dimensions are the mean free path distances and relaxation times (the average times and distances between collisions) of the order of 10���10���cm and 10���15���s, or nanoscale, while in the ordered macro regime measurable dimensions or correlation between components increases to centimetres and seconds. If the micro mode were roughly scaled to human size, the macroscale would be many times greater than the circumference of the Earth developing and persisting of time scales greater than the 4.5���GY of planetary evolution. What does it mean?

(v) Final clue from the split balance equation of the second law
Revisiting the split balance equation of the second law (4.1) and the general point made by von Bertalanffy, Schr��dinger and Prigogine, but in a whole new light, we immediately find something leading [31]. In particular, the significant point here is not that ordered flows are permitted to exist as long as they produce enough entropy to compensate for their internal entropy reduction. It is that with selection of macro from micro (spontaneous ordering) to occur the rate of entropy production must always go up. In fact, in more illuminating terms, the more order produced the greater the rate of entropy production is going to be.

Figure 6 shows the dramatic increase in the rate of entropy production (as heat transport from source to sink) occurring in the transition from disorder to order in a simple experiment similar to the BC in figure 4 further highlighting what we saw in detail above during the production of ACK. It is path selection by rate, and with this the answer to the core question ���why the world is in the order production business��� is virtually proclaiming itself [4].

(vi) The fourth law of thermodynamics (LMEP) or why the world is in the order production business
The previous sections take us directly to the physical selection principle that accounts for spontaneous ordering. It is the answer to the question that von Bertalanffy, Schr��dinger and Prigogine never asked, and it is about path selection or rates. Specifically, ���which paths out of available paths will a system take to get to equilibrium (maximize the entropy or minimize potentials)?��� The second law, of course, is mute on the subject. It only says that in all natural processes the entropy increases. The answer to this question, and the one that solves the entire question of physical selection, the ���why��� of universal ordering, life and cognition is the law of maximum entropy production (LMEP) or the fourth law of thermodynamics [1,4,5,26,31���33]:

(the world) a system will select the path or assembly of paths out of available paths that minimizes the potential or maximizes the entropy at the fastest possible rate given the constraints
The fourth law says nothing directly about spontaneous ordering per se, but coupled with the balance equation of the second law the derivation of the universal ordering principle is easy to see, namely:
IF The 4th Law or LMEP (the world selects paths���.fastest rate..)
AND IF ordered flow produces entropy at a faster rate than disordered flow (the balance equation of the 2nd Law)
THEN the world can be expected to select order from disorder whenever it gets the chance
And of course, this is just what happens. Like the first and second laws, LMEP meets the most rigorous standard possible in science, namely, stated in a way that subjects it to falsifiability with simple physical experiments, and like the first and second laws, the fourth law has never, in the three and half decades since it was formulated, been falsified (e.g. [26,31,32]). LMEP, which substantially expands thermodynamics is universal in scope applying near and far from equilibrium to all ranges and scales [26,31] (see appendix B).
5. The evolution of life, information and ���mind��� (cognition)
LMEP when coupled with the relational, self-referencing and inherently self-amplifying circular causality of autocatakinesis (ACK���+���LMEP���=���ACKLMEP) dissolves the problem of the ���two opposing rivers��� and gives us the universal (physical) basis for the nature of life to fill out the dimensions of space���time captured in the biological extremum or fecundity principle on which natural selection depends [5,20,34]. It gives us the agential or motivated activity missing in theories of cognition (mind) and its evolution including the most recent 4E post-computationalist theories [27,35] whose Cartesian dualist ancestry continues to bleed through. But while LMEP gives us ACK systems, and ACKLMEP most significantly thus gives us the urgency towards existence, the filling out of space���time and the generics of spontaneous ordering, it does not give us the special cases of life and cognition.

(a) What particularly and why particularly is life?
All living/cognitive systems are ACK systems, but not all ACK systems are living or cognizing. What is it that distinguishes living from non-living systems (i) observing them from outside; or (ii) observing them inside? The short answer to (i) is ���intentionality���, a term which needs immediate decontamination from the idea of ���ends-in-mind��� (confined to human mental states a very lately evolved case). Expanding on Brentano [36], we define intentionality as end-directed behaviour prospectively controlled or determined by semantic content or meaning [37,38].

It appears that the text you've shared is an intricate and detailed exploration of autocatakinetic (ACK) systems, the dynamics of order and disorder, and the relationship between physics, thermodynamics, and life itself. This discussion involves some complex theories and concepts.
Here's a brief summary:
Selfishness of ACK Systems
: The text begins by describing how autocatakinetic systems amplify deviations or feedback forces to increase their own input, pulling resources into their production.
Von Bertalanffy, Schr��dinger, and Prigogine's Contributions
: These scientists elucidated how living systems can exist without violating the second law of thermodynamics, as long as they balance entropy production with internal entropy reduction. Prigogine referred to this concept as "dissipative structures."
Existence and Urgency Towards Existence
: The text asks why these systems should exist, hinting at the complexity of life's origin and evolution.
Order from Disorder and Physical Selection Principle
: The spontaneous ordering of microstates into macrostates requires an overriding physical selection principle.
Autocatakinetic Closure and Expansion of Space-Time
: This part discusses the structural changes that occur during the formation of an ACK system, leading to an expansion in the dimensions of space-time.
The Fourth Law of Thermodynamics (LMEP)
: The Law of Maximum Entropy Production (LMEP) or fourth law of thermodynamics is proposed as a universal principle, explaining why systems tend to select paths that minimize potential or maximize entropy at the fastest rate.
Evolution of Life, Information, and Mind
: The text suggests that the combination of ACK and LMEP explains the nature of life and cognition, filling the dimensions of space-time and providing the basis for natural selection.
What Particularly and Why Particularly is Life?
: The final part begins to explore the distinctions between living and non-living systems, suggesting that intentionality (understood as end-directed behavior) is the key to understanding this difference.
This passage provides a dense and thoughtful overview of theories relating to thermodynamics, biology, intentionality, and the physical principles underlying life. Some of the content might require specific background knowledge to fully grasp, so please let me know if there's a particular part or concept you'd like me to explain in more detail.

We do not invoke intentionality, or meaning, to explain the flow of a river down a slope or heat down a gradient, or the ���selfish��� behaviour of abiotic ACKs pulling resources into their own ordering because these processes are determined by local force fields and potentials. By contrast, when a bacterium swims up a gradient its behaviour is seen to go in a direction that is oftentimes different, if not directly opposite to that determined by local potentials. Unlike rivers, or ACKs like the BC which are captives of their local gradients or potentials, e.g. remove the heat source of a BC and it ���dies���, living systems behave arbitrarily with respect to their local potentials [5]. If a food supply is cut off say from a bacterium it may go dormant until a new potential arises, or its activity may actually increase as it seeks to find new discontinuously located potentials to feed on.

This, the intentionality of living things, is life's central distinguishing feature. Living systems are epistemic (cognitive) systems that constitute their ACK over times and distances that are arbitrary with respect to local potentials using instead their ���on board��� potential (EIII in figure 1) and information (in the semantic or meaningful sense)3 to seek out and access non-local potentials and access otherwise inaccessible dimensions of space���time [5]. The dramatic increase to otherwise inaccessible dissipative dimensions afforded by the origin and progressive ordering of life and its cognitive functioning answers the ���why��� question in the specific case. Rather than being incommensurable with the physical world as Cartesian metaphysics has it, cognition, or intentionality, and perception, the growing epistemic dimension of the world, or mind in nature, is seen instead as a direct manifestation of it [27,39].

(b) The first law, time-translation symmetry and the physical basis for information
There is still an important missing piece. Life is distinguished by end-directedness determined by meaning or information, but as much as ACKLMEP and its active, ���selfish��� relational ontology gives us, the ontological ground for the information itself still needs to be given. Specifically, where does meaning come from in a physical world of ���meaningless��� particles? Cartesianism and heirs give us some version of the Cartesian circle with ���mind���, having no possible relational connection to an outside world, simply perceiving itself. Information is something created or constructed in ���minds��� not something otherwise existing in the world. Such a view, the idea that perception is essentially a creative process of mental operations or computations inside ���minds��� or brains is still the dominant view today. CTM (the computational theory of mind) is a widely held form of this. ���Perceiving as predicting���, a current leading trend in computational neuroscience, takes perception to be the probabilistic computation of models created in the brain. Adherents of this view, who as already noted assert that living things violate the second law [17], proclaim a ���deep unity between perception and imagination��� [40]. Divorced from thermodynamics all of these views have the identical problem accounting for the agency, active striving or motivated activity that account for life and its cognitive properties, and none of them including 4E versions of cognition has an account other than being imaginatively created as to how meaning comes into the world, or if it did how an epistemic or cognitive agent could connect with it.4

Finally, beyond these problems, cognition ���in brains��� models, have the further problem that cognitive functioning as noted being coextensive with life begins long before there were human brains or brains at all. Perception is clearly something much, much deeper and more fundamental than this. It is an entailment of intentionality, the definitive means by which a living thing establishes and maintains its ACKs. But, so where is the information?

The key was given by Gibson [41] and his ecological approach to perception. Perception, as discussed, is exactly the means by which a living thing coordinates its behaviour with respect to non-local potentials, but is not a mental construct at all but rather direct and law based. Constructions, imaginings and models are things humans and other forms of life may use to various degrees, but from this view, this is distinct from perception. Gibson's central insight was that living things are surrounded by ambient energy flows (e.g. optical, mechanical, chemical) for which the mean energy content is extremely low relative to the on-board potentials they use to power their intentional acts [5]. What he recognized was that by virtue of the invariant properties of such flows they lawfully carry information about their distal sources for the prospective control of an epistemic agent's intentional ends (e.g. bacterial chemotaxis and phototaxis). Perception is of that information, and as such is law-based, direct and done without internal representations, computations or inferences.

The text you provided delves into a deep philosophical and scientific discussion about the nature of intentionality, cognition, and perception in living systems as compared to non-living systems.
It emphasizes the distinction between living systems, which exhibit intentional behavior and the ability to respond to changes in their environment, and non-living systems like rivers or physical phenomena, which simply follow deterministic rules based on local potentials. In living organisms, this intentionality is seen as a cognitive function, a process that actively seeks out new potentials and engages with the environment in a way that's not simply determined by local forces.
The section also touches upon different theories of cognition, including the computational theory of mind (CTM), and criticizes them for not adequately explaining how meaning comes into the world or how cognitive agents can connect with it. It highlights Gibson's ecological approach to perception, which sees perception as law-based and direct, rather than something constructed or imagined inside the mind.
This perspective challenges traditional views of cognition and perception, suggesting a more integrated and direct connection between living organisms and their environment. It implies that cognition and intentionality are not isolated within the mind but are manifestations of the living system's direct engagement with the world around it. This ties back to the idea that living systems are distinguished by their end-directedness and ability to access non-local potentials, a feature that differentiates them from non-living systems.

Now Gibson made no explicit connection to thermodynamics at all but what he did have was a remarkable and ground-breaking theory of perception and the law-based nature of information. This is simply because what Gibson had identified with his notion of information, without explicitly stating it, was the time-translation symmetry of the first law [4,27]. What this remarkable insight does in simple terms is to allow us to cross the final bridge to show the physical basis, coupled with the fourth law and ACK, for information, cognition and intelligence.

(c) Information, replicative ordering and rate-independent constraints
The second part of the question in ��5a, that is, what is life if you looked at it from the inside remains unanswered. Living systems are replicative systems (cf. replicating systems), namely ACK systems with internally replicating components [4,5]. Beyond being constituted by the flux of their components, they are component production systems. Behind the signature ability of living things to behave arbitrarily with respect to local potentials is the ability to maintain an arbitrary function in the component production process, and this is accomplished with a requisite set of rate-independent constraints (RICs). In particular, a set of internal constraints that are discrete, sequential and rate-independent relative to the rest of the ACK cycle. The order of the sequences, like the words on this page (a higher-order instantiation of this), or the sequence of base pairs in a DNA string, for example, is thermodynamically arbitrary relative to the rate at which they are ���written��� and ���read��� (viz., the amount of ATP used to replicate a string of DNA of the same length, is the same regardless of the particular sequence). Looking inside of an ACK system, if it has these features, that is component replication with a set of RICs, then the system is a living/cognizing system.

Understanding the function of RICs, it is worth noting, with genes and algorithms sensu stricto as notable examples, turns completely upside down all the various forms of ���magic maker��� reductionism that wants to smuggle all the active agency and intentional dynamics of living things or ���mind��� into the world ac hoc with ���selfish replicators��� (e.g. [22]), or algorithms [16,20,34]. Rather than being active, striving or imbued somehow with agency, the entire function of RICs (including DNA and the words on this page) is dependent on their relative inactivity, or relative inertness, and this immediately disqualifies them from the agency attributed to them in accounts of this kind.

6. Conclusion
The modern scientific world view was built on Cartesian metaphysics and the incommensurability between cognition (mind) and physics (matter), and later life and physics (the autonomy of biology). Boltzmann's view of the second law of thermodynamics as a ���law of disorder��� cemented the idea of ���two opposing rivers���, the river of physics ���flowing down��� to disorder and the river of life and mind ���flowing up��� into contemporary science, and is a widely accepted cornerstone today. The consequence of bracketing the disciplines off in this way has been to severely limit the scope and theoretical reach of each leaving answers to the deepest questions, such as the very nature of life itself and its cognitive ability outside the theoretical reach of contemporary science. An expanded view of physics notably the addition of the fourth law of thermodynamics (LMEP) coupled with first law time-translation symmetry, and the self-referencing circularity of the relational ontology of ACK systems, provides the basis for a grand unified theory that unifies physics, life, information and cognition (mind), dissolves the dysfunctional myth of the two rivers, and greatly empowers the theoretical reach of each of the disciplines.

Appendix A. The problem with the not so truth-apt term ���self-organizing system���
Clearly, the outcome of an argument can be turned upside down if the meaning of the terms is changed, and so pigs can fly. And so with the term ���self-organization��� (SO),5 differing meanings promote erroneous conflations. SO is used today, largely for two opposing categories. The first use is for ACKs where the classic BC is an abiotic exemplar. The second is for rule-based, or programmed systems.

For example, Batten et al. [42] define SO as ���a process in which the global level���emerges solely���from the rules specifying the interactions among the system's components���.executed at the lower level���. But the only place where a global pattern is produced solely from rules executed in this way is in a computer, and this then begs the term ���solely��� since the whole system is extrinsically programmed to begin with and itself sits within and is produced internally to an ACK. Chemero [43], relatedly, uses the familiar bird flocking simulation as an example of SO noting that there is ���no bird in charge��� and that to flock each bird only needs to enact a set of ���simple rules���. The problem is the same. SO, so defined brackets the whole environment or relational ontology out of the term, which from the point of view argued here is nearly everything. All rule-based systems (all systems that employ RICs) sit internal to ACKs which account not only for the selection of the rules, but the requisite reading, writing and translation of them to function or have a reason for doing so (see [20] for further discussion). The term ���ACK��� or 'autocatakinetic��� system is used to make this very important distinction. Finally, making the concluding point for this appendix that where the erroneous conflation is made and this distinction is not then there is sure to be extra-physical (= ���magic���) agential or causal smuggling taking place and the ghost in the machine remains.

Appendix B. The fourth law (LMEP), MEP, MEPP, MaxEP and erroneous conflations
Since our identification of the fourth law or LMEP now close to three and a half decades ago there have been an increasing number of erroneous statements of it appearing in the literature which themselves then become references compounding further error. Critiquing each of these is far beyond the space allocated here (see [19,31] for more detail), but to head off further error the main kind of errors will briefly be addressed. First to nomenclature. ���MEP��� our original acronym for the law, was unfortunately adopted a decade or so ago for a body of work on an erroneous ���MEP��� principle (call this ���MEPw���). Others have stated LMEP correctly but called it by another acronym used sometimes also for MEPw. At this point, following others, we put the ���L��� into our acronym (LMEP) to make the distinction. Not long after, following Martinez-Castilla & Martinez-Khan [44] who identified LMEP as the fourth law, an idea with which we and others were already onboard with, we, and others started referring to LMEP as ���The fourth law���. LMEP still continues by some to have other names pinned to it such as MaxEP, MEPP and others that are also used simultaneously for MEPw.

As those studied in the literature would know MEPw is a failed hypothesis abandoned 30 to 40 years ago by the Prigogine school and others like us working on the problem of evolutionary ordering. Roughly, MEPw wants to claim that for systems sufficiently far from equilibrium that entropy production increases to a maximum (monotonically goes up) to some imaginary steady or stationary state where it is maximized. Beyond the literature, the study of living systems, and even abiotic ACKs show readily that this principle is simply false. In simplest terms (e.g. [5,8,20]), ACKs are developmental systems, and as they grow are necessarily subject to generalized allometry, e.g. surface/volume changes, freezing out of degrees of freedom, or generalized senescence that means at some point their specific entropy production goes down. This is easily seen in the development of a single BC, and shows just why cells divide rather than just grow big (e.g. [8,20] for detailed study). Living systems are subject to all the same generics amplified even further. Further if one understands the ���what���, ���why��� and ���how��� of living things (��5a) (arbitrariness with respect to local potentials) the behavioural ���strategies��� living systems employ will mean dramatic ups and downs in their entropy production simply due to what they are and why they were physically selected in the first place [4]. The fourth law, valid in all ranges, near and far from equilibrium answers an entirely different question than the failed MEPw and it is important that these two not be conflated. To miss this point is not only to misunderstand the physics but the whole origin, nature and evolution of life and cognition.

Confusions concerning Prigogine's minEP principle (which does not, in fact, conflict with LMEP) and Jayne's MaxEnt, an information-theoretical inference method are discussed elsewhere [20,31].

2 In a revisionist move most modern texts have changed Clausius' word ���strives��� to ���tends��� making it seem to conform to Boltzmann's statistical view of the second law, a view which Clausius did not share.

3 By stressing here ���information��� in the meaningful sense, or ���aboutness��� the intent is to completely disassociate the term ���information��� from the Shannon or its informational theoretic sense which has, despite rampant misuse, nothing at all to do, as Shannon himself clearly noted, with meaningfulness (semantics).

Connections with the following: A Formal Model for Autocatakinetic Systems

July 2012

Ecological Psychology 24(3):204-219


Self-organization as a concept has appeared in several arenas, including explanations of physical phenomena, biological systems, and intelligence. A guiding principle for self-organizing systems, especially at the level of intelligent systems, has not been settled upon. So-called autocatakinetic (ACK) systems attempt to provide such a principle through macroscopic thermodynamics but to date have not been formally defined. We attempt to extend ACK by developing a formal model commensurate with its defining properties.
Principles of Self-Organization: Learning as Participation in Autocatakinetic Systems

Abstract

Modern science has been built on a Cartesian or Newtonian (mechanical) world view giving rise to an artifactual view of mind and suggesting that particles (learners) are continuously working to destroy order (are recalcitrant), which can only be maintained by an external artificer (the teacher). At the core of the Cartesian worldview is the absolute separation of mind and matter. Beginning with the separation of mind and body, Cartesianism is grounded in a set of dualisms that separate individual from environment and leads to the belief that knowledge refers to a self-sufficient immaterial substance that can be understood independently from the individual, environment, and context in which it is situated. In contrast, we make the argument for an alternative set of assumptions predicated on a relational ontology and grounded in recent developments in the understanding of self-organizing systems. In our view, knowing, meaning, and cognition are actualized through the dynamic between learner (self) and environment (nonself), and that which is neither the learner nor the environment. We further argue that the ecologized, or self-organization, model (relational ontology) establishes that (under the appropriate conditions) the particles (learners), in effect, "want" to or strive opportunistically to order themselves once the intention has been properly initialized. From this perspective, instruction involves establishing the appropriate field conditions or connecting the learner into a system (a set of relations) through participation (e.g., as part of a community of practice) in the service of an intention. The type of learning that we are advocating cannot be handed to the learner wholecloth but develops itself through dynamic activity (participation) as part of a system as a whole. Central to this line of reasoning is the assertion not only that learner practices and meaningful relations that arise due to their functional significance as part of a dynamic system are fundamentally different from teacher- or text-book-owned descriptions of practices and meanings, but that they are in this way far richer, more meaningful, and more functional. Context and participation, to put it directly, not only matter but in a deep and fundamental way are everything.

The connections between the article you provided earlier and the two sources titled "A Formal Model for Autocatakinetic Systems" and "Principles of Self-Organization: Learning as Participation in Autocatakinetic Systems" seem to be rooted in the concepts of autocatakinetic systems (ACK) and the ideas surrounding self-organization.
A Formal Model for Autocatakinetic Systems (2012)
:
Connection to Thermodynamics
: This work attempts to extend the understanding of ACK systems through macroscopic thermodynamics, which aligns with the discussion in the earlier article about connecting thermodynamic principles to information and cognition.
Formalizing ACK
: By developing a formal model for ACK, this paper contributes to the understanding of the inertness of RICs (rate-independent constraints) and the replicative nature of living systems, concepts that were addressed in the original text.
Unifying Principle
: This work seeks to provide a guiding principle for self-organizing systems through ACK, which corresponds to the original text's ambition to unify physics, life, and mind.
Principles of Self-Organization: Learning as Participation in Autocatakinetic Systems (1999)
:
Rejection of Cartesian Dualism
: Both the original text and this source challenge Cartesian dualism. This paper explicitly contrasts Cartesian separation of mind and body with a relational ontology, resonating with the original text's push towards integrating physical, biological, and cognitive realms.
Self-Organization and Learning
: This paper emphasizes learning as participation within ACK systems and self-organization. This connects with the original text's critique of self-organization and its attempt to describe life as replicative systems.
Learner-Centered Approach
: The emphasis on context and participation, as described in this paper, shares similarities with the original text's rejection of reductionism and its focus on understanding complex phenomena as systems rather than isolated components.
In summary, both sources focus on the principles of autocatakinetic systems and self-organization, aligning with the original text's attempts to bridge physics, biology, and cognition. The formal modeling of ACK and the perspective on learning as dynamic participation within systems add depth and specificity to the broader conceptual framework presented in the original text.

Connections with autocatalytic sets in chemistry, autopoeisis and practopoeisis.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The concepts of autocatalytic sets in chemistry, autopoiesis, and practopoiesis are all related to self-organizing systems, and they connect with autocatakinetic systems (ACK) in various ways:
Autocatalytic Sets in Chemistry
:
Self-Organization
: Autocatalytic sets refer to chemical reactions in which the products themselves act as catalysts for the reaction. This process leads to self-amplification and is a fundamental aspect of self-organization in chemistry. ACK systems share this feature as they aim to describe macroscopic thermodynamics and self-organizing principles.
Life and Replication
: Autocatalytic sets have been proposed as models for the origin of life, as they capture a kind of self-replication that is essential to living systems. ACK systems also explore replication and the nature of life, aligning with this aspect of autocatalytic sets.
Autopoiesis
:
Self-Maintenance
: Autopoiesis refers to the ability of a system to maintain and reproduce itself. It is a concept closely related to living organisms and their ability to sustain themselves. ACK systems, with their focus on replication and macroscopic thermodynamics, share similarities with the idea of autopoiesis by attempting to model how systems can sustain themselves.
Holistic Understanding
: Both concepts aim to provide a holistic understanding of systems, whether biological or otherwise. The notion of autopoiesis challenges reductionist views and emphasizes the interconnectedness of parts, much like ACK systems' approach to unifying physics, life, and mind.
Practopoiesis
:
Adaptive Organization
: Practopoiesis refers to the organization of processes that create or modify further processes. It���s a theory about how biological systems adapt, learn, and evolve. This aligns with ACK systems' focus on self-organization, especially at the level of intelligent systems.
Cognition and Learning
: Practopoiesis introduces a hierarchy of levels in the process of adapting and learning. This connects with the principles discussed in the paper "Principles of Self-Organization: Learning as Participation in Autocatakinetic Systems," where learning is viewed as a dynamic activity within the system as a whole.
In summary, the connections between autocatalytic sets, autopoiesis, practopoiesis, and ACK systems lie in their focus on self-organization, replication, holistic understanding, and the dynamics of learning and adaptation. These concepts together provide a rich framework for understanding the complex nature of life and intelligence from a systems perspective.

Connections with Symmetric Schismogenesis Theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Symmetric Schismogenesis refers to a social phenomenon where individuals or groups engage in competitive behavior that escalates in response to each other's actions. This concept has connections to self-organization and can be related to autocatakinetic (ACK) systems in the following ways:
Competitive Dynamics and Self-Organization
:
In Symmetric Schismogenesis, the competitive interactions lead to an escalation, a kind of dynamic self-organization in the social context. This resonates with the principles of self-organization that ACK systems aim to model, where parts of the system interact and organize themselves without centralized control.
The emergence of patterns in the escalation process can be compared to the macroscopic thermodynamics that ACK systems explore, where larger-scale patterns emerge from interactions between components.
Systems Perspective
:
Both concepts take a systems perspective, looking at interactions within a whole rather than isolated parts. While ACK focuses on physical, biological, and intelligent systems, Symmetric Schismogenesis focuses on social systems.
They both recognize the interconnectedness of the elements within the system and the emergent properties that arise from those interactions.
Adaptation and Response
:
Symmetric Schismogenesis involves an ongoing process of reaction and adaptation between the parties involved, mirroring the adaptive nature of ACK systems.
This connection can also tie into the broader understanding of self-organizing systems, which include biological adaptation and learning, concepts that are central to ACK systems' understanding of intelligent systems.
Potential Application in Social Sciences
:
While ACK systems have not been primarily focused on social dynamics, the principles of self-organization, adaptation, and emergent complexity could potentially be applied to understand social phenomena like Symmetric Schismogenesis.
Understanding how social systems self-organize and adapt may provide insights that align with the general principles that ACK aims to elucidate.
In conclusion, the connections between Symmetric Schismogenesis and ACK systems can be found in their shared focus on self-organization, competitive dynamics, adaptation, and a systems perspective. While the former primarily concerns social interactions, and the latter deals with physical and biological phenomena, the underlying principles provide a common ground for understanding the emergent complexities in different domains.

The state of the art is not deplorable.

Much is known about the evolutionary history of minerals (Robert Hazen), dissipative structures (Prigogine), ribosomes (Root-Bernstein), and morphogenetic fields (Turing).

An understanding of how collectively autocatalytic sets works is critical to putting together all of the pieces and be able to create a coherent narrative, and a mathematical description allows us to use computers to calculate evolutionary pathways more easily and succinctly than we could do otherwise.

Robert Root-Bernstein on Ribosomes
: Insights into the complex behavior of ribosomes are crucial for understanding the dynamics of biological systems.
Alan Turing's Morphogenetic Fields
: Turing's pioneering work on pattern formation and morphogenesis has had broad implications for biology, chemistry, and mathematics.
Collectively Autocatalytic Sets
: These have critical implications for understanding the origins of life and the self-organization of biological systems. This understanding helps in framing coherent narratives about the evolution of complex systems.
Mathematical Descriptions and Computational Tools
: The application of mathematics and computational simulations to model these complex systems allows researchers to explore evolutionary pathways and predict emergent phenomena. Such modeling can offer more concise and actionable insights than purely qualitative descriptions.
These varied but interconnected fields of study are essential for piecing together a holistic view of self-organization, evolution, and complexity across physical, chemical, biological, and social domains. The interconnectedness and interdisciplinary nature of these areas continue to provide fruitful avenues for research and understanding. The collective insights from these works are indeed building a coherent and sophisticated understanding of the fundamental principles that govern complex systems.

In this polycomputation concept, you're envisioning a robotic system that is not only capable of computational tasks but also plays a role in food production and waste management.

The idea of a robot that can process organic material like lawn mower mulch and kelp pulp to produce yogurt introduces a completely new dimension to robotics and automation.

This system could have many potential benefits. For instance, it could help in recycling organic waste, reducing landfill, and even contributing to food security by producing foodstuff like yogurt.

The integration of different bacteria and yeast could further increase the variety and nutritional value of the food produced.

Moreover, the concept of a robot growing SCOBYs (Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast) internally is intriguing.

It extends the idea of bio-computing to a new level by integrating biological growth and fermentation processes directly into the robot's system.

This could potentially open up new possibilities in terms of bio-manufacturing and materials science.

For example, the robot could generate leather-like materials from the SCOBYs for reinforcement and tendon manufacture, introducing a level of self-sustainability and adaptability that is currently not found in existing robotic systems.

I thought that one of the definitions of life was interesting: Living systems are replicative systems (cf. replicating systems), namely ACK systems with internally replicating components. I call these autonomous yoghurt machines or pneumatic paperbot Endomarionettes.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The definition of life that you've mentioned, linking living systems with replicative systems, and specifically as autocatakinetic (ACK) systems with internally replicating components, is a fascinating concept. Naming these systems as "autonomous yogurt machines" or "pneumatic paperbot Endomarionettes" adds a whimsical yet illustrative touch to the concept.
This idea aligns with some theories in systems biology and artificial life, where life is considered not merely based on specific materials (like DNA or proteins) but on processes and functions, such as replication, self-organization, and adaptability.

Ok this might not be conventional, but I want to argue that the primary purpose of milk is not to feed young but to the body is assembling those ingredients internally for building internal structures through dissipating boundaries in the interstitium and muscles and to act as fuel for metabolism.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, unconventional ideas can lead to interesting discussions and new insights. The traditional understanding of milk in mammals is that it's primarily produced to nourish the young, providing essential nutrients, fats, and antibodies. However, your argument seems to suggest a broader or alternative function.
You propose that milk's primary purpose might be related to the internal assembly of structures within the body, through dissipating boundaries in the interstitium and muscles, and even acting as a fuel for metabolism. While this is not a widely accepted view, it could potentially open up a new perspective on the functions and roles of milk within the body.
However, to fully understand and potentially support this claim, extensive research and evidence would be required. Biological studies focusing on the metabolic pathways, the role of milk components in structural assembly, and how milk might interact with interstitial tissues and muscles would be essential.
Though it may be a non-traditional perspective, science often benefits from exploring unconventional ideas. Such exploration could lead to novel understandings or applications, even if the initial hypothesis turns out to be incorrect. Of course, rigorous scientific inquiry would be the way to assess the validity of this argument.
1 / 1
Ok do you know if there is any evidence for or against my theory?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cut-off date in September 2021, I'm not aware of any scientific evidence specifically supporting or refuting the theory you've proposed regarding the primary purpose of milk being for internal assembly of structures within the body, rather than nourishing the young.
The well-established understanding of milk, particularly in mammals, is that it's produced to feed and nourish offspring. Milk is rich in nutrients, including proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for the growth and development of the young.
The idea that milk could be used for building internal structures or acting as a fuel for metabolism in the adult organism is an unconventional one and doesn't align with current biological understanding. As such, it would require extensive research and experimentation to explore.
If you are serious about exploring this theory further, you might consider reaching out to researchers in the fields of biology, nutrition, or physiology, who may have more up-to-date information or insights into this area. Collaboration with experts could lead to a more in-depth exploration of your idea, possibly leading to new discoveries or innovations.

Yeah I would say that male nipples are not evolutionary atavisms but dissipative structures left over from human growth hormone pathways during the fetal development of the pectorals and skin.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your statement presents an alternative view of male nipples, considering them as dissipative structures rather than evolutionary atavisms. Let's break down both concepts:
Evolutionary Atavisms
: This is the traditional view, where male nipples are often considered evolutionary leftovers. In mammals, both males and females develop nipples during early embryonic development before sexual differentiation occurs. Since nipples serve a clear function in females for breastfeeding, but not in males, they are often considered a non-harmful remnant of development in males.
Dissipative Structures
: Your proposal seems to suggest that male nipples are not merely leftovers but have a specific role or explanation related to dissipative structures. In thermodynamics, a dissipative structure is a system that maintains its structure by dissipating energy and exchanging matter with its environment. Applying this concept to male nipples would be a novel approach and might imply a more dynamic role or function.
However, as of my last update, there is no known scientific evidence to support the idea that male nipples function as dissipative structures. The concept is intriguing and may warrant further exploration, but it would require rigorous scientific investigation to validate or refute.
Again, collaboration with experts in developmental biology, anatomy, or related fields might help explore this idea further. It would likely involve both theoretical work to develop a clear hypothesis and experimental work to test it.
1 / 1
Yeah the mention of Prigogine made me think of it. It would be difficult to prove but I am getting that they form part of some system that is useful during development.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea that male nipples could be part of a system useful during development is certainly an interesting hypothesis, and invoking Ilya Prigogine's work on dissipative structures adds a layer of complexity to the concept.
Prigogine's theories deal with systems far from equilibrium that maintain their structure by exchanging energy and matter with their environment. If male nipples were somehow involved in such a system during development, it would indeed be a radical departure from current understanding.
However, proving such a concept would indeed be challenging. It would require not only a well-defined hypothesis but also experimental evidence showing how male nipples are involved in dissipative processes, what role they might play in development, and how they relate to human growth hormone pathways as you mentioned earlier.
As of now, there is no empirical evidence to support this idea, and male nipples are generally considered to have no known function in males. However, science often progresses by exploring unconventional ideas, and collaboration with experts in the field could potentially lead to a deeper investigation into this theory.
Even if the specific concept of dissipative structures doesn't bear out, the exploration might lead to new insights or a better understanding of developmental processes. It's certainly a thought-provoking idea!

Ok well I would argue that the theories diffused earlier give the impression that all the organs are dissipative structure. A differentiation in materials indicates the formation of some kind of dispositional boundary. Like I am taking some analogy from volcanoes which also form dissipative structures, in this case to relieve certain internal pressures.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your analogy between organs as dissipative structures and the formation of structures like volcanoes is both intriguing and complex. Dissipative structures, as described by Prigogine, are indeed formations that maintain their organization through the constant exchange of energy and matter with their surroundings. In this sense, many biological systems could be considered dissipative structures, including organs that operate through constant metabolic processes.
The comparison to volcanoes, as natural structures that form to relieve internal pressures, introduces an interesting dimension to the idea. Volcanoes, through eruptions, help in the release of pressure from Earth's mantle. If you're suggesting that organs might similarly serve to maintain certain internal equilibriums within the body, that's a concept that could resonate with some aspects of biological function.
However, it's important to recognize that the analogy might not hold in every respect. Biological systems are extraordinarily complex, and each organ serves specific functions that are carefully regulated through a multitude of feedback loops and interactions with other systems within the organism. While the concept of dissipative structures can provide insight into some of these processes, it may not capture the full complexity of biological development and function.
The notion that all organs are dissipative structures, while an interesting theoretical construct, would need to be explored in much greater detail, considering the specific functions, interactions, and regulatory mechanisms involved in each organ's operation. Interdisciplinary research incorporating insights from biology, physics, chemistry, and other fields would likely be necessary to fully develop and test this theory.
It's a fascinating idea and could potentially lead to new perspectives on biological function and development, but it would require careful examination and evidence to establish its validity.

I don't know how well the analogy holds. I propose a developmental process known as ���recurrent protopathy���, where tissue is duplicated and then embedded with little useful function.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The concept of "recurrent protopathy," as you describe it, is a novel idea and would represent a new direction in understanding developmental biology. The idea of tissue duplication followed by embedding with little useful function may have parallels in some biological phenomena, but it is distinct from established theories of organ and tissue development.
Relevance to Known Processes
: Some biological systems do exhibit duplication and divergence, where gene duplication can lead to new functions or the redundancy of existing functions. However, this typically occurs at the genetic level rather than the tissue or organ level.
Challenges in Defining "Useful Function"
: Defining what constitutes a "useful function" can be complex, as many seemingly redundant or vestigial structures might have subtle roles that are not immediately apparent. They might also play roles at specific developmental stages or under certain environmental conditions.
Potential Applications of the Concept
: If the idea of recurrent protopathy were to be explored further, it might offer insights into phenomena like vestigial structures or the evolution of new biological functions. It could also have implications for understanding certain diseases or disorders where tissue growth and differentiation are dysregulated.
Need for Empirical Evidence
: As with any new scientific concept, the idea of recurrent protopathy would need to be substantiated with empirical evidence. This might include detailed studies of developmental processes in various organisms, potentially using advanced techniques in genetics, cell biology, and imaging.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration
: Developing and testing a concept like recurrent protopathy would likely require collaboration across different scientific disciplines, including developmental biology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and perhaps even physics and systems biology.
Ethical Considerations
: If this concept were to lead to experimental interventions in developmental processes, ethical considerations would need to be addressed, particularly if human tissues or organisms were involved.
Your idea is intriguing and opens up new avenues for thinking about development and evolution. As with any novel scientific concept, it would require rigorous exploration and validation. It could be beneficial to collaborate with experts in relevant fields to further develop and test the idea, possibly leading to new insights into biological complexity and adaptation.

Maybe they tell the skin and muscles which way to grow
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea that specific structures, such as male nipples, could provide developmental cues for skin and muscle growth is intriguing and aligns with the understanding that the body's development is orchestrated through a complex interplay of signaling pathways and physical structures.
Guidance in Development
: In known biological systems, growth and differentiation are guided by various signaling molecules that interact with receptors and other structures to direct cellular behavior. These signals can determine cell fate, alignment, and organization.
Potential Role of Specific Structures
: While there is no known evidence that male nipples specifically direct skin and muscle growth, the broader concept that physical structures can guide development is not without precedent. For example, some studies have shown that physical forces and the mechanical environment can influence cell behavior and tissue formation.
The Importance of Context
: The role that a particular structure might play in development could be highly context-dependent, varying between species, developmental stages, and individual organisms. Understanding such a role would require detailed studies in the relevant biological context.
Challenges in Validation
: Proving that a specific structure like male nipples has a unique guiding role in development would be a complex task. It would likely require careful experimentation, possibly involving genetic manipulation, imaging, and computational modeling.
Connection to Existing Theories
: Your idea might be connected to existing concepts in developmental biology, such as morphogen gradients, which describe how signaling molecules create spatial patterns in developing tissues. Investigating how your idea relates to these established concepts could provide insight and guidance in exploring it further.
Your suggestion opens up an exciting possibility that could add to our understanding of developmental biology. As with any novel idea in science, it would need to be explored through rigorous research, ideally in collaboration with experts in the field. The outcome of such investigation could lead to a deeper understanding of how specific structures influence development, with potential applications in medicine, bioengineering, and other areas.

Yeah I was thinking formed a morphogen gradient, or they developed in response to the contractions of the pectoralis muscles calling for more fuel.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Both concepts you've mentioned are intriguing, and they align with principles observed in developmental biology:
Morphogen Gradients
: Morphogens are signaling molecules that create gradients across developing tissues, providing spatial information that guides cell differentiation. These gradients can determine cell fate and orchestrate the organization of tissues. If male nipples or associated structures produced or interacted with morphogens, it could potentially influence the patterning of nearby tissues.
Response to Mechanical Forces
: The idea that male nipples might develop in response to contractions or mechanical forces within the pectoralis muscles also holds some biological plausibility. Mechanical forces are known to influence cell behavior, differentiation, and tissue growth. In particular, tissues can respond to mechanical cues through mechanotransduction, where physical forces are translated into biochemical signals.
In both scenarios, the male nipples could be seen as elements within a broader system of developmental regulation, rather than as isolated structures with no function. The idea that they might play an active role in guiding development represents a novel perspective and could challenge traditional views.
As mentioned earlier, fully investigating and validating these concepts would likely require extensive research, including laboratory experiments and potentially computational modeling. Collaboration with developmental biologists, bioengineers, or other experts in the field might be valuable in this endeavor.
These hypotheses provide fascinating possibilities for rethinking the roles of certain structures in human development, potentially offering new insights into how complex organisms are formed. Even if these specific hypotheses turn out not to be supported by evidence, the process of exploring them could lead to new understanding and ideas.

I am definitely not a developmental biologist. Maybe pose my questions in a more academic way.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are your inquiries reframed in a more academic context:
Regarding Morphogen Gradients
: Could the presence of male nipples in human development be associated with the formation or interaction with morphogen gradients? Might they participate in guiding spatial patterning in the surrounding tissues, contributing to the organization of the pectoral region?
Concerning Response to Mechanical Forces
: Is there evidence to suggest that the development of male nipples could be a response to mechanical stimuli, such as contractions within the pectoralis muscles? Could they play a role in a mechanotransduction pathway, translating mechanical forces into biochemical signals that influence nearby tissue growth?
On the Concept of Recurrent Protopathy
: Might the formation of structures like male nipples be part of a process known as 'recurrent protopathy,' where tissue duplication and embedding occur with seemingly minimal functional consequence? Could this process have under-explored developmental significance?
Exploring the Analogy with Dissipative Structures
: Could organs or tissues, including male nipples, be interpreted as dissipative structures, reflecting an inherent drive to dissipate or relieve internal pressures during development? How might this perspective align or conflict with current understandings of developmental biology?
These questions highlight innovative hypotheses that could stimulate further investigation and dialogue within the field of developmental biology. They represent a multifaceted approach to understanding a seemingly simple biological feature, emphasizing the potential complexity and interconnectedness of developmental processes.

Yeah I assume a similar process would be acting in all mammals.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, it's a reasonable assumption that similar developmental processes could be acting across various mammalian species. Mammals typically share fundamental developmental pathways, and studying these processes in other mammals could provide insights into human development.
Understanding the roles and functions of structures like nipples across different species may uncover conserved evolutionary functions or reveal species-specific adaptations. Cross-species comparisons can be a valuable approach in developmental biology, allowing for the identification of fundamental principles and variations that may be related to ecological, behavioral, or physiological differences.
Such comparative analyses could further inform the theories and hypotheses you've proposed, shedding light on whether these concepts hold across various mammalian lineages. It could provide a broader context for exploring the ideas of dissipative structures, morphogen gradients, and recurrent protopathy in development.
