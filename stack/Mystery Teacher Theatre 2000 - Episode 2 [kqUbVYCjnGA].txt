Okay, so you think we ought to try this again?
Well, again, best feature in America according to Bill Gates.
Maybe they've got lots, thousands, I think, of content up there.
Maybe we just picked a bad example.
And this is from the same guy?
This is from the same guy, but this is more high school content.
So maybe he's got a better repertoire with the high school stuff.
So this is introductions to matrices.
It's also a little bit longer, so maybe he'll get to some of the wise and stuff.
About this one?
Yeah, because this is 12 minutes.
Con.
Really? Every time?
Okay, yeah, maybe.
Let's learn about matrices.
Let's!
See, I think the interesting thing is something that I've learned in my classroom.
It's probably a word.
Hollywood.
Mathematics.
Matrix.
So what is a matrix?
Well, it's actually a pre-soldered matrix.
Good.
Do you have any on you?
No, I don't have any on me.
I don't like that.
To get into a kind of category, do you have to stay in the matrix or leave the matrix?
At least this one has color.
Oh, my God.
And the other one was all white, wasn't it?
Yeah.
I wonder when he decides to use a different color.
Minus five.
That is a matrix.
And all it is is a table of numbers.
And oftentimes, you know, if you wanted to have a variable for a matrix,
you could use a capital letter.
So you could use a capital A.
And sometimes in some books, they make the extra bolds of the old A.
That's what I'm going to take it from.
Whoa!
The bolding is scribbled over.
Extra bold.
Two by three matrix.
Two by three.
All of the bold letters in this matrix.
And one is two and one is three.
Uh-oh.
Well, two is another word.
Just for watching?
Anyone know stinking badges?
Oh, there's your badge.
Badges?
We don't need no stinking badges!
Oh no!
One, two, three.
So that's why it's called a two by two name.
So when you say, you know, three columns, okay?
I said a, I said the B
of the extra volt.
Extra volt.
That means a five by two name.
That means that B
would have,
I could put it to one.
I was typing number zero.
That looks a lot like it's writing those numbers.
That's two.
So that's five for the two columns.
So not another column.
It's minus ten, three.
I'm just putting random numbers here.
Seven.
And a random number generator at the same time.
Pie.
That's why I'm going on.
Yeah, you're random.
I'm pretty sure it's literally zero.
It's a table of numbers.
You can represent it.
But it's nice to show when we're going on with these acts of evil.
The whole space is capital letters.
Sometimes we write a two by three there.
And you can actually reference...
Have you ever written underneath it?
Like what size is this?
A.
If someone wanted to reference...
And I certainly haven't said it three or four times in the lesson.
Maybe again, that's my problem.
Second row.
It's a row of two.
And it's a column of two, right?
It's a column of one.
It's a second row of two.
Sometimes people will write that...
A...
They'll write...
Two column of two.
So that's not an agent.
It's equal to zero.
Or they might write...
Sometimes they'll write a lowercase.
A two column of two.
And it's equal to zero.
Okay.
But what is a...
These are just the same thing.
I'm just doing this to expose you to the notation.
There's a lot of this really asian notation.
There's a lot of these in terms of...
One.
Three.
Well, that would be for the first row.
Two.
Or two.
That's not right.
So this is just ultimately...
The fact that there is no further row of two columns.
Absolutely nothing.
Matrix is just...
War.
That's all it is.
It's equal to zero.
But it can be used to represent the whole seventh column.
If you're doing this...
And you're out for longer, you're out for two class.
You're probably using it to represent many of your equations.
But we'll learn later that...
And I'll...
I'll tell you later.
It can represent...
It's very powerful in...
If you're doing computer graphics.
The matrix...
The elements can represent pixels on your screen.
They can represent points in coordinate space.
They can represent...
Who knows? There's tons of things that they can represent.
But the important thing around this...
The matrix...
He could think of what?
It's not like a...
It's not like a lot of the mathematical concepts...
It's a way to represent...
The mathematical concept.
What did you say?
I have to hear that again.
Again, John, you're right.
This is the power of...
It's not like a lot of the mathematical concepts...
It's a way to represent...
The mathematical concept.
The mathematical concept.
It's a natural phenomenon.
Not like a lot of mathematics.
Because it's a way to represent...
Mathematics.
What it actually represents.
Oh, he's going to tell us?
Thanks.
Wait, what does that mean again?
The matrix is actually representing.
And let's learn the convention.
But let's put that on the backboard.
In terms of...
Mathematics.
Mathematics.
Mathematics.
Why are you here?
I have to say...
As a teacher that's never happened to me.
We do get interrupted.
Yeah, so it's not on my wife.
It's how I do predict my experience.
How do you multiply?
How do you multiply an editor?
I have to determine it.
I had it all.
I must find it.
You're going to do the determinants of these matrices. That should be all these.
It's really human to find the better ones later on.
The intuition part of what they are.
Oh, if I can only walk out.
So let's say I wanted to add these two matrices.
Oh, I don't think we're going to have enough time to finish this.
Let's say I'll do relatively small ones.
I'll compare these two.
I try to think up my examples in advance.
Maybe that's your problem.
Let's say matrix B is equal to minus 7, 2, 3, 5.
So my question to you is, what is A?
It's not going to be bold.
Why didn't you just add those two in the first one?
Someone defined that. They could have defined some other way.
But they said, we're going to make matrices add the way I'm about to show you
because it's useful for a whole set of matrices.
We'll talk about that later.
But in most other matrices, the element doesn't make it.
It's not connected though.
So it's 3 plus minus 7.
That'll be the 1, 1, element.
The row and column 2 element will be minus 1 plus 2.
Minus 1 plus 2.
That's what we're going to see about this.
I think you can guess how this keeps going.
This element will be 2.
But you're going to make us sit through it in any way.
This element, this last one, will be 0 plus 5.
0 plus 5.
Isn't that better than that?
Even money class because why?
I'll try to think about whether it's better than a power point.
Why is 1 plus 2?
At least because it's filled with all of what he's done.
And 0 plus 5 is 5.
So there we have it.
That is how we humans have defined the addition of 2.
But the alien?
The alien.
The alien mathematics.
You might have been right about color.
This is something we have to think about.
We're not adding numbers in here.
He was just talking about time.
I need 2 normal numbers.
It doesn't matter the order you're at.
It's not completely obvious.
When you define it in this way,
it doesn't matter if we do a plus b or b plus a.
If b plus a is what you're saying,
negative 7 plus 3 is what you're saying,
2 plus 3.
That is matrix addition.
And you're going to manage all of these attractions.
I don't think he's lit that up.
I'm going to wake up and think again.
Transitivity.
A minus b.
A minus b.
What's a bold minus?
Because that's a big curts up rule.
Did he really die?
Oh.
I think it's a spidery.
Plus.
Is that the minus alpha?
What's b?
What's b?
2, 3, 5.
So he's defining subtraction.
You just multiply the number times
every one of the times.
So that equals a matrix A
plus the matrix.
You just multiply it.
If he hadn't bolded all of those,
this would be like a 5 minute minus 2
minus 3.
5.
And then if you do that,
should be negative 2.
He doesn't have an editor.
But he couldn't take another 11,
12 minutes to fix it.
Negative 1 is negative 2
minus 3
2 plus minus 3 is minus 1.
So wait for it.
Plus 5 is 5.
And you didn't have to bold it.
Oh.
I like that.
I made mistakes too.
Right.
Multiply a scalar.
But I talked with video of that on YouTube.
Yeah.
As the best teacher in the United States.
I think that's going to make us bitter
if we just keep thinking like this.
By this definition of matrix addition,
well we know that both matrices
have to be the same size.
By this definition, wait for it to happen.
So for example,
you could add these two matrices.
You could add, I don't know, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7.
Not so random.
I don't think.
2, minus 10.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
