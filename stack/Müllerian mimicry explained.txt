M��llerian mimicry explained
Sumarize: M��llerian mimicry is a natural phenomenon in which two or more well-defended species, often foul-tasting and sharing common predators, have come to mimic each other's honest warning signals, to their mutual benefit. The benefit to M��llerian mimics is that predators only need one unpleasant encounter with one member of a set of M��llerian mimics, and thereafter avoid all similar coloration, whether or not it belongs to the same species as the initial encounter. It is named after the German naturalist Fritz M��ller, who first proposed the concept in 1878, supporting his theory with the first mathematical model of frequency-dependent selection, one of the first such models anywhere in biology.[a][2][3]

M��llerian mimicry is a natural phenomenon where multiple species that are unpalatable or dangerous to predators mimic each other's warning signals, leading to mutual benefits. The advantage lies in the fact that once a predator has a negative encounter with a member of this mimicry group, it learns to avoid all organisms displaying similar patterns or colors, regardless of their actual species. This concept was proposed by German naturalist Fritz M��ller in 1878, who backed up his theory with one of the first-ever mathematical models of frequency-dependent selection in biology.

M��llerian mimicry was first identified in tropical butterflies that shared colourful wing patterns, but it is found in many groups of insects such as bumblebees, and other animals including poison frogs and coral snakes. The mimicry need not be visual; for example, many snakes share auditory warning signals. Similarly, the defences involved are not limited to toxicity; anything that tends to deter predators, such as foul taste, sharp spines, or defensive behaviour can make a species unprofitable enough to predators to allow M��llerian mimicry to develop.

Once a pair of M��llerian mimics has formed, other mimics may join them by advergent evolution (one species changing to conform to the appearance of the pair, rather than mutual convergence), forming mimicry rings. Large rings are found for example in velvet ants. Since the frequency of mimics is positively correlated with survivability, rarer mimics are likely to adapt to resemble commoner models, favouring both advergence and larger M��llerian mimicry rings. Where mimics are not strongly protected by venom or other defences, honest M��llerian mimicry becomes, by degrees, the better-known bluffing of Batesian mimicry.

M��llerian mimicry was initially recognized in tropical butterflies with similar colorful wing patterns, but it is observed in various insects like bumblebees, as well as other creatures, including poison frogs and coral snakes. This mimicry doesn't have to be visual; many snakes, for example, share auditory warning signals. Furthermore, the defenses involved can include more than just toxicity. Anything that deters predators, such as foul taste, sharp spines, or defensive behavior, can make a species unappealing to predators, allowing for the development of M��llerian mimicry.
When two M��llerian mimics are established, other species can join them through advergent evolution, where one species adapts to match the existing pair's appearance, leading to the formation of mimicry rings. Large rings are found, for instance, in velvet ants. As the survival rate correlates positively with the frequency of mimics, less common mimics tend to adapt to resemble the more common models, encouraging both advergence and larger M��llerian mimicry rings. In instances where mimics lack potent defenses like venom, honest M��llerian mimicry can gradually shift to Batesian mimicry, a better-known form of deceptive mimicry.

Deception in animals is the transmission of misinformation by one animal to another, of the same or different species, in a way that propagates beliefs that are not true.

Mimicry and camouflage enable animals to appear to be other than they are. Prey animals may appear as predators, or vice versa; both predators and prey may be hard to see (crypsis), or may be mistaken for other objects (mimesis). In Batesian mimicry, harmless animals may appear to be distasteful or poisonous. In automimicry, animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.

In more active forms of anti-predator adaptation, animals may feign death when they detect a predator, or may quickly conceal themselves or take action to distract a predator, such as when a cephalopod releases ink. In deimatic behaviour, a harmless animal adopts a threatening pose or displays startling, brightly coloured parts of its body to startle a predator or rival.

Some animals may use tactical deception, with behaviour that is deployed in a way that other animals misinterpret what is happening to the advantage of the agent. Some of the evidence for this is anecdotal, but in the great apes in particular, experimental studies[which?] in ethology suggest that deception is actively practised by some animals.

Deception in animals refers to the communication of false information from one animal to another, regardless of whether they belong to the same or different species, fostering false beliefs.
Mimicry and camouflage are two mechanisms through which animals deceive others. These strategies enable prey to appear as predators, and vice versa. They can also render both predators and prey hard to spot (crypsis) or lead them to be mistaken for other objects (mimesis). In Batesian mimicry, harmless creatures imitate the appearances of harmful or distasteful ones. Automimicry, on the other hand, is where animals possess features like eyespots on less vital parts of their bodies, aiming to divert an attack and improve their chances of survival.
Animals employ more proactive forms of anti-predator adaptation as well. For instance, they may feign death upon detecting a predator or swiftly hide or create distractions, such as a cephalopod releasing ink. In deimatic behavior, a harmless creature assumes a threatening posture or showcases bright body parts to surprise and repel a predator or rival.
Tactical deception is another strategy animals might use, wherein behavior is manipulated in such a way that other animals misconstrue the situation, ultimately benefiting the deceiver. Although some evidence of this is anecdotal, experimental studies in ethology, especially among great apes, suggest that some animals actively engage in deceptive behavior.

Batesian mimicry is the most commonly known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with M��llerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.

Batesian mimicry is the most familiar and extensively studied type of mimicry complex, to the point where the term "mimicry" is often equated with Batesian mimicry. This form involves harmless species imitating the appearance of harmful or distasteful ones to avoid predation. However, many other forms of mimicry exist, varying in similarity to Batesian mimicry.
Batesian mimicry is frequently compared with M��llerian mimicry, another form where harmful species mutually benefit by imitating each other's warning signals. This distinction, however, is not absolute as the mimic in Batesian mimicry may also have some level of protection.
Batesian mimicry can also be contrasted with other functionally different types of mimicry. Aggressive mimicry offers a striking contrast where a predator or parasite imitates a harmless species to evade detection and enhance its hunting success. Therefore, while Batesian mimicry is a defensive strategy for prey, aggressive mimicry is an offensive strategy for predators or parasites.

Pseudocopulation describes behaviors similar to copulation that serve a reproductive function for one or both participants but do not involve actual sexual union between the individuals. It is most generally applied to a pollinator attempting to copulate with a flower. Some flowers mimic a potential female mate visually, but the key stimuli are often chemical and tactile.[1] This form of mimicry in plants is called Pouyannian mimicry.[2]


Ophrys speculum, the mirror bee orchid (more photos)
Orchids commonly achieve reproduction in this manner, secreting chemicals from glands (osmophores) in the sepals, petals, or labellum, that are indistinguishable from the insect's natural pheromones. The pollinator then has a pollinium attached to its body, which it transfers to the stigma of another flower when it attempts another 'copulation'. Pollinators are often bees, and wasps of the order Hymenoptera, and flies.

The cost to the pollinating insects might be seen as negligible, but study of Cryptostylis (an Australian orchid) pollinators shows that they may waste large amounts of sperm by ejaculating onto the flower. Thus there could be antagonistic coevolution such that pollinators become better at identifying their own species correctly and orchids become better mimics.

Pseudocopulation refers to behaviors that resemble copulation and serve a reproductive function for one or both participants, but do not involve actual sexual union. This term is commonly used to describe a pollinator's attempt to mate with a flower, a behavior primarily stimulated by chemical and tactile cues rather than visual ones. This form of mimicry in plants is known as Pouyannian mimicry.
Orchids frequently reproduce this way, secreting chemicals from glands (osmophores) located in their sepals, petals, or labellum, which perfectly mimic the natural pheromones of the pollinators. Pollinators like bees, wasps, and flies then have a mass of pollen (pollinium) attached to their bodies, which they subsequently transfer to another flower during their next pseudocopulation attempt.
While the costs to the pollinating insects may seem minimal, studies of certain Australian orchids (Cryptostylis) show that pollinators can waste significant amounts of sperm by ejaculating onto the flower. This could potentially lead to antagonistic coevolution, with pollinators improving at correctly identifying their own species, and orchids becoming increasingly sophisticated mimics.

Sure, here's a summary of the main topics we've discussed:
M��llerian mimicry
: A phenomenon where two or more harmful or distasteful species mimic each other's warning signals for mutual benefit. This concept was proposed by Fritz M��ller in 1878. M��llerian mimicry can involve various types of deterrents to predators, including visual, auditory, or taste cues, and it's not limited to species with toxic defenses.
Mimicry rings
: These are groups of species that have come to mimic each other's warning signals through advergent evolution. The frequency of mimics correlates positively with their survivability, leading to the creation of larger mimicry rings.
Transition from M��llerian to Batesian mimicry
: This occurs when mimics lack strong protective defenses. Batesian mimicry is a form of deceptive mimicry, where harmless creatures imitate the appearances of harmful or distasteful ones.
Deception in animals
: This involves transmitting misinformation that fosters false beliefs in other animals. Deception strategies can include mimicry, camouflage, feigning death, and tactical deception.
Batesian mimicry
: This is the most widely known and studied form of mimicry, often equated with the term mimicry itself. It's contrasted with M��llerian mimicry and aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species.
Pseudocopulation
: This is a behavior that resembles copulation but does not involve actual sexual union. It serves a reproductive function and is commonly seen when a pollinator attempts to mate with a flower. This form of mimicry, known as Pouyannian mimicry, often leads to successful pollination in plants, particularly orchids.
Antagonistic coevolution
: In the context of pseudocopulation, this refers to the evolutionary arms race between pollinators and flowers, where pollinators improve at correctly identifying their own species and flowers become better mimics.

Here's a brief summary of each type of plant mimicry you've mentioned:
Bakerian Mimicry
: In this type of mimicry, female flowers imitate male flowers of the same species, attracting pollinators under the pretense of offering pollen.
M��llerian Mimicry
: In the context of plants, this occurs when a plant mimics a rewarding flower or fruit. The mimic and the model are both beneficial to the pollinator, reducing the likelihood of the mimic being identified and avoided.
Dodsonian Mimicry
: This is a subset of M��llerian mimicry where a plant lures pollinators by mimicking another species of rewarding flower. This can also include fruit mimicry, where a plant's fruit imitates that of another species to attract animals, which then help distribute its seeds.
Vavilovian Mimicry
: This occurs when a weed evolves to resemble a crop plant, and is unintentionally artificially selected due to its similarity to the desired crop. This makes the weed more difficult to identify and remove.
Pouyannian Mimicry
: Here, a flower imitates a female mate for a pollinating insect, inducing the insect to attempt to mate with the flower (pseudocopulation) and thereby facilitating pollination.
Batesian Mimicry
: This type of mimicry happens when a harmless plant deters predators by mimicking the characteristics of a harmful or distasteful plant.
Leaf Mimicry
: This occurs when a plant resembles a nearby plant to evade the attention of herbivores. By blending in with the surrounding vegetation, the plant is less likely to be noticed and eaten.
Each of these forms of mimicry is a unique survival strategy, demonstrating the diverse ways that plants have evolved to interact with their environment and other organisms.

Sure, here are analogies for each type of plant mimicry you mentioned:
Bakerian Mimicry
: Imagine a masquerade ball where a woman dresses as a man to get the attention of other men. Similarly, female flowers in Bakerian mimicry "dress up" as male flowers to attract pollinators.
M��llerian Mimicry
: Think of two successful brands with similar products, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. They both offer a similar reward (a sweet, carbonated drink), and customers have little preference between them. This is like M��llerian mimicry where two or more rewarding plant species resemble each other, and pollinators aren't bothered by the difference.
Dodsonian Mimicry
: It's like a store offering free samples to attract customers, giving the illusion that their products are high-quality and worth purchasing. Similarly, Dodsonian mimicry occurs when a plant lures pollinators by mimicking another rewarding plant species.
Vavilovian Mimicry
: Imagine a spy blending into a crowd by wearing a uniform like everyone else to avoid detection. In the same way, weeds in Vavilovian mimicry blend in with crop plants, making them harder to be identified and removed.
Pouyannian Mimicry
: This is like a person using perfume or cologne that mimics human pheromones to attract potential mates. Similarly, in Pouyannian mimicry, flowers imitate the pheromones of female insects to lure male insects for pollination.
Batesian Mimicry
: It's like a person wearing a police uniform to deter potential threats, even though they're not a police officer. Batesian mimicry works the same way, where a harmless plant deters predators by mimicking the characteristics of a harmful or distasteful plant.
Leaf Mimicry
: This is akin to a chameleon blending into the foliage to evade predators. In leaf mimicry, a plant blends in with its surrounding vegetation to avoid the attention of herbivores.

Epitope binning is a competitive immunoassay used to characterize and then sort a library of monoclonal antibodies against a target protein.[1] Antibodies against a similar target are tested against all other antibodies in the library in a pairwise fashion to see if antibodies block one another's binding to the epitope of an antigen.[2] After each antibody has a profile created against all of the other antibodies in the library, a competitive blocking profile is created for each antibody relative to the others in the library. Closely related binning profiles indicate that the antibodies have the same or a closely related epitope and are "binned" together.[2] Epitope binning is referenced in the literature under different names such as epitope mapping and epitope characterization.[2] Regardless of the naming, epitope binning is prevalent in the pharmaceutical industry.[2] Epitope Binning is used in the discovery and development of new therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics.[3]

Epitope binning is essentially a process of categorizing or "binning" antibodies based on their binding sites (epitopes) on a target protein. You can think of it like a massive, highly specific game of musical chairs. Each antibody is like a player, and the epitopes on the target protein are the chairs. By observing which antibodies block each other from binding to the protein, scientists can determine which antibodies are competing for the same "chair" (epitope).
Just like in the game, players (antibodies) that compete for the same chair (epitope) are grouped together. In this way, a comprehensive profile or "map" of antibody binding is created. This is crucial in pharmaceutical research, as it helps researchers understand the range of antibodies that can interact with a specific protein, and could guide the development of new vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic tools.

In immunology, epitope mapping is the process of experimentally identifying the binding site, or epitope, of an antibody on its target antigen (usually, on a protein).[1][2][3] Identification and characterization of antibody binding sites aid in the discovery and development of new therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics.[4][5][6][7][8] Epitope characterization can also help elucidate the binding mechanism of an antibody[9] and can strengthen intellectual property (patent) protection.[10][11][12] Experimental epitope mapping data can be incorporated into robust algorithms to facilitate in silico prediction of B-cell epitopes based on sequence and/or structural data.[13

Epitope mapping, in immunology, is like a detective methodically investigating a crime scene to identify exactly where and how a key event occurred. Here, the "detective" is the scientist, the "crime scene" is the target antigen (usually a protein), and the "key event" is the binding of an antibody to its specific site, or epitope, on the antigen.
Understanding this binding site is crucial - it's like knowing the exact location where a crucial piece of evidence was found. This knowledge can be used to design effective therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools, much like how a detective's findings can help to prevent future crimes or apprehend a criminal.
Moreover, characterizing the binding mechanism of an antibody (understanding how the "event" took place) can lead to stronger patent protection, similar to how detailed knowledge of a unique process can lead to a patent in other fields. Additionally, the data from epitope mapping can be incorporated into algorithms for in silico (computer-based) prediction of B-cell epitopes, kind of like using past crime data to predict future crime locations.

autoantigen [�����t����an���tijin] Etymology: Gk, autos + anti, against, genein, to produce an endogenous body constituent that stimulates the production of autoantibodies and an autoimmune reaction. An autoantigen associated with Addison's disease has been identified as the enzyme 17 ��-hydroxylase. Also called self-antigen. See also antibody-specific model, autoantibody, autoimmune disease.

An autoantigen can be compared to a mistaken identity or a case of friendly fire within the body's defense system. It's an internal component of the body, like a protein, which is mistakenly identified as foreign by the immune system. This triggers the production of autoantibodies, leading to an autoimmune reaction.
Imagine a spy thriller in which an undercover agent is mistaken for an enemy operative by his own organization. Despite being part of the same team, the misidentification leads the agency to target their own member, much like the immune system mistakenly targets an autoantigen in an autoimmune disease. For example, in Addison's disease, the "undercover agent" is the enzyme 17 ��-hydroxylase, which is mistakenly targeted by the body's own defenses.
