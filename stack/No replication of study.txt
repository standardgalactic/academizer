I couldn't find any specific replication studies of the 2012 research led by Carnegie Mellon University that suggested parents are less likely to catch a cold. The original study, which was quite significant in its findings, showed that parents were 52 percent less likely to develop a cold than non-parents when exposed to a cold virus���
���. This lack of replication studies is not uncommon in scientific research, as many studies do not undergo immediate replication due to various factors such as resource availability, research interest, or emerging new research areas.

The study "Parenthood and host resistance to the common cold" by Rodlescia S. Sneed and others has been cited by several subsequent studies, though these do not appear to be direct replications. Instead, they have explored related themes. For instance:
"Common cold" by Eccles R. (2023) is a review article in Front Allergy.
"The Type I interferon antiviral gene program is impaired by lockdown and preserved by caregiving" by Cole SW et al. (2021) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"Resilience during uncertainty? Greater social connectedness during COVID-19 lockdown is associated with reduced distress and fatigue" by Nitschke JP et al. (2021) in the British Journal of Health Psychology.

I found other citations, but none that were a replication. It is interesting that these studies would mention the articles finding as support, when there was only one study.

You raise an important point about the nature of scientific research and citation practices. It's not uncommon for a single study to be cited as supporting evidence in related research, especially when it presents novel or significant findings. However, the strength of scientific evidence is generally bolstered by replication studies, which help to confirm or challenge the original findings. The absence of direct replications doesn't necessarily invalidate the original study's findings, but it does highlight the need for ongoing research to further explore and verify such results. The interconnectedness of various studies, even without direct replication, contributes to the gradual development of a more comprehensive understanding in the field.

Based on their titles, these studies seem to explore the relationship between social hierarchy and stress hormone levels in primates:
"Social correlates of the dominance rank and long-term cortisol levels in adolescent and adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)" by Feng et al. (2016) likely investigates how social status (dominance rank) in male rhesus macaques correlates with their cortisol levels, a key stress-related hormone, across different age groups.
"Are subordinates always stressed? A comparative analysis of rank differences in cortisol levels among primates" by Abbott et al. (2003) seems to examine whether subordinate individuals in various primate species consistently exhibit higher cortisol levels, questioning the assumption that lower social rank always correlates with higher stress.
Both studies appear to contribute to understanding how social dynamics influence physiological stress responses in primates.

Among primate species there is pronounced variation in the relationship between social status and measures of stress physiology. An informal meta-analysis was designed to investigate the basis of this diversity across different primate societies. Species were included only if a substantial amount of published information was available regarding both social behavior and rank-related differences in stress physiology. Four Old World and three New World species met these criteria, including societies varying from small-group, singular cooperative breeders (common marmoset and cotton top tamarin) to large-troop, multi-male, multi-female polygynous mating systems (rhesus, cynomolgus, talapoin, squirrel monkeys, and olive baboon). A questionnaire was formulated to obtain information necessary to characterize the stress milieu for individuals in particular primate societies. We standardized cortisol values within each species by calculating the ratio of basal cortisol concentrations of subordinates to those of dominants in stable dominance hierarchies and expressing the ratio as a percentage (relative cortisol levels). The meta-analysis identified two variables that significantly predicted relative cortisol levels: subordinates exhibited higher relative cortisol levels when they (1). were subjected to higher rates of stressors, and (2). experienced decreased opportunities for social (including close kin) support. These findings have important implications for understanding the different physiological consequences of dominant and subordinate social status across primate societies and how social rank may differ in its behavioral and physiological manifestations among primate societies.

This informal meta-analysis examines the variation in stress physiology related to social status across different primate species. By focusing on species with substantial information on social behavior and stress physiology, the study standardized cortisol levels (a stress marker) to compare subordinates and dominants within each species. The analysis revealed two key predictors for higher relative cortisol levels in subordinates: increased exposure to stressors and reduced opportunities for social support, including from close kin. These findings highlight the complexity of social rank's physiological and behavioral impacts across primate societies, emphasizing how dominant and subordinate roles can have varying consequences.

Introduction
In mammals, including humans, challenges to homeostasis commonly evoke a series of endocrine and neural actions known as the stress response. While not as stereotyped as once thought, the stress response typically involves release of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) from the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla, release of adrenocortical steroid hormones (glucocorticoids), and initiation of a variety of other endocrine responses, including suppression of hormones related to anabolism, growth, and reproduction Orth and Kovacs 1998, Sapolsky et al., 2000, Sapolsky 2002. Collectively, the stress response aids in adapting an individual to an acute stressor by stimulating hepatic glucose release and visceral lipolysis, enhancing delivery (via enhanced cardiovascular tone) of glucose, fatty acids, and triglycerides to skeletal muscle and brain, triaging processes nonessential to immediate survival (such as growth, digestion, reproduction, and tissue repair), and constraining inflammatory and immune responses. Despite these adaptive functions, it has long been recognized that chronic or prolonged activation of the stress response can have deleterious physiological effects, including the induction or worsening of hypertension, insulin-resistant (type II) diabetes, ulceration in the gastrointestinal tract, anovulation, impotence, osteoporosis, psychogenic dwarfism, and immunosuppression (Sapolsky, 2002).

Because of the pathological consequences of a prolonged stress response, much attention has focused on individual differences in patterns of secretion of stress response hormones. These can include differences in blood hormone levels prior to and during the stress response, the speed of physiological recovery of homeostasis after the stress response abates, or the ease with which different types of stressors differentially provoke separate components of the stress response. As examples of such differences, a number of psychiatric disorders and personality types have been associated with what can arguably be termed a maladaptive and overactive stress response. These include major depression (Holsboer, 1999), repressive personality (Brandtstadter et al., 1991), and Type A personality (Williams, 1989). Differential fetal programming (Seckl, 2001) and endocrine disruption of pre- and perinatal environments (Clarke et al., 1994) can result in further exaggeration of adult stress responses.

Another branch of psychoneuroendocrine research has focused on ways in which individual differences in the stress response can reflect differences in dominance status among social animals. In some species, subordinance has been reported to be associated with a chronically overactive stress response (as assessed by hypersecretion of glucocorticoids or catecholamines, higher blood pressure, and greater incidences of stress-related pathologies). This pattern is thought to reflect the classical picture of dominance hierarchies as linear ���pecking orders��� in which resources are unevenly distributed, inequalities are maintained through aggression and intimidation, and subordinates are subject to the most severe resource limitations, the fewest opportunities for coping, and the greatest physical and social stressors (Albeck et al., 1997).

The relationship between social rank and patterns of the stress response is not consistent among primates in that there is no monolithic relationship between social status and any aspect of stress physiology Abbott et al., 1997, Clarke and Boinski 1995, Sapolsky 1993. This diversity appears to reflect, among other things, the extraordinary variety of primate social systems, which often constitute striking exceptions to hierarchical pecking orders Dunbar 1988, Strier 1996, de Waal 1989 and include complex, affiliative relationships that ameliorate responses to stressors, such as through reconciliation de Waal 1993, de Waal 2000, providing different forms of coping mechanisms to individuals (Bercovitch, 1991).

The purpose of the meta-analysis performed in this study is to identify the social variables that predict primate societies in which (1) subordinates have overactive stress responses, (2) subordinates have diminished stress responses, or (3) stress responses do not vary with social rank. More broadly, we are attempting to understand the social roles of individuals, in terms of their rank, sex, and species, and the relationship of such roles in different primate species to differences in the stress response.

In order to identify primate societies that give rise to differing relationships between rank and physiology, it is important to first review factors that stimulate or ameliorate the stress response.

One factor is the frequency at which an individual is exposed to physical stressors. As such, it is important to consider rank-related differences in (1) availability of food and the effort needed to acquire it, (2) exposure to pathogens, (3) likelihood of being threatened by a predator, and (4) the incidence of aggressive challenge and injury.

Of at least equal importance is the rate at which an individual is exposed to psychological stressors. An extensive and elegant literature has demonstrated that psychological variables can stimulate the stress response outright and can dramatically modulate the response to physical stressors Bakshi and Kalin 2000, Levine et al., 1989, Abbott et al., 1997, McEwen 2001, Sapolsky et al., 2000. Broadly, for the same physical insult, individuals are far more likely to have a stress response and a stress-related disease if they lack a sense of control or lack predictive information about the timing, severity, or duration of the stressor. It thus becomes important to understand whether there are rank-related differences in the extent to which individuals (1) can control access to resources, (2) are subject to aggression, and (3) can establish stable and predictable social relations.

Finally, the response to physical or social stressors is considerably blunted by the availability of coping responses, such as social outlets for frustration or social support (Sapolsky, 2002). Thus, rank-related differences in the availability of social contact, social grooming, sexual behavior, and frustration displacement of aggression become as relevant as low rank and the degree of accompanying stressors.

Conclusion 
We have identif i ed two social variables in primate soci- 
eties (Questions 2A and 2B; Table 2) that consistently 
predict whether subordinate or dominant animals exhibit 
elevated basal cortisol levels (hypercortisolism). Our i nd- 
ings have important implications for understanding the dif- 
ferent physiological consequences of low social rank in 
different primate societies: 
(1) ���Rank��� is not uniform in its social meaning across 
different primate species, and some investigators 
have questioned the utility of the rank concept in 
some cases (Rowell, 1966). Insofar as rank is not a 
consistent construct, the physiological correlates of 
rank follow suit. This is likely to extend beyond 
comparisons among primate species, as in the 
present study, to (a) between a variety of nonprimate 
species, and (b) between different populations within 
the same species. 
(2) These studies were carried out on populations of 
primates living in captivity (and thus, well-fed and 
under veterinary care) or in a particularly benign 
ecosystem in the wild (in this case, the Serengeti and 
including only male olive baboons; Table 1). As 
such, the individuals assessed in all study popula- 
tions were probably subject to few or no stressors 
attributable to hunger, illness, or predation, and 
probably had particularly high densities of poten- 
tially stressful social interactions, given their close 
proximities. Thus, much as with many present-day 
human societies, the physiology of stress in our 
study populations of nonhuman primates can mostly 
be understood in the context of social and psycho- 
logical stressors generated between conspecif i cs 
within their social environment. 
(3) The extent to which social stress has physiological or 
pathophysiological consequences is not merely a 
function of the frequency or severity with which an 
individual is exposed to stressors. This represents 
only half the equation. Of equal importance is the 
availability and eff i cacy of coping responses (and 
possibly close kin) to offset the physiological impact 
of social stressors, indicating that subordination 
leads to not one, but a variety of social consequences 
across the different primate societies. Our compara- 
tive meta-analysis of selected nonhuman primate 
species identif i ed components signif i cantly involved 
in both of these aspects of the stress response.

The conclusion of this study emphasizes the complex relationship between social rank and stress physiology in primate societies. Key points include:
Variability of Rank's Social Meaning
: The concept of "rank" varies across primate species and its physiological implications are equally diverse, extending beyond primates to other species and populations.
Study Context
: The research focused on primates in captivity or benign environments, emphasizing social and psychological stressors over those related to survival like hunger or predation.
Role of Coping Mechanisms
: The impact of social stress is not solely determined by the frequency or severity of stressors but also by the availability and effectiveness of coping strategies, including social support. This suggests that subordination can lead to diverse social and physiological outcomes across different primate societies.
