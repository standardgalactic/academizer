Yes, you can open a folder from Git Bash so that it opens in Windows. Here's how you can do it:
Launch Git Bash on your computer.
Use the
cd
command to navigate to the folder you want to open. For example, if the folder is located at
C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\FolderName
, you would use the following command:
bash
Copy code
cd
/c/Users/YourUsername/Documents/FolderName
Note that you need to use forward slashes (
/
) instead of backslashes (
\
) in the path.
Once you're in the desired folder, type the following command to open the folder in Windows Explorer:
Copy code
explorer .
The
.
represents the current directory.
Press Enter to execute the command. This will open the folder in Windows Explorer, allowing you to browse its contents using the familiar Windows interface.
By using the
explorer
command, you can leverage the integration between Git Bash and Windows to open folders directly in Windows Explorer.
