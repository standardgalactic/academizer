See if you can translate into modem English or explain it. Orpheus' Echoes of the Lost

Oft in the stille of the day,
He gan to wandre forth to stray,
And caste his eyen on the stone
That was y-set in the hille's cone,

And knewe the wonder that ther bide,
Thanne sagh he there, as in a tide,
A wonder geste, as him leste
Of alle the folk that he sagh there

He sagh noght oon that did him care
But al was lost that he hadde y-knowe
And he was to himself unknowe.

He saw a wonder there, but saw no one that caught his attention. All that he had known was lost and he felt unknown to himself.
