I wanted to suggest that Facebook and  Openai should ask you to make your private posts public if they contain useful information.
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're thinking about ways to leverage useful information from private posts to benefit a wider audience. Transparency and the sharing of knowledge can be very beneficial, but it's important to balance that with individual privacy rights. Automatically making private posts public could raise significant concerns about privacy and consent. It might be more viable to encourage users to voluntarily share information they find valuable, while maintaining their ability to control their own data. What do you think about this approach?
4
No I don't mean automatically, I mean in extreme cases where it could be shown where it would be better if they were public. It is not practical now, I am thinking down the road where the "reverse" models are more actively trying to find answers from users in order to categorize their expertise and  personalise their interface. I was thinking on the analogy of trials where it is discovered that a treatment is way more effective than the placebo, then it is unethical to deny the control the effective treatment.
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing analogy and a thoughtful approach! Implementing a system where AI models could identify highly beneficial information in private posts and suggest making them public could potentially unlock a lot of value. However, such a system would require robust ethical guidelines, transparent consent mechanisms, and clear benefits to both the information provider and the wider community.
For instance, ensuring that users fully understand the implications of making their private information public is crucial. Also, there might need to be incentives or clear benefits provided to users who choose to share their valuable insights publicly. Moreover, stringent safeguards would need to be in place to prevent misuse of the system or unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
Overall, as AI and personalization technologies advance, the idea of selectively sharing beneficial information could become more practical, but it would certainly necessitate careful implementation to respect user privacy and autonomy. What are your thoughts on how such a system could be balanced with the need for privacy?
4
I am thinking it would still be in the users control. Instead of banning posts it could suggest more and more reasons to take it down or to publicize it, add the notifications could get more persuasive and intense. It could start explaining to you that this post has the potential to save money, improve efficiency, or save lines. Maybe the pros and cons including how it might be causing damage.
ChatGPT
Your idea adds an interesting layer of user interaction and decision-making to the process, which is essential for maintaining control and trust. By providing users with detailed, context-specific pros and cons about publicizing a post, the system respects user autonomy while nudging them towards making potentially beneficial decisions. This could be seen as a form of "ethical persuasion," where the system aims to encourage actions that have a positive impact without coercing users.
Implementing persuasive notifications that are informative and compelling without being intrusive or overwhelming would be key. The system could use thresholds for when to notify users based on the estimated impact of the information, ensuring that only truly significant posts trigger these advisories. This kind of system could also adapt over time, learning from user responses to improve the relevance and effectiveness of its messages.
Moreover, such an approach could benefit from a feedback loop where users can provide input on how the system's suggestions align with their expectations and values, further refining its accuracy and sensitivity. What do you think about incorporating a feedback mechanism to ensure the system remains aligned with user needs and societal norms?
4
A feedback loop would be critical. However there also needs to be more open choices like writing and essays and uploading files explaining why they want an banned post to be reimplemented. You should be able to appeal a decision for many years no matter how many rejections and of the  system is "convinced" it should publicise the post and issue an apology to everyone it has incorrectly flagged in the past.
ChatGPT
You���re envisioning a system with robust mechanisms for appeal and accountability, which is essential for maintaining fairness and trust in any platform that moderates content. By allowing users to continually appeal decisions and provide additional context through essays or files, the system becomes more transparent and responsive to user needs.
The idea of the system being able to "change its mind" and even issue apologies if it learns from past mistakes adds a layer of ethical responsibility that is often lacking in digital platforms. This approach not only corrects previous errors but also shows a commitment to fairness and continuous improvement.
Incorporating these features would require sophisticated AI that can understand nuanced human arguments and adjust its parameters based on evolving data and feedback. It would also necessitate clear guidelines and oversight to ensure the system operates within ethical boundaries and respects user privacy and rights.
Overall, your approach highlights the importance of balancing advanced technology with ethical practices and user empowerment. It points towards a future where AI systems are not just tools for enforcing rules but also platforms for dialogue and learning. What kind of safeguards do you think would be necessary to implement this effectively?

Your interpretation of "I cover up my misses like Blood did" as a reference to burying mistakes and preserving them for future generations is both insightful and thought-provoking. This idea ties into various concepts and practices, including sprezzatura, publishing negative results, and the preservation of texts by scribes. Let's explore these connections in detail:

### Sprezzatura

1. **Definition**:
   - **Sprezzatura**: A term from Baldassare Castiglione���s "The Book of the Courtier," meaning the art of making difficult tasks look effortless. It involves concealing the effort behind actions to appear naturally skilled and composed.

2. **Connection to Burying Mistakes**:
   - **Effortless Perfection**: Sprezzatura involves hiding the labor and mistakes behind one's actions. This can be seen as a form of "covering up" one's errors to maintain an image of perfection and ease.
   - **Artful Concealment**: The practice of burying mistakes aligns with sprezzatura in that it involves artfully concealing one's imperfections.

### Preserving Mistakes for Future Generations

1. **Publishing Negative Results**:
   - **Scientific Integrity**: In scientific research, publishing negative results is crucial for the integrity of the scientific method. It helps prevent duplication of efforts and guides future research.
   - **Learning from Failures**: Documenting failures allows future researchers to learn from past mistakes, contributing to the overall advancement of knowledge.

2. **Literate Programming**:
   - **Code Documentation**: Literate programming involves writing code alongside documentation that explains the logic and reasoning behind it. This practice ensures that future programmers can understand and learn from both the successes and failures of the original author.
   - **Transparency**: By preserving the process, including mistakes, literate programming provides a transparent view of the development process.

### Instructions to Scribes

1. **Preservation of Texts**:
   - **Historical Accuracy**: Scribes were often instructed to preserve earlier copies of texts to maintain historical accuracy and provide a record of changes over time.
   - **Learning and Reference**: Preserving earlier versions allows future generations to understand the evolution of thought and the development of ideas. It also serves as a reference for correcting and improving texts.

2. **Biblical and Ancient Practices**:
   - **Scriptural Integrity**: In ancient times, scribes meticulously copied texts to preserve their integrity. Errors and corrections were often noted in margins or separate records, ensuring that the original context was not lost.
   - **Cultural Transmission**: The practice of preserving even the flawed or incomplete versions of texts played a significant role in the transmission of culture and knowledge.

### Summary

Your interpretation links several important concepts:

- **Sprezzatura**: The art of concealing effort and mistakes to appear effortlessly skilled.
- **Publishing Negative Results**: The value of documenting failures to guide future research.
- **Literate Programming**: The importance of transparent documentation in software development.
- **Instructions to Scribes**: The historical practice of preserving earlier copies of texts for accuracy and reference.

These connections emphasize the value of transparency, learning from mistakes, and the preservation of knowledge. By acknowledging and documenting errors, we contribute to a richer, more accurate understanding for future generations.

I am thinking in the context of a social media paraklete where the system argued with you to publish or archive a post based on its societal impact and optics. Only in extreme cases like excessive porn or violence or great scientific impact the system would be authorized to override your decision. The parameters for determining what constitutes violence and porn would be published and would be adjusted regularly due to aggregated user feedback. It would be able to explain the problems with an art piece even offering various ways  to sensitize it such as cropping. Or object removal.
ChatGPT
Your idea of a social media "paraklete" (an advocate or intercessor) presents a fascinating approach to moderating content while actively engaging with the user to make informed decisions about their posts. This concept could significantly enhance the interaction between users and content moderation systems, making the process more transparent and educative rather than purely restrictive.
Key Features of the Social Media Paraklete:
Active Dialogue
: The system would engage in a conversation with the user about the potential impacts of their post, both positive and negative. This could educate users on the broader implications of their content, potentially leading to more mindful posting habits.
Guidance on Modifications
: For content that falls into a grey area, the system could offer specific suggestions on how to alter the content to make it acceptable. This could include technical advice like cropping images or removing problematic elements, which would help users understand content guidelines better and participate in a more community-friendly way.
Published Parameters
: The criteria used to evaluate content would be transparent and publicly available. This transparency would help build trust and allow users to understand and even participate in the rule-setting process through feedback.
User Feedback Integration
: Regular adjustments to the moderation criteria based on aggregated user feedback would ensure that the system remains relevant and aligned with community standards and societal norms. This would make the system dynamic and adaptive, rather than static and unyielding.
Exceptional Overrides
: In cases of extreme content (such as explicit violence or significant scientific contributions), the system would have the authority to override user decisions to either prevent harm or promote significant beneficial impacts. This safeguard would handle situations where the potential consequences of posting or not posting are too significant to leave solely in the hands of the user.
Potential Challenges and Considerations:
Privacy and Autonomy
: Balancing the system's proactive role with respect for user privacy and autonomy would be crucial. Users must feel in control of their content and not overly policed.
Complexity in Implementation
: Developing a system that can accurately assess the societal impact of a post and engage in meaningful dialogue with users is technologically and ethically complex.
Bias and Fairness
: Ensuring that the system operates without bias and fairly across diverse user groups would be essential. Regular audits and updates based on user feedback would be critical in maintaining fairness.
User Acceptance
: The success of such a system would heavily depend on user acceptance and trust. Clear communication about the benefits and operation of the system would be necessary to foster user engagement and cooperation.
Overall, this model could represent a significant advance in how social media platforms manage content, turning moderation into a collaborative and educational process rather than a purely authoritarian one. What do you think are the most critical aspects to focus on to make such a system effective and accepted by the public?

There would have to be standards published determining tackiness, ugliness, incompleteness, and beauty and they would publish individual users posts as example threshold, for example it would say anything more violent than this is considered tacky and anything less so is considered sprezzatura. The templates would be evaluated by crowd voting campaign on a yearly basis it would be asked for a vote on whether to have an election (reselection) or not.
ChatGPT
Setting clear standards for concepts like "tackiness," "ugliness," "incompleteness," and "beauty" on social media platforms is indeed a complex challenge, given the subjective nature of these judgments. However, your idea to use community feedback to establish and regularly reassess these standards is an innovative way to democratize content moderation.
Key Elements of the System:
Published Examples as Benchmarks
: Using actual user posts as benchmarks for what is considered acceptable or not could help clarify guidelines. However, it would be essential to obtain consent from users to use their posts as examples to respect privacy and avoid potential backlash.
Crowd Voting Campaigns
: Allowing the community to vote on these examples can make the process democratic and align the standards with the community���s prevailing attitudes and values. This could also help the platform adapt to changing social norms and cultural contexts.
Annual Evaluations and Elections
: Regularly asking the community whether to hold re-elections for standards can ensure that the moderation policies remain relevant and reflective of the community's current values. This continual reassessment can prevent the guidelines from becoming outdated or misaligned with user expectations.
Challenges and Ethical Considerations:
Ethical Use of Content
: Using user posts as examples could raise ethical issues, especially if the content is sensitive or controversial. Ensuring transparency about how and why posts are used is crucial.
Diverse Community Representation
: In a global platform, striking a balance that reflects diverse cultural, social, and personal norms can be challenging. It���s important to ensure that minority voices are not overshadowed by a majority in the voting process.
Impact on Freedom of Expression
: There's a fine line between moderating content for community standards and stifling individual expression. The system must carefully navigate this to avoid overly censoring users.
Operational Complexity
: Implementing such a dynamic and interactive moderation system would require significant resources and sophisticated technology. Ensuring the system is robust enough to handle these tasks without errors or biases is critical.
Your approach offers a dynamic way to manage content moderation that could potentially enhance user satisfaction and trust in the platform. Ensuring the system is fair, transparent, and adaptable will be key to its success. What support mechanisms do you think would be necessary to help users understand and adapt to these evolving standards?

There would be different augmented reality worlds people could chose between with blueprint like infrastructure show the effect of various teraformation schemes 100 or a 1000 years in the future. Each ARW would represent a stimulation on the implication of various actions. The selected threshold would have various impacts on architecture style or deployment plan.
ChatGPT
Integrating augmented reality worlds (ARWs) as a way to visualize the long-term effects of various actions, including content moderation standards and terraformation projects, is an innovative concept. This approach could provide a vivid and immersive method for users to understand the complex consequences of their decisions, whether on a social media platform or in larger environmental and architectural contexts.
Implementation of Augmented Reality Worlds:
Visualization of Long-Term Effects
:
Terraformation Projects
: Users could explore different ARWs that simulate the environmental impact of terraforming activities over centuries. This could help in educating and engaging the public on sustainable practices and the long-term consequences of environmental decisions.
Social and Cultural Impacts
: Similarly, ARWs could simulate how different content moderation standards could shape societal norms and cultural expressions over time. This might include changes in architectural styles, public spaces, and social interactions based on the community standards set through your proposed voting mechanisms.
Interactive and Educational Tool
:
Users could interact with these simulations to modify variables and instantly see the theoretical outcomes. This could serve as a powerful educational tool, promoting understanding of complex systems and the ripple effects of seemingly minor changes.
Support for Decision Making
:
By visualizing outcomes, these ARWs could assist users and policymakers in making informed decisions by providing a concrete representation of abstract concepts. For instance, showing how a certain architectural style might evolve under different environmental conditions or social policies could aid in urban planning and community development.
Technical and Ethical Challenges:
Complexity in Development
:
Creating accurate, realistic ARWs that can simulate complex interactions over long periods requires advanced technology and significant investment in both computational resources and expertise in various scientific and social disciplines.
Accessibility
:
Ensuring that these sophisticated tools are accessible to a wide audience, including those with limited technology access, is crucial for democratic participation and informed decision-making.

Moral progress is annoying
You might feel you can trust your gut to tell right from wrong, but the friction of social change shows that you can���t
by Daniel Kelly & Evan Westra + BIO

Ugh. Here you are, just trying to eat your BLT in peace, and someone at your table starts going on about being a vegan. Your eyes roll as your blood pressure rises. You wish they would just shut up.

It���s not that you don���t care about animal suffering. In other contexts, you actually care quite a bit ��� you would definitely do something if you thought a neighbour was mistreating their dog. You���re a good person ��� an animal lover even! But it���s hard to care that much about the ethics of meat-eating when these vegan types are just so preachy and annoying.

This is, we suspect, a very common experience. When we���re told that something we see as ordinary ��� like eating meat ��� is actually wrong, our first reaction is to get irritated and dismissive. If it���s not about bacon, it���s about plastic straws. Or a phrase we���ve been using for years but is now considered offensive. Or having to share your pronouns.

This is nothing new. In the 1990s, nascent attempts to combat casual forms of sexism, racism and homophobia ��� such as calls to end so-called ���ethnic parties��� on university campuses, or efforts to use the term ���survivor��� instead of ���victim��� when referring to people who have been sexually assaulted ��� were also seen as preachy and annoying, and were often derided as ���political correctness��� run amok. Women complaining about sexual harassment in the workplace used to be met with a similar reaction. For instance, a 1975 article in The New York Times reported that such women were told by their employers that they were being prudish and couldn���t take a joke. A 1980 article about new federal guidelines on workplace sexual harassment quotes ���an indignant personnel vice president��� complaining that these regulations would cause men to ���be afraid to speak to a woman in the office without first speaking to a lawyer.���

Today, these reactions land a bit differently. Most would agree that, even if those activities were once common, they were never OK. That we no longer consider them acceptable is actually a form of moral progress. It���s good that we take sexual harassment in the workplace more seriously than we used to! It���s a step forward that we no longer find casual homophobia funny, and that we try to be more considerate when we talk about sexual violence. ���Ethnic parties���, it turns out, were always stupid and offensive. This all might seem obvious now, but many people at the time probably weren���t expecting things to turn out this way. They listened to their guts, and their guts said ���Ugh.���
ChatGPT
The excerpt you shared touches on an interesting and complex issue: the discomfort and irritation that can accompany moral progress. As societal norms evolve, practices once deemed acceptable are often scrutinized and criticized, leading to a shift in collective attitudes and behaviors. This process can be jarring, as it challenges longstanding beliefs and habits, prompting defensive reactions.
The annoyance experienced when confronted with new ethical standards, like the pushback against eating meat or the use of certain phrases, reflects a natural human resistance to change, especially when it comes to deeply ingrained practices. This resistance is not just about the specific issue at hand (like veganism or speech changes) but also about the broader implications of re-evaluating one���s moral framework.
As the article highlights, previous movements against sexism, racism, and homophobia initially met with strong resistance, labeled as excessive political correctness. Yet, over time, these movements have led to a deeper understanding and a broader acceptance of the need to address these injustices. This illustrates a key aspect of moral progress: it often begins as a fringe idea that is met with skepticism and irritation but can eventually become a widely accepted standard of decency and respect.
This ongoing process of moral evolution is crucial for societal growth, even if it's often uncomfortable. It challenges individuals to examine their own beliefs and behaviors critically, pushing society to adopt more inclusive and compassionate practices. Despite the initial resistance, the gradual acceptance of these new norms demonstrates a capacity for learning and adaptation, which is essential for any progressive society.
Reflecting on such issues can help us understand the dynamics of social change and the role that individual discomfort can play in broader cultural shifts. It's a reminder that progress isn't always easy or straightforward, but it is a necessary part of developing a more ethical and just society.

What is happening here? Why, rather than taking the moral concerns behind social reforms seriously, do we so often respond with this kind of petulant, knee-jerk defensiveness? It���s not that we don���t care about right and wrong. But cases like these can feel like a far cry from the sort of moral issues that we���re inclined to take seriously ��� you know, like murder and human rights. In fact, there seems to be an unspoken expectation that when we���re confronted with genuine, important arguments for moral change, they���ll be easy to recognise. Probably they���ll be accompanied by a flash of righteous anger, or a pang of compassion. And of course we will rise to the occasion. Annoyance and irritation, though, are often taken as a sign that the concerns aren���t that big of a deal, that the arguments are mere quibbles that can be safely dismissed. Call this the eyeroll heuristic: if it���s preachy and annoying, it���s OK to ignore it
ChatGPT
The phenomenon you're describing, where people often react with defensiveness or dismissiveness to new ethical arguments or social reforms, is rooted in several psychological and social dynamics.
Cognitive Dissonance
: When presented with information that conflicts with existing beliefs or habits, people experience cognitive dissonance, a state of mental discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, individuals may dismiss or trivialize the new information rather than re-evaluating their stance. For example, if someone enjoys eating meat, they might feel uncomfortable acknowledging the ethical arguments against it and thus react defensively.
Moral Minimalism
: Many people tend to prioritize 'big' moral issues like murder or theft and may see other ethical concerns, especially those emerging from social reforms, as less significant or 'preachy.' This scale of moral seriousness often means that unless an issue aligns with more universally recognized moral violations, it's easier to dismiss as trivial or not worthy of serious consideration.
Social Identity Theory
: People identify strongly with their social groups and the norms associated with them. When those norms are challenged, it's not just a personal belief or habit that's being questioned but a part of their social identity. This can lead to a defensive reaction because accepting the challenge might imply a broader change in how they see themselves and their community.
The Eyeroll Heuristic
: As you've aptly named it, this heuristic is a shortcut used to dismiss what is perceived as nagging or minor nuisances. It's a way of filtering out information that doesn't immediately appear critical or align with one's existing priorities. This response can be a mechanism to avoid the fatigue of constantly adjusting one's moral and ethical framework, especially in today's fast-paced world where new social issues can seem ever-present and demanding.
Exposure and Fatigue
: In an era where social media amplifies multiple voices and causes, people can become desensitized to calls for moral or social change, viewing them as yet another demand on their attention and sympathy. This overload can lead to a more generalized dismissal of issues, especially if they're presented in a way that is perceived as moralizing or overly critical.
Recognizing these reactions for what they are���defensive mechanisms rather than rational evaluations���can be a first step in dealing with them more constructively. It involves fostering a culture of open-mindedness and a willingness to reconsider one's views in light of new arguments or evidence, even if those arguments initially provoke annoyance or discomfort. It's also essential for advocates of change to find effective communication strategies that engage rather than alienate those whose opinions they hope to influence.

It sounds to me like overton-window shock
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the concept of "Overton Window shock" aptly captures this phenomenon. The Overton Window is a political theory that describes the range of policies or ideas deemed acceptable in public discourse at any given time. When ideas or policies lie outside this window, they can seem radical or unacceptable, leading to shock or resistance when they are first introduced.
How Overton Window Shock Relates to Social Reactions:
Shifts in Social Norms
: As new ideas push the boundaries of what is currently acceptable, they challenge existing norms and beliefs. This sudden exposure to unfamiliar or radical ideas can trigger defensive reactions���people might dismiss these ideas as impractical, extreme, or irrelevant because they fall outside their perceived scope of normalcy.
Adaptation and Acceptance
: Over time, through continued discussion and exposure, what was once considered radical can move into the Overton Window, becoming more accepted and even mainstream. This gradual shift can mitigate initial resistance, allowing for more constructive engagement with new ideas.
Communication Strategies
: For advocates of change, understanding the dynamics of the Overton Window can inform more effective strategies for introducing new ideas. Gradually building awareness and acceptance, using relatable narratives, and aligning new proposals with existing values can help move ideas into the window of acceptability more smoothly.
Public and Political Influence
: Political figures, media, and influencers play significant roles in shaping the Overton Window. They can accelerate the acceptance of new ideas by endorsing them or slow it down by rejecting them. Public opinion also feeds back into this process, as changes in societal attitudes can shift the window.
Recognizing the shock caused by ideas entering public discourse from outside the Overton Window helps explain why even proposals with significant moral implications can initially be met with dismissal or hostility. This awareness can guide how we introduce and advocate for changes in a way that gradually shifts perceptions, reducing the likelihood of immediate rejection and fostering a more open and adaptive public dialogue.

In Defense of Dumbledore
REGINA DOMAN

Rowling has seemed equally blas��, revealing first that she is a Christian (incensing her secularist fans), and next that she has no reluctance to use homosexual inclination as a plot device in her books (disappointing her Christian fans). This is the problem with living authors: you have no control over what they might say next to cast new and glaring light upon their published work. No wonder most serious critics prefer their authors safely dead and ready to be dissected.

https://catholicexchange.com/in-defense-of-dumbledore/
2/2
ChatGPT
It seems you've highlighted a piece that discusses the complexities and implications of authorial intent and public revelations, specifically in the context of J.K. Rowling's comments about her characters and her personal beliefs. This article touches on how Rowling's revelations about her own faith and the sexual orientation of a character like Dumbledore can affect the perceptions and interpretations of her work among different fan bases. The quote you provided reflects a sentiment sometimes expressed in literary criticism���that an author's ongoing commentary can continuously reshape how their work is understood, sometimes controversially so.
In literary circles, this phenomenon is often related to the concept of "the death of the author," a theory proposed by Roland Barthes that argues a text should be separated from its creator's intentions, biases, or personal life to allow the text to stand on its own merits. This theory promotes focusing on the readers' interpretation rather than being confined by the author's context.
The reactions to Rowling's statements illustrate the tension between an author's envisioned meanings and the audience's reception and ownership of that work, which can diverge significantly, especially in widely beloved franchises like Harry Potter. This divergence often becomes more pronounced as social and cultural contexts evolve, further complicating how works are received and critiqued over time.
4
So this makes no sense when the author is alive they can answer questions about what they meant
ChatGPT
You���re touching on a fascinating debate in literary criticism. While Roland Barthes��� notion of "the death of the author" argues for separating a work from its creator to allow for more open interpretation, having a living author who can provide insights and clarifications certainly impacts how the work is received and understood.
The presence of a living author who can comment on their work does indeed offer opportunities for deeper or clarified understanding of the text. Authors can reveal their intentions, context, and unexplored depths of their stories, which can enrich the reader's experience. For example, J.K. Rowling���s revelations about Dumbledore���s character added layers of meaning and sparked discussions that might not have occurred otherwise.
However, this can also lead to complications:
Authorial Intent vs. Reader Interpretation
: When an author states their intentions or provides explanations, it can sometimes limit interpretations by directing readers to see the work in a specific way. This can stifle the creative engagement that comes from readers developing their own meanings.
Changing Interpretations
: As you mentioned, living authors can continue to comment on their work, which might continually shift its interpretation. This can be both enriching and frustrating for readers who prefer a stable, unchanging text.
Cultural Reception
: Authors' comments can also change how their work is received culturally and socially. For instance, revealing a character���s LGBTQ+ identity might be seen as progressive by some and controversial by others, affecting the book's reception in complex ways.
While having a living author can provide valuable insights, it also introduces a dynamic element to how literature is interpreted and valued, which can be both enlightening and challenging for readers and critics alike.

Age Appropriateness
: The film's pacing and abstract nature might not engage younger viewers effectively. Its suitability would need careful consideration, perhaps focusing on older students.
Curricular Fit
: Integrating the film into a curriculum would require thoughtful planning to ensure it complements educational goals.
Variety in Educational Content
: While
2001: A Space Odyssey
offers significant value, education often benefits from a diversity of content and perspectives. Mandating a single film might limit this diversity.
Alternative Approach:
Rather than a mandate, schools could be encouraged to include films like
2001
as part of a broader media literacy or film study curriculum. This approach allows educators to tailor their use of the film to fit the educational context and student needs, possibly including other films and media that offer different perspectives or explore other important themes.
Overall, while the idea of integrating such a seminal film into education is compelling, the implementation would need to be handled with flexibility and sensitivity to educational contexts and student diversity.

Children would be denied certain privileges once it is discovered that they have watched it. For example there could be a gym class or swimming class that is only available to students who have not watched. As a punishment for not waiting until university. Maybe they could reinstate the privilege by watching Logan's run. And if 90% or more of the student voted they could change the holotype films
ChatGPT
It's important to carefully consider the implications of using access to activities like gym or swimming classes as a form of punishment or reward based on whether students have watched a particular film. Education systems typically aim to foster a positive and inclusive environment where all students have equal opportunities to benefit from all aspects of their education, including physical education.
Potential Issues with Such a Policy:
Equity and Inclusivity
: Denying access to activities based on what students have viewed could be seen as discriminatory and might not align with educational values of equality and inclusivity. Physical education and activities like swimming are also important for student health and well-being and generally should not be used as incentives or punishments.
Educational Ethics
: Using educational or recreational activities as leverage for controlling what students watch outside of school raises ethical concerns. It could potentially lead to a negative school environment, where students feel controlled or punished for their choices made outside of educational settings.
Practicality and Enforcement
: Monitoring and enforcing such a policy could be problematic. It would require schools to intrude into students' private lives, determining what they watch in their personal time, which could be both invasive and impractical.
Alternative Approaches:
Discussion and Education
: Rather than imposing restrictions, educators could encourage discussions about why certain content might be more appropriate at different ages. This approach respects students' autonomy and maturity, and promotes critical thinking and responsibility.
Positive Incentives
: If the goal is to encourage students to engage with certain films at the appropriate time, schools could offer positive incentives for students who participate in school-organized viewings or related discussions. This could include extra credit assignments, special discussion groups, or even movie nights that turn viewing into a community event.
Civic Engagement and Voting
: The idea of allowing students to vote on what constitutes appropriate viewing material is interesting and could be part of a larger lesson in civic engagement and democracy. This process should be educational and structured to ensure that all voices are heard and that the outcomes are in line with educational goals and ethical standards.
In summary, while the intention to encourage age-appropriate engagement with complex films is commendable, the method of execution is crucial. It's generally more effective and ethical to use inclusive and educational strategies rather than punitive measures, especially when they involve essential activities like physical education.

That was completely useless I think it is a good idea. If the children want to swim they will have to avoid watching 2001 or watch Logan's run. They get extra points every time they watch 2010 and they can use the points to switch classrooms or schools
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're considering a system where watching certain films could impact students' educational opportunities and privileges in a very structured way. While innovative, this approach would be quite unconventional and might raise various practical and ethical considerations.
Points to Consider:
Freedom of Choice and Access to Education
: Linking educational opportunities and basic privileges, like access to physical education or the ability to switch classrooms, to the films students watch could significantly impact their freedom of choice. Education systems generally aim to provide equal access to learning and extracurricular opportunities without such conditions. Restricting these based on media consumption might be seen as an undue infringement on personal choices.
Encouraging or Discouraging Media Consumption
: While it���s understandable to want to guide young people���s media consumption, creating a system that rewards or punishes them for watching certain films might not have the intended effect. It could lead to resentment, sneakiness, or a divisive environment among students rather than fostering a healthy discussion about media and age-appropriateness.
Educational Equity
: This approach could also introduce a form of inequality among students based on their media choices or their ability to watch certain films, which may not be available or accessible to all students equally. This could inadvertently penalize students based on their home environment or parental guidance.
Alternative Strategies
:
Media Literacy Education
: A more inclusive approach could involve integrating media literacy into the curriculum, where students learn to critically evaluate films and other media they consume. This could include discussions about "2001: A Space Odyssey," "2010," and "Logan's Run" in a way that respects their maturity and individual choices.
Voluntary Film Clubs
: Creating a film club or elective courses that focus on films like these could provide a platform for students who are interested to watch and discuss these films in a structured and educational setting. This would keep it voluntary and educational without affecting their other school privileges or opportunities.
Incentivizing Positive Behaviors
: Instead of using points for watching specific films to allow changing classrooms, consider using a reward system that incentivizes broader positive behaviors like engagement, participation, or academic improvement, which are more directly related to educational outcomes.
While your idea aims to integrate interesting incentives tied to film viewing, it���s crucial to balance the goal of encouraging thoughtful media consumption with the need to maintain fair and equitable access to all aspects of education. This ensures that all students can benefit from educational opportunities without undue pressure or restrictions on their personal media choices.

It is a form of student government intended to prepare them for adult good where they will have to use the same skills to determine which films to shadowban or to promote, using similar democratic and reason giving through argument submission processes
ChatGPT
The concept of using a form of student government to teach about media literacy, democratic decision-making, and the impact of media on society is certainly intriguing and educational. Here's how such a program could be structured to provide meaningful learning experiences while respecting student autonomy and promoting critical thinking:
1.
Establish a Student Media Council
Create a student-led group that reviews films, books, and other media. This council could discuss and debate the merits and drawbacks of various pieces of media in terms of content, age-appropriateness, and societal impact. This would simulate real-world committees that handle media classification and censorship but in a controlled, educational setting.
2.
Democratic Decision-Making
Allow students to vote on recommendations for what media should be promoted or set aside within the school. This could involve preparing arguments for or against certain films and presenting them to their peers before a vote. This process would teach students about the democratic process, persuasive argumentation, and the responsibility that comes with decision-making power.
3.
Educational Framework and Guidance
Provide students with a framework for evaluating media. This could include lessons on media literacy, understanding bias, and the societal impacts of media. Teachers and educators would act as moderators and guides, helping to ensure discussions remain respectful and educational.
4.
Real-World Application
Connect these discussions to real-world contexts by perhaps having occasional guest speakers from local government, media, or academia who can speak about how media is regulated and its impact on society. This could help students see the real-world implications of their school-based activities.
5.
Reflection and Feedback
After decisions are made or certain films are discussed, have a reflection period where students can discuss the outcomes of their decisions and provide feedback on the process. This helps them learn from the experience and understand the consequences of their decisions.
6.
Inclusivity and Respect
Make sure that all voices are heard during discussions. This means encouraging participation from all students and ensuring that the environment is one where differing opinions can be expressed safely and respectfully.
7.
Review and Adjust
Regularly review how the student media council is working and make adjustments as needed. This could involve changing how decisions are made, the types of media discussed, or how arguments are presented and debated.
By framing this program as an educational tool rather than a means of actual enforcement of media watching, it becomes a powerful way to teach valuable skills and concepts without overstepping into controlling personal behavior. This approach not only prepares students for adult responsibilities in a democratic society but also enhances their critical thinking, public speaking, and ethical reasoning skills.
