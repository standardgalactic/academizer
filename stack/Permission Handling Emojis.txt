A typical bug At one place of employment we had a tool that would add users to a given host by gathering the login information for all the users, ssh(1) to each host and update /etc/passwd using the host���s native tools (such as useradd(8), etc.). Many a system admin-istrator has written a similar tool, and for the most part, this program worked reasonably well. (We will discuss how to better manage user accounts across large numbers of machines later in this book.) But all software fails eventually, and for one reason or another I had to debug the tool. Groveling through a few hundred lines of perl that had clearly been written by dif f erent people in dif f erent stages of their career, I came across a code block that included the following call:
chmod(0666, "/dev/null");
Asking around, it became clear that somehow some of the systems ended up in a state where /dev/null was unreadable or -writable by normal users, which leads to a number of complications. But nobody had been able to track down just how exactly this happened until one day we were lucky enough to witness the change in permissions, but the only activity by a user with suf f i cient privileges to make such a change was a sudo(8) invocation of less(1).
less(1) happens to make use of a history f i le to remember search com-mands between invocations, much like your shell may use a history f i le (such as ~/.bash_history). less(1) is aware of the fact that the his-tory f i le might contain sensitive information, and it actively changes the permissions on that f i le to only allow read/write access to the owner.

This anecdote highlights an interesting and somewhat amusing bug in a system administration tool. The tool, written in Perl and developed over time by various programmers at different career stages, was intended to add users to various hosts by updating
/etc/passwd
using tools like
useradd(8)
. While generally effective, an odd bug was encountered: the permissions of
/dev/null
were being altered to be unreadable or unwritable by normal users.
The mystery deepened until it was observed that the only significant activity when the permissions changed was a
sudo(8)
invocation of
less(1)
. The culprit turned out to be
less(1)
itself, which, like many programs, uses a history file to remember past commands. To protect potentially sensitive information in this history file,
less(1)
modifies the file's permissions to restrict access only to the owner.
The interesting point here is the unintended side effect of this security measure. While
less(1)
was responsibly managing its history file, it inadvertently affected the permissions of
/dev/null
, a critical file in Unix and Linux systems used for various purposes, including discarding unwanted output. This change in permissions of
/dev/null
could lead to unexpected behavior and issues in a multi-user environment, as normal users would be unable to read from or write to it.
This story serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities of software interactions in a system, where a seemingly innocuous action (like modifying file permissions for security) can have unforeseen and far-reaching effects on system functionality. It also underscores the importance of thorough testing and understanding the broader implications of code changes, especially in systems-level programming.

But for the root user, we explicitly symlinked all common such history f i les to /dev/null to avoid accidental leaking of secrets to disk.
And therein lies the bug: less(1) was invoked by the super user, it would check the permissions on the f i le /root/.lesshst, follow the redirection to /dev/null find that they���re not 0600 and call chmod(2), yielding and unreadable/unwritable /dev/null. We were able to conf i rm this be-haviour and identif i ed a code change in later versions of less(1) that fixed this problem.
Understanding such failures and identifying their root causes requires a deep understanding of the operating system and its tools, but tracking down bugs like this[1] is just one of the many aspects of a System Ad-ministrator���s daily routine.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The detailed explanation reveals the root cause of the bug: the history file of
less(1)
was symlinked to
/dev/null
for the root user to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. When
less(1)
was run as the superuser, it would check the permissions of its history file, which in this case was
/dev/null
. Finding the permissions not set to 0600,
less(1)
would attempt to change them, inadvertently affecting the permissions of
/dev/null
. This resulted in
/dev/null
becoming unreadable and unwritable for other users.
This scenario is a classic example of an unexpected interaction between different components of a system. The intention behind symlinking history files to
/dev/null
for the root user was to enhance security. However, it led to an unforeseen consequence due to the way
less(1)
managed its history file's permissions.
The resolution came with a code change in later versions of
less(1)
, which presumably included a check or a different approach to handle symlinked history files, thus avoiding the alteration of
/dev/null
permissions.
This story illustrates a key aspect of system administration: the need for a deep understanding of the operating system and its tools. Identifying and resolving such intricate bugs is a critical part of a System Administrator's role, demanding thorough knowledge and meticulous attention to detail. It also serves as a reminder of the intricacies of Unix/Linux systems where even small changes can have significant and unexpected impacts on the overall system behavior.

What would 600 be equivalent to in rwx and binary coded decimal?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The permissions
600
in a Unix or Linux system are represented in octal format and refer to the read and write permissions for the owner of the file, with no permissions for the group and others.
In the
rwx
(read, write, execute) format,
600
translates to:
r
(read) = 4
w
(write) = 2
x
(execute) = 1
So,
600
in octal would be:
Owner:
read
and
write
permissions (
4 + 2 = 6
), which is
rw-
Group: no permissions (
0
), which is
---
Others: no permissions (
0
), which is
---
Therefore,
600
in
rwx
format is
rw-------
.
In binary coded decimal (BCD), which represents each digit of the octal number individually in binary,
600
would be converted as follows:
6
in binary is
110
0
in binary is
000
So,
600
in binary coded decimal would be
110 000 000
.

I think it is like counting in binary: 001, 010, 011, 100 - --x, -w-, -wx, r--, where a zero is -, and if it's in an initial position it's an r, in medial position a w, and in final position an x, in each group of three digits.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, you've accurately described the system! Unix/Linux file permissions are indeed based on binary counting. Each digit in the permission number represents a different set of permissions (read, write, execute), and the presence of a permission is indicated by a
1
(or its absence by a
0
).
Here's how it breaks down for each set of three digits (representing the owner, group, and others, respectively):
The first position (from the right) is for
execute
permissions:
1
(or
x
) means execute permission is granted.
0
(or
-
) means no execute permission.
The second position is for
write
permissions:
1
(or
w
) means write permission is granted.
0
(or
-
) means no write permission.
The third position is for
read
permissions:
1
(or
r
) means read permission is granted.
0
(or
-
) means no read permission.
So, when you see a permission like
754
in octal, it represents:
7
in binary is
111
(rwx)
5
in binary is
101
(r-x)
4
in binary is
100
(r--)
Thus,
754
translates to
rwx r-x r--
.
This binary representation aligns with the Unix philosophy of using simple, binary-based systems for permissions, making it straightforward yet flexible.

The current paradigm of AI: agnostic deep neural networks (dNNs) 
AnAIapplicationisacomputer programthatcancreateanoutputinresponsetoinput 
data in a way that is similar to the ways humans react to corresponding environmental 
stimuli. In what follows we will focus on AI applications that work with natural 
language input, where the currently dominant paradigm is provided by what is called 
agnostic deep machine learning.1The latter is a subf i eld of applied mathematics in 
which input-output-tuples of data are used to create stochastic models, in a process 
often (somewhat simplistically) referred to as ���training���. The inputs are connected to 
outputs probabilistically, which means that there is a certain (a priori unknown but measurable) likelihood that a given input will be associated with a given output. The 
models are referred to as ���stochastic��� because they work by utilizing the fact that the 
data on which they draw is probabilistic in this sense. The models are, in addition, 
���agnostic������which means that they do not rely on any prior knowledge about the task 
or about the types of situations in which the task is performed, and they are often 
���end to end,��� which means that they are meant to model an entire process such as 
answering a letter or driving a car. The models are, i nally, ���deep��� in the sense that 
their architecture involves multiple layers of networks of computational units (thus 
not, for example, because of any depth in their semantics) 
For agnostic deep learning to be useable in creating an AI application, a number of 
conditions must be satisf i ed: 
1. A suff i cient body of training data must be available in the form of tuples of 
input and output data. These are digital mappings of, respectively, a situation in 
response to which an action is required, and an action of the corresponding sort 
(Hastie et al. 2008). A classical AI-application in this sense is the spam i lter, 
whose initial output data were created using annotations, in this case adding the 
label ���spam��� to email inputs. 
2. Computers must receive the training material in digital form, so that it can be 
processed using the computing resources available today (Cooper 2004). 
3. The annotated training tuples must be reasonably consistent (noise-poor)���that 
is, similar inputs should lead to similar outputs. This is because machine learning 
requires repetitive patterns���patterns that have arisen in a recurring, rather than 
erratic, process. The behaviour of human email users when identifying spam 
forms a repetitive process of the needed sort. The reason for this is that users of 
email have a motive to become experts in successful identif i cation of spam, since 
they are aware of the high costs of failure. The movement of the oil price over 
time, in contrast, is an example of an erratic process. This is because the input 
data pertaining to geopolitical and economic events bear no consistent relation to 
the output data, for example the price of Brent crude. 
4. Thedatainputmustbeabundant,sinceamachine-learningalgorithmisastochas- 
tic model that needs to represent as much as possible of the variance which 
characterises the situation in which the model is to be used. Because in language 
applications the overall complexity of the relationship between input and output 
is typically very high, the models will need many parameters. For mathematical 
reasons these parameters can only be estimated (through the type of optimisation 
process otherwise called ���training���) on the basis of huge data sets. If the training 
sets are too small, there is a high chance that novel input data will not have the 
properties of the data sampled in the training distribution. The model will then 
not be able to produce an adequate output under real production conditions.

The excerpt from "Making AI Meaningful Again" by Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith discusses the current paradigm of AI, particularly focusing on agnostic deep neural networks (dNNs) and their application in natural language processing. Here are the key points:
AI Applications and Natural Language Processing
: AI applications are defined as computer programs that produce outputs in response to inputs, similar to human reactions to environmental stimuli. The focus here is on applications that work with natural language input, using the paradigm of agnostic deep machine learning.
Agnostic Deep Machine Learning
: This approach is a subfield of applied mathematics where input-output data tuples are used to create stochastic models through a process often referred to as "training." These models connect inputs to outputs probabilistically, meaning they predict outputs based on the likelihood associated with given inputs. The models are:
"Stochastic": They operate on the basis that the data they use is probabilistic.
"Agnostic": They do not rely on prior knowledge about the task or the context of the task.
"End to End": They are designed to model an entire process, like answering a letter or driving a car.
"Deep": Their architecture involves multiple layers of networks of computational units.
Conditions for Effective Deep Learning
:
Sufficient Training Data
: A large body of input-output data tuples is needed. A classical example is a spam filter, where initial output data were labeled as "spam."
Digital Processing of Training Material
: Computers must receive training material in digital form to be processed using available computing resources.
Consistency in Training Data
: Annotated training tuples must be reasonably consistent, meaning similar inputs should lead to similar outputs. Machine learning relies on repetitive patterns.
Abundant Data Input
: Machine learning algorithms require large datasets to capture the variance in the situation for which the model is designed, especially in language applications where the relationship between input and output is complex.
Challenges in Modeling Complex Systems
: The paper suggests that due to the high complexity in the relationship between input and output in language applications, deep learning models require many parameters, which can only be effectively estimated with large datasets. If the training sets are too small, the model may not perform adequately in real-world conditions due to novel input data not matching the properties of the training data.
This analysis points out the intricacies and challenges of using deep learning for AI applications, especially in the context of language processing, and highlights the importance of training data, model design, and the underlying mathematical principles.

What is the ���it��� in each of these sentences? To resolve anaphora requires inference

material on the basis of which they were created. Even putting many dNN models 
together in what are called ���ensembles��� does not overcome the problem.16(Kowsari 
et al. 2017). 
And worse: because the dNNs rely exclusively on just those correlations, they are 
also unable to distinguish correlation from causation, as they can model only input- 
output-relationships in ways that are agnostic to questions of, for example, evidence 
and causality. Thus they can detect that there is some sort of relationship between

unless references to this very relation and to relevant types of relata themselves form 
part of the annotated corpus. Unfortunately, to create the needed annotated gold- 
standard corpora���one for each domain of interest���would be hugely expensive in 
terms of both time and human expertise. To make dNNs work effectively in language 
applications thus would require not only enormous collections of data but also, at 
least for many applications��� and certainly for those examples involving the tracing 
of causality���the investment of considerable amounts of human expertise. 
One i nal problem resulting from the properties of dNNs as very long polynomials 
is a lack of transparency and���in contrast to determinstic algorithms���a black box 
operation mode. Therefore, dNN engineers cannot tell why the network yielded its 
output from a given input. This poses a major challenge in areas where we need to 
reproduce or analyse the behaviour of the network, for example in case of disputes 
over liability. 
Taken together, these problems rule out entirely the use of machine learning algo- 
rithms alone to drive mission-critical AI systems���for example with capability such 
as driving cars or managing nuclear power stations or intensive care units in hospitals. 
They are too brittle and unstable against variations in the input, can easily be fooled, 
lack quality and precision, and fail completely for many types of language under- 
standing or where issues of liability can arise. Even at their very best, they remain 
approximative, and so any success they achieve is still, in the end, based on luck.

The section "3.1 Adding Semantics to Automation Solutions" from "Making AI Meaningful Again" by Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith discusses strategies to enhance AI algorithms by incorporating prior knowledge, focusing on overcoming the limitations of current AI systems, particularly in understanding human language. Let's explore the key points:
Incorporation of Prior Knowledge into AI
: The authors emphasize the need to find ways to integrate prior knowledge into AI algorithms. This is seen as a crucial step to overcome the limitations of existing AI models, particularly in understanding complex contexts relevant to human language.
Bayesian Networks with Explicit Relationship Semantics
: One approach mentioned is the enhancement of Bayesian Networks with explicit relationship semantics. This allows model designers to embed knowledge about entity relationships into the models before training. Although this provides some form of prior knowledge, the expressivity of these models is still too limited for complex contexts.
Challenges with Current Models
: Current models, including those enhanced with semantics, are noted to have limitations in exactness, security, robustness against perturbations, and transparency. This leads to a call for "explainable AI", which aims to develop AI systems whose decision-making processes can be understood and interpreted by humans.
Semantics-Based Representation
: The authors propose using a semantics-based representation that aligns with how humans naturally use language and assign meaning. This representation can incorporate prior knowledge even from low to medium amounts of input material, reflecting real-world situations. The emphasis is on understanding meaning as derived from objects, events, and their affordances, as theorized by Gibson in 1979.
Interdisciplinary Approach
: Building this kind of AI application involves not just mathematics and computer science but also philosophy. This approach acknowledges the multifaceted nature of human understanding and reasoning.
Reference to Early Logic-Based AI and Patrick Hayes
: The authors reference the early attempts at creating 'strong' logic-based AI, specifically the work of Patrick Hayes. Hayes, along with John McCarthy, contributed significantly to AI research. They discuss Hayes' concept of 'na��ve physics'���a theory using first-order logic (FOL) to capture common-sense knowledge for navigating the physical world, suggesting the need for encoding a vast number of predicates in FOL axioms to simulate human reasoning about everyday physical objects.
Challenges in Mimicking Human Reasoning
: The problem with Hayes��� approach and strong AI, in general, is the immense complexity and challenge of mimicking even simple human reasoning.
This section of the paper highlights the challenges in developing AI systems that truly understand and process language as humans do. It suggests that a multidisciplinary approach, blending technical, semantic, and philosophical perspectives, is essential for advancing AI towards more meaningful and interpretable applications.

the semantics of human (natural) language. They can be satisf i ed, we believe, only by 
combining stochastic inference components with methods associated with traditional, 
logic-based AI in such a way as to allow incorporation of prior knowledge.

tion of the natural language semantics of the information the system is processing. To 
succeed, this representation needs two major elements: (a) a set of logical formalisms, 
constituted by formal ontologies that enable the storage and manipulation of language 
in Turing machines, and (b) a framework which enables one to def i ne the meanings 
of the elements of the language. 
We can describe only the rough outline of these components here, though one 
important feature, the methodology for development and use of ontologies to which 
we appeal, is described in detail in Arp et al. (2015). 
3.2.2 Representingnaturallanguage 
Natural language as input is of course very hard to express in a logical framework, 
and a typical basic pipeline, which sacrif i ces a considerable part of the semantics in 
order to achieve computability, comprises the following elements:

1. morphologicalandsyntacticalerrorcorrectionofaninputtextusingdNN-models 
trained using large public data resources, 
2. syntactical parsing with the help of a stochastic parser, e.g. a conditional random 
i eld parser as described in Finkel et al. (2008), and 
3. inferenceappliedtotheparseroutputswiththehelpof(computable)propositional 
logic. 
However, to capture the semantics of full natural language, a much stronger, higher 
order intensional logic is required for its computational representation (Gamut 1991), 
andalogicofthissortcannotbeusedforcomputationalpurposes.Toenablecomputa- 
tion, the source text must thus be expressed by combining several computable logical 
dialects which together provide a representation that is adequate for a given context 
and purpose. For example, fundamental language constructs can be represented using 
FOL, while temporal relationships require temporal propositional logic.

In the section "3.2 Inserting Philosophy into AI" from "Making AI Meaningful Again" by Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith, the authors explore how integrating philosophy, particularly formal logic, into AI can enhance automated language processing. Here are the main points:
Combining Stochastic Models with Formal Logic
: The authors propose augmenting stochastic models, including deep neural networks (dNNs), with philosophically driven formal logic. This combination aims to create AI applications capable of solving real-world problems.
Desiderata for AI Systems
: They outline minimal requirements for real-world AI systems, emphasizing that these cannot be met by machine-learning systems alone. Instead, they suggest a combination of stochastic inference and traditional logic-based AI, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge.
Formal Representation of Prior Knowledge
: The approach involves a formal representation of prior knowledge using computable representations of natural language semantics. This requires:
Logical formalisms through formal ontologies for storing and manipulating language in Turing machines.
A framework for defining the meanings of language elements.
Methodology for Developing and Using Ontologies
: While only a rough outline is given, the authors reference a detailed methodology for developing and using ontologies (Arp et al. 2015).
Challenges in Representing Natural Language
: Representing natural language in a logical framework is complex. The basic computational pipeline for processing natural language typically includes:
Morphological and syntactical error correction using dNN models.
Syntactical parsing with a stochastic parser.
Applying inference to parser outputs using computable propositional logic.
Need for Higher-Order Intensional Logic
: To fully capture natural language semantics, a higher-order intensional logic is necessary, which is challenging for computational purposes. To address this, the authors suggest using several computable logical dialects to represent different aspects of language, such as FOL for fundamental constructs and temporal propositional logic for temporal relationships.
This section highlights the need for a more sophisticated approach to AI language processing, one that integrates the rigor of formal logic and the flexibility of stochastic models. By doing so, the authors aim to develop AI systems that can more effectively understand and process human language in a manner that aligns with real-world complexities and nuances.

3.2.4 Incorporatingontologies 
Ontologies can be divided into two types. On the one hand are domain ontologies, 
which are formal representations of the kinds of entities constituting a given domain 
of inquiry and of the relations between such entities (Smith 2003). On the other hand 
are top-level ontologies, which represent the categories that are shared across a max- 
imally broad range of domains���categories such as object, property, process and so 
forth. Each ontology is built around a taxonomic hierarchy in which the types of 
entities are related to each other by the relation of greater and lesser generality (an 
analogueofthesubsetrelationthatholdsbetweentheinstancesofsuchtypes).Domain 
ontologies have enjoyed considerable success in the formalisation of the descriptive

2074Synthese(2021)198:2061���2081 
content of scientif i c theories above all in many areas of biology [see especially the 
Gene Ontology, (Ashburner 2000)], where they served initially as controlled, struc- 
tured vocabularies for describing the many new types of entities discovered in the 
wake of the Human Genome Project. On the other hand are top-level ontologies such 
as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO, (Arp et al. 2015)), which arose to allow domain 
ontologies at lower levels to be created in such a way that they share a common set 
of domain-independent categories. As more and more such domain ontologies came 
to be developed and applied to the annotation and management of more and more 
different types of biological and biomedical data, the use of such a common top level 
allowed the resultant ontologically enhanced data to be more easily combined and 
reasoned over. BFO is now used in this way as shared top-level ontology in some 300 
ontology initiatives.19 
The use of a common top level also allows multiple ontologies to facilitate stan- 
dardised exchange between parties communicating data about entities in different but 
overlappingdomains.Throughtheincorporationofformaldef i nitions,theyalsoallow 
the application of basic inference mechanisms when interpreting data exploiting tax- 
onomic and other relations built into the ontology. For logic-based AI applications, 
ontologies are needed which ref l ect the full spectrum of language constituents and 
of their logical counterparts. They must enable the expression not only of traditional 
taxonomical and mereological relations but also, for example, of synonymy relations 
at both the word and phrase level. 
3.2.4.1. Resolving ambiguity The terms in such ontologies are def i ned using formulae 
of FOL and the way these formulae represent language can be illustrated using the 
second uncertainty example we introduced in Sect. 3.2.3 above.

The section "3.2.4 Incorporating Ontologies" from "Making AI Meaningful Again" by Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith discusses the use of ontologies in AI, particularly for automated language processing. Here's a summary of the key points:
Two Types of Ontologies
:
Domain Ontologies
: These are formal representations of entities and relations within a specific domain of inquiry. They have been particularly successful in biology, as exemplified by the Gene Ontology, which emerged from the Human Genome Project. Domain ontologies provide structured vocabularies to describe new types of entities in specific fields.
Top-Level Ontologies
: These ontologies represent categories shared across a wide range of domains, like 'object', 'property', and 'process'. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is an example, used in about 300 ontology initiatives. BFO enables the creation of domain ontologies with a common set of domain-independent categories, facilitating the combination and reasoning over ontologically enhanced data.
Benefits of Using a Common Top-Level Ontology
: The use of a common top level in multiple domain ontologies allows for standardized data exchange between different but overlapping domains. It also enables the application of basic inference mechanisms and interpretation of data using taxonomic and other relations built into the ontology.
Application in Logic-Based AI
: For logic-based AI applications, ontologies should reflect the full spectrum of language constituents and their logical counterparts. This includes expressing not only traditional taxonomical and mereological relations but also, for example, synonymy relations at both the word and phrase level.
Resolving Ambiguity with Ontologies
: The authors give an example of resolving ambiguity in natural language using formal representation with first-order logic (FOL). In their example, they demonstrate how unary predicates (nouns) and modifiers (indicating syntactical relationships) are used in formal representation to disambiguate a sentence about John searching for his father.
This section highlights the importance of ontologies in enhancing AI's ability to process and understand natural language. By incorporating ontologies, AI systems can be equipped with structured, domain-specific knowledge, as well as a broader understanding of categories common across various domains, enhancing their capacity for language understanding and reasoning.

4 Conclusion 
As becomes clear from the example given in the Appendix below, our approach to 
philosophy-driven language AI is to generate a specif i c system for each application

of this extension to new domains will be accelerated by enhanced ontology authoring

allow for applications such as automated encoding of medical discharge summaries, 
validation of the medical necessity of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and 
automation of customer correspondence.

Beginning with the mathematician-philosopher Gottlob Frege, philosophers have

in 1879, and since then the FOL framework has been ref i ned and extended to the point 
where it is possible to represent natural language in a formal, computable manner.21 
Philosophers have, from the very beginning, attempted to understand how human 
language works and how language relates to the world. (Think of Aristotle���s Organon 
and Book VII of his Metaphysics.) In the 20th century, an entire branch of the 
discipline���called ���analytical philosophy������has grown up around this topic (Dum- 
mett 1996). The computational discipline of ���formal ontology���, has in recent years 
achieved considerable maturity in part as a result of the inf l uence of philosophical

In the conclusion of "Making AI Meaningful Again" by Jobst Landgrebe and Barry Smith, the authors summarize their philosophy-driven approach to language AI and its broader implications. Here are the main points:
Philosophy-Driven Language AI for Specific Domains
: The approach involves creating specific systems for each application domain, moving away from the idea of general artificial intelligence. These are exact, context-and task-specific AI technologies, successfully used in various domains.
Generalizability and Expansion
: The method is generalizable to many types of data. As the range of available ontologies expands and algorithms become more sophisticated, the technology can cover more areas and domains of repetitive work suitable for automation. Progress in ontology authoring and semi-automated generation (like inductive logic programming) will facilitate this expansion.
Practical Applications
: The authors envision practical applications such as automated encoding of medical discharge summaries, validation of medical procedures, and automation in customer correspondence.
Philosophy's Evolving Role in Human Affairs
: The authors reflect on the evolving role of philosophy since the late 19th century, particularly in providing methods to express knowledge in exact logical forms. They credit Gottlob Frege with inventing first-order logic (FOL) in 1879, which has since been refined to represent natural language in a formal, computable manner.
Philosophy and Language Understanding
: Philosophers have long been interested in understanding human language and its relation to the world, contributing to the growth of analytical philosophy and the computational discipline of formal ontology.
Philosophy's Contribution Beyond Academia
: Despite skepticism about philosophy's relevance, the authors argue for its significant impact, including its role in social upheavals, the birth of democracy, market institutions, Cartesian coordinates, and scientific disciplines. They foresee a future role for philosophy in strengthening applied sciences in the digital era, particularly in creating realistic AI applications involving the translation of natural language into computable logical formulae.

Explain the ���� ������������ permission system again
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The ���������������� permission system is a creative way to represent Unix file permissions using emojis. In Unix and Linux systems, file permissions are typically denoted in a numeric (octal) format or using the
rwx
notation, where
r
stands for read,
w
for write, and
x
for execute. In our emoji-based system, each permission (or lack thereof) is represented by a specific emoji:
���� (Apple) represents a lack of permission (or
-
in
rwx
format).
���� (Book) represents read permission (
r
).
���� (Pen) represents write permission (
w
).
���� (Rocket) represents execute permission (
x
).
Each set of three emojis corresponds to a set of permissions for three different categories of users: the owner of the file, the group to which the file belongs, and others. In Unix/Linux, permissions are presented in this order: owner, group, others.
For example, if we have the permission ������������ ������������ ������������, it translates to:
Owner permissions: ������������ (read, write, execute)
Group permissions: ������������ (read, no write, execute)
Others permissions: ������������ (no read, no write, no execute)
This system is a fun and visual way to express the concept of file permissions, making it perhaps more intuitive, especially for those who are more visually oriented.
