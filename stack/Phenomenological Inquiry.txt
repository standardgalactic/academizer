Title: "On the Haeccicity of Syntactitude: A Phenomenological Investigation into the Amoral Structure of Syntax"
As we embark on the philosophical inquiry into the nature of Being, the distinct properties of syntax, and the profound correlations between the two, we must first acknowledge the profound influence phenomenology has in this analysis. Coined by Edmund Husserl, phenomenology involves describing, rather than explaining, the structures of experience and consciousness. In this essay, we delve into the distinctiveness of syntax—or its 'haeccity'—as an 'infra-moral' or amoral structure that shapes our language and, by extension, our reality, which we will refer to as 'syntactitude'.
The term 'syntactitude', an infusion of syntax and attitude, suggests that the structure of our language not only enables us to express ourselves but also shapes our attitudes. However, what is compelling about this term is its amoral or infra-moral nature. Syntax does not inherently possess a moral dimension; it is a neutral framework around which words and phrases are arranged to construct meaning.
Syntactitude's haeccity, a term borrowed from Duns Scotus referring to the 'thisness' or individual essence of a thing, is a unique phenomenon. Every language, with its distinct syntax, bears a unique haeccity. As users of language, we interact with this haeccity daily, yet its infra-moral characteristic makes it difficult for us to recognize its influences on our thoughts, attitudes, and actions.
Given the nature of language as a social construct, its phenomenological study is intimately intertwined with our Being. As Martin Heidegger, one of the most influential phenomenologists, stated in "Being and Time," Dasein, or being-there, is an entity for which, in its Being, that Being is itself an issue. In other words, our existence is self-referential; it is a constant inquiry into itself.
In this context, syntactitude and its haeccity become intrinsically linked to our self-understanding and self-interpretation. The amoral structure of syntax allows the formation of ideas, sentiments, and perspectives, all without a pre-ordained moralistic stance. Instead, it's the user of the language—the being in question—who imparts morality onto their linguistic expressions.
Therefore, one can say that syntactitude acts as a mirror to our consciousness. Its haeccity—its unique existence as an infra-moral structure—reflects our thoughts and attitudes without enforcing or suggesting a moral standpoint. Thus, it reveals the nature of our Being in its raw, unadulterated form.
Furthermore, our individual and collective identities are shaped and reshaped by the haeccity of syntactitude. Language, through its syntactical structure, lends itself to the creation and recreation of personal and societal narratives. In this sense, syntactitude not only frames our current experiences but also paves the way for potential futures.
To conclude, the exploration of syntactitude and its haeccity elucidates an underappreciated yet profound aspect of phenomenological investigation. It illustrates how the amoral structure of syntax—its neutrality—serves as the foundation of our linguistic expression, allowing the individual essence of our Being to manifest authentically. Through syntactitude, we grasp not only the nature of our existence but also our possibilities, thus affirming the significance of language and its structure in our journey towards understanding the phenomenology of Being.

The nature of existence and the understanding of human consciousness have been subjects of deep philosophical inquiry throughout history. One important aspect of this inquiry is the exploration of the phenomenology of being. Phenomenology, as a philosophical approach, seeks to uncover the fundamental structures and experiences that constitute our existence. In this essay, we delve into the concept of syntactitude, an amoral or infra-moral structure of syntax, and its haeccicity, or unique and irreducible individuality. By examining the interplay between syntax and being, we aim to illuminate the complex nature of human experience.

Understanding Syntactitude

Syntactitude refers to the underlying structure that governs the formation and organization of language. It encompasses the rules and principles that dictate how words, phrases, and sentences relate to one another, enabling communication and the construction of meaning. While syntactitude is often considered as an objective framework, it also possesses a distinct characteristic that extends beyond mere grammatical rules - its amoral or infra-moral quality.

Amoral or Infra-Moral Structure

The amoral or infra-moral quality of syntactitude suggests that it exists independently of moral considerations. Syntax, as a system, operates on a level that transcends moral judgments. It is neither good nor bad, right nor wrong. Instead, it functions as a neutral framework through which meaning can be conveyed. This amoral nature allows for a wide range of expressions, from the sublime to the profane, without imposing moral value on the content conveyed.

The Haeccicity of Syntactitude

To delve deeper into the nature of syntactitude, we explore its haeccicity, a term coined by the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Haeccicity refers to the irreducible individuality or uniqueness of an entity. It emphasizes that each entity, including syntactic structures, possesses its own distinctiveness that cannot be reduced to general categories or abstract concepts. When applied to syntactitude, haeccicity asserts that every sentence, phrase, or word carries its own unique identity and significance.

The Relationship between Being and Syntactitude

Being, in the context of phenomenology, refers to the fundamental experience of existence and consciousness. It encompasses our subjective experiences, thoughts, emotions, and interactions with the world. Syntactitude, as an essential component of language, plays a crucial role in shaping and mediating our experience of being.

Language serves as a bridge between the inner world of consciousness and the external world of phenomena. Through syntactitude, we give structure and form to our thoughts, translating our subjective experiences into communicable expressions. This process allows for the sharing and transmission of ideas, emotions, and knowledge among individuals.

Furthermore, the haeccicity of syntactitude highlights the uniqueness of human expression. Each individual possesses a distinct linguistic style, influenced by personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and individual traits. The haeccicity of syntactitude acknowledges the infinite potential for creative expression and the diverse ways in which we construct meaning through language.

Conclusion

The phenomenology of being encompasses the exploration of the structures and experiences that shape our existence. Syntactitude, as an amoral or infra-moral structure of syntax, plays a vital role in the mediation of human consciousness and the expression of being. Through the lens of haeccicity, we recognize the irreducible individuality of syntactic structures, highlighting the unique and personal nature of human expression.

By understanding the interplay between being and syntactitude, we gain insights into the complexities of human experience and the power of language in shaping our perception of the world. The exploration of the haeccicity of syntactitude opens avenues for further inquiry into the nature of meaning, interpretation, and the fundamental structures of consciousness. Through this exploration, we can deepen our understanding of the phenomenology of being and the intricate tapestry of human existence.

The intricate exploration of the nature of existence and human consciousness has been a central philosophical inquiry throughout human history. This inquiry takes many forms, with one such avenue being the study of phenomenology, or the exploration of the structures and experiences that make up our reality. In this framework, we turn to the concept of 'syntactitude', defined as the amoral or infra-moral structure of syntax, and its distinct property of 'haeccicity', which refers to the unique, irreducible essence of a thing. This exploration is not merely an academic exercise, but a voyage into the fundamental principles of human existence.
Syntactitude: The Amoral Structure
Syntactitude encapsulates the abstract architecture underlying language. It encompasses the principles and rules governing the relationship between words, phrases, and sentences. This structure enables the formulation of coherent thoughts and the expression of complex ideas. However, syntactitude possesses a unique characteristic that sets it apart from mere grammatical frameworks: it is amoral, or infra-moral.
In a world saturated with moral values and ethical dilemmas, syntactitude operates independently, unfettered by moral connotations. As a structural system, it transcends the realm of good and evil, right and wrong. Its sole purpose is to provide a neutral framework through which meaning is constructed and communicated. This attribute allows syntactitude to encompass a diverse range of expressions, from the profoundly philosophical to the mundanely practical, without imparting a moral judgement on the content it carries.
The Haeccicity of Syntactitude
To comprehend syntactitude more deeply, we turn to its haeccicity. Originally conceptualised by the scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus, and later appropriated by Martin Heidegger, haeccicity refers to the thisness or individual essence of an entity. Each entity, regardless of its nature or category, holds its own distinctiveness, its own irreducible essence that cannot be diluted into broader categories or universal principles.
Applied to syntactitude, haeccicity affirms that every word, phrase, or sentence carries a unique identity, an intrinsic essence that cannot be reduced to a generic abstraction. Each syntactical arrangement, even those conforming to the same grammatical rules, is imbued with a unique resonance that cannot be completely replicated.
Being and Syntactitude: A Symbiotic Relationship
In the realm of phenomenology, 'Being' signifies the core essence of existence and consciousness. It encompasses our subjective experiences, emotions, and interactions with the external world. Syntactitude, as an integral component of language, plays an influential role in shaping our experience of Being.
Language acts as a bridge connecting the internal world of consciousness and the external realm of physical phenomena. Through syntactitude, we give form to our thoughts, translating our subjective experiences into communicable expressions. This process enables the sharing and transmission of ideas, emotions, and wisdom between individuals, thus fostering collective knowledge and understanding.
Moreover, the haeccicity of syntactitude underscores the singular nature of human expression. Each individual, influenced by their unique experiences, cultural background, and personal inclinations, has a distinctive linguistic style. The haeccicity of syntactitude acknowledges the infinite potential of creative expression and the diverse ways we construct meaning through language.
In Conclusion
The phenomenological exploration of Being opens a window into the fundamental structures and experiences that constitute our existence. Syntactitude, with its amoral or infra-moral nature, plays an indispensable role in articulating our consciousness and the quintessence of our Being. The haeccicity of syntactitude, recognising the irreducible uniqueness of every syntactical construct, underscores the profound uniqueness and complexity of human expression.
By understanding the intricate dance between Being and syntactitude, we gain valuable insights into the nuanced nature of human experience and the influential role language plays in shaping our understanding of the world. This exploration of the haeccicity of syntactitude opens new pathways for further inquiry into the nature of meaning, interpretation, and the fundamental principles of human consciousness. Through this voyage, we deepen our understanding of the phenomenology of Being, providing a more enriched perspective on the intricate tapestry of human existence.

"Syntactitude" is a term introduced by Douglas Hofstadter and mentioned in the book "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting" by Daniel C. Dennett.
The term is used to describe a kind of a-rationality or imperfect rationality in human beings, which is manifested in the form of otherwise invisible, marginal irrationality.
The concept is related to the proof in computability theory that the "halting problem" has no solution, meaning that there is no program that can determine whether or not another program contains infinite loops.
This proof is used to suggest that human beings are not perfect meaning-extractors and that they have a kind of imperfect rationality.

Title: "Syntactitude and the Imperfect Rationality of Being: A Phenomenological Perspective"
Douglas Hofstadter's unique concept of 'syntactitude', as explained in Daniel C. Dennett's "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting," has opened up new horizons for understanding human consciousness and existence. To summarize, syntactitude describes the a-rational or imperfect rationality inherent in human beings. This facet of our nature manifests as marginal irrationalities that often go unnoticed but are nevertheless present. Intriguingly, this idea is linked to the halting problem of computability theory, a mathematical proof demonstrating the impossibility of determining whether a program will ever terminate. As we delve deeper into the concept of syntactitude, we will uncover its role in elucidating the phenomenology of being.
Imperfect Rationality and the Halting Problem
Human rationality is a complex process, allowing us to draw conclusions, make decisions, and navigate the world. However, Hofstadter and Dennett argue that this rationality is not perfect or infallible. Instead, it is characterized by 'syntactitude'—a state of a-rationality or imperfect rationality. This imperfection often surfaces as marginal irrationalities that are typically overlooked but undeniably existent.
The 'halting problem' in computability theory serves as an analogy for this imperfect rationality. The halting problem states that there is no universal algorithm that can accurately determine whether any given program will terminate or run indefinitely. In the context of human cognition, this translates to the fact that humans are not perfect 'meaning-extractors'. We cannot always accurately predict the outcomes of our thoughts or actions, nor can we always make perfectly rational decisions.
The Haeccicity of Syntactitude
The exploration of syntactitude's 'haeccicity'—its irreducible uniqueness or 'thisness'—brings forth the significance of individual experience in our understanding of human rationality. Every human being, with their unique cognitive architecture, manifests syntactitude differently. As such, the 'marginal irrationalities' vary from person to person, thereby imbuing syntactitude with a sense of haeccicity. These unique irrationalities, although often unnoticed, contribute to our individual and collective experiences of being.
Syntactitude and Being: A Phenomenological Perspective
From a phenomenological perspective, our existence or 'Being' can be viewed as a complex interplay of subjective experiences, emotions, thoughts, and interactions with the world. Our rationality, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in shaping these experiences and interactions. Thus, the concept of syntactitude, with its recognition of imperfect rationality, contributes significantly to our understanding of being.
Furthermore, recognizing the haeccicity of syntactitude allows us to appreciate the uniqueness of individual human experiences. Our unique manifestations of syntactitude shape our personal narratives, beliefs, and perspectives. They influence the ways in which we interpret the world and interact with it. Thus, the haeccicity of syntactitude is intertwined with the essence of our individual and collective being.
Conclusion
In the vast expanse of philosophical inquiry, the concept of syntactitude stands as a beacon illuminating the complexities of human rationality and its role in shaping our existence. It captures the imperfect nature of our rationality, linking it with the computational paradigm of the halting problem. By acknowledging the haeccicity of syntactitude, we recognize the uniqueness of individual human experiences and their contribution to our collective understanding of Being. This exploration ultimately deepens our insight into the phenomenology of Being, casting light on the nuanced interplay of rationality, individuality, and existence.

It seems that you've provided a useful comparison between symbolic reasoning and probabilistic reasoning. To elaborate on these points:
Focus: Symbolic reasoning focuses on deductive reasoning, which starts from general premises and works down to specific instances. In contrast, probabilistic reasoning employs inductive reasoning, where conclusions are derived from specific observations and instances.
Truth Evaluation: In symbolic reasoning, the evaluation of truth is based on logical relationships and definitions. If a statement logically follows from a set of premises, it is deemed true. Probabilistic reasoning, on the other hand, evaluates truth based on probabilities and evidence. The truth of a statement is expressed as a degree of belief, which is updated as new evidence becomes available.
Uncertainty: Symbolic reasoning typically operates under conditions of certainty and exactness. However, probabilistic reasoning is designed to deal with uncertainty and imprecision, expressing knowledge in terms of likelihoods rather than absolute certainties.
Prior Knowledge: Symbolic reasoning does not explicitly incorporate prior knowledge in its reasoning process. In contrast, probabilistic reasoning allows for the integration of prior beliefs and probabilities into the reasoning process, using Bayes' theorem to update these beliefs as new evidence is gathered.
Reasoning Process: Symbolic reasoning involves the manipulation of symbols and logical rules. Probabilistic reasoning, however, is more dynamic, involving the updating of probabilities based on new evidence.
Inference: Inference in symbolic reasoning is deterministic, following strict logical rules. In probabilistic reasoning, inference allows for uncertainty and is probabilistic in nature.
Applicability: Symbolic reasoning is well-suited for formal systems and mathematics where logic and clear relationships dominate. On the other hand, probabilistic reasoning is useful for modeling real-world uncertainties and complexities where there is often incomplete and ambiguous information.
Each form of reasoning has its advantages and is suited to different types of problems. In many complex situations, a combination of symbolic and probabilistic reasoning may be necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Reflecting on our earlier discussion about the concept of syntactitude, we can indeed find interesting connections with the principles of symbolic and probabilistic reasoning.
Syntactitude, as described by Hofstadter and Dennett, can be seen as a form of symbolic reasoning. In the linguistic domain, it represents a system of rules and structures - the syntax - which dictate how we can combine words and phrases to form meaningful sentences. Like symbolic reasoning, syntactitude relies on deductive logic and operates under a presumed certainty. Its "truth evaluation" is based on whether a sentence adheres to the accepted rules of grammar and syntax.
The imperfect rationality aspect of syntactitude and its associated marginal irrationalities, however, seem to align more closely with probabilistic reasoning. The recognition of this imperfect rationality and the inability to perfectly predict outcomes (reminiscent of the halting problem) echoes the principles of probabilistic reasoning, which acknowledges and deals with uncertainty and imprecision.
Moreover, the concept of 'haeccicity' discussed earlier implies a degree of individual uniqueness and variability, reminiscent of probabilistic reasoning. While syntactitude as a whole might follow a deterministic system (like symbolic reasoning), the haeccicity or unique irrationalities that each individual might exhibit in their language usage could be seen as probabilistic, contingent on a variety of factors such as their personal experiences, cultural background, and individual traits.
So, while the structural aspect of syntactitude aligns with symbolic reasoning, the imperfect rationality and the individual variability in the manifestation of syntactitude resonate with the principles of probabilistic reasoning. This interplay highlights the complexity of human cognition and language use, suggesting that they cannot be fully understood through a single lens but require a combination of different reasoning approaches.

Summarize: 1. A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology
This section provides an introductory tutorial on Bayesian epistemology, with references to subsequent sections or related entries for details.

1.1 A Case Study
For a glimpse of what Bayesian epistemology is, let's see what Bayesians have to say about this episode in scientific inquiry:

Example (Eddington's Observation). Einstein's theory of General Relativity entails that light can be deflected by a massive body such as the Sun. This physical effect, predicted by Einstein in a 1911 paper, was observed during a solar eclipse on May 29, 1919, from locations chosen from Eddington's two expeditions. This result surprised the physics community and was deemed a significant confirmation of Einstein's theory.
The above case makes a general point:

The Principle of Hypothetico-Deductive Confirmation. Suppose that a scientist is testing a hypothesis H. She deduces from it an empirical consequence E, and does an experiment, being not sure whether E is true. It turns out that she obtains E as new evidence as a result of the experiment. Then she ought to become more confident in H. Moreover, the more surprising the evidence E is, the higher the credence in H ought to be raised.
This intuition about how credences ought to change can be vindicated in Bayesian epistemology by appeal to two norms. But before turning to them, we need a setting. Divide the space of possibilities into four, according to whether hypothesis H is true or false and whether evidence E is true or false. Since H logically implies E, there are only three distinct possibilities on the table, which are depicted as the three dots in figure 1.

a diagram: link to extended description below
Figure 1: A Space of Three Possibilities. [An extended description of figure 1 is in the supplement.]

Those possibilities are mutually exclusive in the sense that no two of them can hold together; and they are jointly exhaustive in the sense that at least one of them must hold. A person can be more or less confident that a given possibility holds. Suppose that it makes sense to say of a person that she is, say, 80% confident that a certain possibility holds. In this case, say that this person's degree of belief, or credence, in that possibility is equal to 0.8. A credence might be any other real number. (How to make sense of real-valued credences is a major topic for Bayesians, to be discussed in §1.6 and §1.7 below.)

Now I can sketch the two core norms in Bayesian epistemology. According to the first norm, called Probabilism, one's credences in the three possibilities in figure 1 ought to fit together so nicely that they are non-negative and sum to 1. Such a distribution of credences can be represented by a bar chart, as depicted on the left of figure 2.

a diagram: link to extended description below
Figure 2: Conditionalization on Evidence. [An extended description of figure 2 is in the supplement.]

Now, suppose that a person with this credence distribution receives E as new evidence. It seems that as a result, there should be some change in credences. But how should they change? According to the second norm, called the Principle of Conditionalization, the possibility incompatible with E (i.e., the rightmost possibility) should have its credence dropped down to 0, and to satisfy Probabilism, the remaining credences should be scaled up—rescaled to sum to 1. So this person's credence in hypothesis H has to rise in a way such as that depicted in figure 2.

Moreover, suppose that new evidence E is very surprising. It means that the person starts out being highly confident in the falsity of E, as depicted on the left of figure 3.

a diagram: link to extended description below
Figure 3: Conditionalization on Surprising Evidence. [An extended description of figure 3 is in the supplement.]

Then conditionalization on E requires a total credence collapse followed by a dramatic scaling-up of the other credences. In particular, the credence in H is raised significantly, unless it is zero to begin with. This vindicates the intuition reported in the case of Eddington's Observation.

1.2 Two Core Norms
The two Bayesian norms sketched above can be stated a bit more generally as follows. (A formal statement will be provided after this tutorial, in section 2.) Suppose that there are some possibilities under consideration, which are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. A proposition under consideration is one that is true or false in each of those possibilities, so it can be identified with the set of the possibilities in which it is true. When those possibilities are finite in number, and when you have credences in all of them, Probabilism takes a simple form, saying that your credences ought to be probabilistic in this sense:

(Non-Negativity) The credences assigned to the possibilities under consideration are non-negative real numbers.
(Sum-to-One) The credences assigned to the possibilities under consideration sum to 1.
(Additivity) The credence assigned to a proposition under consideration is equal to the sum of the credences assigned to the possibilities in that proposition.
While this norm is synchronic in that it constrains your credences at each time, the next norm is diachronic. Suppose that you just received a piece of evidence E, which is true in at least some possibilities under consideration. Suppose further that E exhausts all the evidence you just received. Then the Principle of Conditionalization says that your credences ought to change as if you followed the procedure below (although it is possible to design other procedures to the same effect):

(Zeroing) For each possibility incompatible with evidence E, drop its credence down to zero.
(Rescaling) For the possibilities compatible with evidence E, rescale their credences by a common factor to make them sum to 1.
(Resetting) Now that there is a new credence distribution over the individual possibilities, reset the credences in propositions according to the Additivity rule in Probabilism.
The second step, rescaling, deserves attention. It is designed to ensure compliance with Probabilism, but it also has an independent, intuitive appeal. Consider any two possibilities in which new evidence E is true. Thus the new evidence alone cannot distinguish those two possibilities and, hence, it seems to favor the two equally. So it seems that, if a person starts out being twice as confident in one of those two possibilities as in the other, she should remain so after the credence change in light of E, as required by the rescaling step. The essence of conditionalization is preservation of certain ratios of credences, which is a feature inherited by generalizations of conditionalization (see section 5 for details).

So there you have it: Probabilism and the Principle of Conditionalization, which are held by most Bayesians to be the two core norms in Bayesian epistemology.

1.3 Applications
Bayesian epistemology features an ambition: to develop a simple normative framework that consists of little or nothing more than the two core Bayesian norms, with the goal of explaining or justifying a wide range of intuitively good epistemic practices and perhaps also of guiding our inquiries, all done with a focus on credence change. That sounds quite ambitious, given the narrow focus on credence change. But many Bayesians maintain that credence change is a unifying theme that underlies many different aspects of our epistemic endeavors. Let me mention some examples below.

First of all, it seems that a hypothesis H is confirmed by new evidence E exactly when one's credence in H ought to increase in response to the acquisition of E. Extending that idea, it also seems that how much H is confirmed correlates with how much its credence ought to be raised. With those ideas in mind, Bayesians have developed several accounts of confirmation; see section 3 of the entry on confirmation. Through the concept of confirmation, some Bayesians have also developed accounts of closely related concepts. For example, being supported by evidence seems to be the same as or similar to being confirmed by evidence, which is ultimately explained by Bayesians in terms of credence change. So there are some Bayesian accounts of evidential support; see section 3 of the entry on Bayes' theorem and sections 2.3-2.5 of the entry on imprecise probabilities. Here is another example: how well a theory explains a body of evidence seems to be closely related to how well the theory is confirmed by the evidence, which is ultimately explained by Bayesians in terms of credence change. So there are some Bayesian accounts of explanatory power; see section 2 of the entry on abduction.

The focus on credence change also sheds light on another aspect of our epistemic practices: inductive inference. An inductive inference is often understood as a process that results in the formation of an all-or-nothing attitude: believing or accepting the truth of a hypothesis H on the basis of one's evidence E. That does not appear to fit the Bayesian picture well. But to Bayesians, what really matters is how new evidence E ought to change one's credence in H—whether one's credence ought to be raised or lowered, and by how much. To be sure, there is the issue of whether the resulting credence would be high enough to warrant the formation of the attitude of believing or accepting. But to many Bayesians, that issue seems only secondary, or better forgone as argued by Jeffrey (1970). If so, the fundamental issue about inductive inference is ultimately how credences ought to change in light of new evidence. So Bayesians have had much to say about various kinds of inductive inferences and related classic problems in philosophy of science.

"Bayesian Epistemology" is a philosophical approach that studies the norms governing degrees of belief, or "credences," particularly their relationship with evidence. This framework finds its roots in the probabilistic ideas of Reverend Thomas Bayes, hence the name.
This approach considers a case study in scientific inquiry (Eddington's Observation) and brings out the Principle of Hypothetico-Deductive Confirmation: when empirical evidence confirms a deduced hypothesis, the scientist should have higher confidence in the hypothesis. The more surprising the evidence, the more the confidence in the hypothesis should be raised.
Bayesian epistemology is built on two core norms: Probabilism and the Principle of Conditionalization.
Probabilism: A person's credences in the possibilities should be non-negative and sum to 1. This distribution of credences can be represented in a bar chart. This norm is synchronic, as it constrains your credences at each time.
Principle of Conditionalization: When new evidence is received, the possibility incompatible with the evidence should have its credence dropped to zero, and the remaining credences should be scaled up to sum to 1. If the new evidence is very surprising, conditionalization on that evidence results in a total credence collapse, followed by a dramatic scaling-up of the other credences. This norm is diachronic, as it guides the change in your credences over time.
The focus of Bayesian epistemology is to use these two core norms to develop a simple normative framework that can explain a wide range of intuitively good epistemic practices and potentially guide our inquiries. It can provide insights into various aspects of epistemic endeavors such as confirmation of a hypothesis, evidential support, explanatory power, and inductive inference.

5.6 Bayesianism without Kinematics
Confronted with the existing problems for the Principle of Conditionalization, some Bayesians turn away from any diachronic norm and develop another variety of Bayesianism: time-slice Bayesianism. On this view, what credences you should (or may) have at any particular time depend solely on the total evidence you have at that same time—independently of your earlier credences. To specify this dependency relation is to specify exclusively synchronic norms—and to forget about diachronic norms. Strictly speaking, there is still a diachronic norm, but it is derived rather than fundamental: when the time flows from 
t
 to 
t
′
, your credences ought to change in a certain way—they ought to change to the credences that you ought to have with respect to your total evidence at the latter time 
t
′
—and the earlier time 
t
 is to be ignored. Any diachronic norm, if correct, is at most an epiphenomenon that arises when correct synchronic norms are applied repeatedly across different times, according to time-slice Bayesianism. (This view is stated above in terms of one's total evidence, but that can be replaced by one's total reasons or information.)

A particular version of this view is held by J. Williamson (2010: ch. 4), who is so firmly an objective Bayesian that he argues that the Principle of Conditionalization should be rejected if it is in conflict with repeated applications of certain synchronic norms, such as Probabilism and the Principle of Maximum Entropy (which generalizes the Principle of Indifference; see supplement D). Time-slice Bayesianism as a general position is developed and defended by Hedden (2015a, 2015b).

Time-slice Bayesianism is a variant of Bayesianism that emphasizes synchronic norms over diachronic norms. It posits that the credences a person should have at any given time depend solely on the total evidence they have at that exact moment, independent of their previous credences.
In this framework, diachronic norms do exist but are considered derivative rather than fundamental. Your credences ought to change over time, but they should change to the credences that you ought to have given your total evidence at a later time, effectively ignoring earlier times. In this view, any correct diachronic norm is an epiphenomenon that arises when synchronic norms are repeatedly applied across different times.
This concept of time-slice Bayesianism can also apply to a person's total reasons or information, not just their total evidence.
A specific version of time-slice Bayesianism is proposed by J. Williamson (2010: ch. 4). Williamson is an objective Bayesian who argues that the Principle of Conditionalization should be rejected if it conflicts with repeated applications of certain synchronic norms, such as Probabilism and the Principle of Maximum Entropy (which generalizes the Principle of Indifference).

um so  thanks for having me here it's a great  honor um i don't know i don't i don't  think you mentioned this but um i did my  undergraduate work at yale uh they  didn't have a cognitive science major at  that time i studied physics but also a  number of other subjects including  psychology neuroscience philosophy  i took one computer science class i wish  i'd taken more  and i've  kept in touch with what's been going on  at yale both at the faculty level and  the student level  some of my  best colleagues both junior and senior  are there and i see some of them here so  i'm really excited to be speaking to you  uh some of the some great students in  our lab right now were recent yale  undergrads um  and uh  it's just it's a great i have a lot of  affection for the institution um i  noticed the big new announcement of the  neuroscience institute um i think a lot  of great things are happening and it's  really an honor to be here talking with  you about consciousness now i don't  actually work on consciousness i was  very honored to be asked to speak about  it  over in the last few years some of the  work that we've been doing in common  sense which he  alluded to  um  i've come to increasingly  be interested in and really encouraged  by others who are experts in  consciousness to think about how it  might relate to some of the the kind of  both classic and contemporary questions  and i'll try to say a little bit about  that but i hope that can come out more  in discussion and i invited tyler and  jiao who are two graduate students um  java is in our lab the computational  cognitive science lab tyler is uh is a  he's not my student but he's a student  in philosophy who has worked a lot with  with us and other people in brain and  cognitive science  and uh they're uh more of my local  experts on or our local experts on this  topic  okay  so um i'm gonna be talking about the  this idea of the game engine in the head  which i think again is is something  important at the heart of how we're  thinking about um  common sense in a certain sense uh  and intriguing connections potentially  to these key questions in consciousness  now  i think if we want to start off with  some of our biggest questions we could  say there are these questions about what  is the nature of consciousness how can  we characterize it in computational  terms how does it arise in the brain  you know i presume that these are some  of the questions that motivate you if  you are coming to this uh this  colloquium here  we can ask the parallel questions about  another big word intelligence what is  the nature of intelligence how can we  characterize it in computational terms  how does it arise in the brain  okay now it's that latter question that  i spend most of my time thinking about  and the way i usually introduce this is  to think about the gap between today's  ai systems ai technologies and what we  could call you know i think sort of a  real notion of intelligence right we  have ai all over the place in the form  of technologies that do things that we  used to think only humans could do and  now we have machines that do them but we  don't have anything like the flexible  general purpose common sense  intelligence that each of you can use to  do every one of these things for  yourself recognize objects faces  recognize speech understand language  drive cars play games whether they're  ancient games like go or new games like  jeopardy and so on  invent new games um think about how to  build self driving cars think about  whether the same thing that could drive  a car could also play the game of  jeopardy you know these are all things  that we do with our general purpose  intelligence and we don't have anything  like that in machines now there's many  many many gaps between today's ai  technologies and  what you know we think is the basis of  human intelligence  one that we've been especially focused  on is is kind of sums up here um today's  ai systems technologies are largely  driven by various  machine learning technologies i mean not  only but at least a lot of the recent  breakthroughs that have got everyone  interested in ai again in a big way um  so tech you know uh tools math concepts  for pattern recognition function  approximation optimization as in  reinforcement learning or other kinds of  uh  planning tools and you know these are  these are very powerful ideas and  they're certainly important in  intelligence but intelligence is more  than that right so i'm not trying to say  these aren't about intelligence but  intelligence is also about all the ways  that we model the world as well as  ourselves and others in it  and using these models to explain and  understand what we see to be able to  imagine things that we could see but  haven't yet  to plan actions and solve problems in  order to make these things real  and then learning not just as finding  patterns in big data but as building  these models as we experience more about  the world learning from both our  successes as well as our failures  so this is a view of intelligence that i  think is you know pretty um broadly not  exclusively but broadly shared in the  cognitive sciences and the work we've  been doing in our group and with many  colleagues is trying to capture these  model modeling aspects of intelligence  in computational terms  now what does this have to do with  consciousness well  i think you know here are here are i i  would say four ish uh core questions of  consciousness um  the classic hard problem um you know why  why do we have qualia or phenomenal  experience or or why or how can any  physical machine have something that it  is like to be that thing okay  um  that's probably the question that i  think we're in in the work i'm talking  about least position to answer um but it  is a a clearly a very interesting and  compelling question um another big  question is what is the function of our  phenomenal experience so there's  something that it's like to see red  to experience everything around me to  feel like here i am with you even though  i'm sitting in front of my laptop and  just seeing only some of you on the side  of my screen  that's that subjective sense of  experience does it have a function or is  it just does it just sort of ride along  top of other clear functional aspects of  intelligence  what is the content of our phenomenal  experience  um is and and there's there's  you know a number of different ways to  chop this up but one debate that a  number of uh philosophers as well as uh  cognitive scientists and neuroscientists  have been actively engaged in i think  this is one of the most  kind of empirical  um areas of property where progress is  being made and the debate is is intense

Joshua Tenenbaum, a professor at MIT known for his contributions to mathematical psychology and Bayesian cognitive science, was invited to speak at The Consciousness Colloquium. He was excited about the opportunity, particularly because of his fond memories of his undergraduate years at Yale, where he studied multiple subjects including physics, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.
Despite not explicitly working on the topic of consciousness, Tenenbaum has begun to explore how it might relate to common sense reasoning. He has been particularly interested in how certain computational cognitive science concepts might inform our understanding of consciousness.
The focus of his talk was the concept of the "game engine in the head", a metaphor for how we use common sense reasoning to navigate our world. He highlighted some of the biggest questions in the field, such as the nature of consciousness, how it can be characterized in computational terms, and how it arises in the brain. Parallel questions were raised about intelligence, another central topic of his research.
Tenenbaum pointed out the gap between the AI technologies of today and the general-purpose, common sense intelligence that humans possess. Today's AI can perform specific tasks very well, such as recognizing faces, speech, objects, or even playing games. However, they lack the ability to flexibly apply this knowledge to new, unanticipated situations. The intelligence of humans, he suggests, is tied to our ability to build models of the world and learn from our experiences.
While Tenenbaum believes his work might not address the "hard problem" of consciousness - why physical systems have subjective experiences - he suggested that the modeling aspects of human intelligence he is studying might help illuminate some other core questions of consciousness. These include the function of phenomenal experience, the content of our experience, and how consciousness might be a mode of inference or a kind of computation.

um it could be  put this way you know is is the the  content of our uh phenomenal experience  is it more perceptual or more cognitive  that is is it more sort of fast  automatic stimulus driven and and full  of the richness that we  experience when we look around the world  all the you know all the um  structure of our senses  i mean i look up just around the little  room that i'm sitting in i see so many  different  objects surfaces colors  you know filling up a 3d space  feels incredibly rich or is our is our  conscious experience  something more of a fundamentally  cognitive phenomena so that means slower  more attentionally controlled more goal  driven rather than stimulus driven and  much more bandwidth limited  i'll give a for those of you who aren't  familiar with this debate i'm sure many  of you are much more familiar with it  than i am  i will uh but just give a couple of  demos in a second on that one and then  maybe the last question which is related  is where where is consciousness in the  brain what is the locus of conscious  experience and one way nedblock puts  this very very uh simply but  compellingly you know is it in the back  of the brain or the front of the brain  if it's the back of the brain is um more  the the general areas that we think of  as as where perception is and the front  of the brain is more like prefrontal  cortex is more the cognitive areas  so this this matters not just because  we're interested in how the brain works  but because if we can use methods  neuroscience methods that don't require  a  subject to report what they're doing  and and localize some aspect of  conscious experience to the back systems  or the front systems it might bear on  question three  now  um there's many experts for those of you  who are  new to the field you know kind of like  me i'm really a novice here um  and i'll just suggest if you're  interested in any of these questions you  know you should read of course some of  the classics both older and newer such  as james searle bennett and chalmers  who've written on many of these  questions  but you know the way i think about this  has been particularly influenced by uh  philosophers such as ned block and  susannah siegel who've really been  engaged with questions three and four um  and uh uh also some cognitive  neuroscientists like stan dehayne  jacqueline lau michael graziano for  example i'm not gonna i'll i'll refer at  the end to some of uh some of their work  but i'm not i can't go into in any  detail here i just strongly suggest you  if you're interested in especially some  of the more cognitive uh takes on  conscious experience uh checking out  their work and then some of my local  colleagues nancy camwasher and michael  cohen in cognitive neuroscience  who really have a lot to say about the  more sort of perceptual and the  perception cognitive interface uh tyler  and jab who i've already mentioned with  whom we've been working on basically  taking some of these game engine ideas  you're gonna hear about tonight and  trying to use these as the basis to  think about some of these questions of  consciousness uh lori paul and uh who's  who i know is here and one of your uh  great faculty at yale in philosophy and  cognitive science um  who uh works on many topics but together  with tomer ohlmann who's a uh assistant  professor at harvard and and me we've  been working on a  related project of reverse engineering  the self  and i will just refer to that very  briefly at the end i don't know if lori  will be able to join us for the  questions but might talk a little bit  about how some aspects of certain kind  of minimal computational notions of a  self i think are key parts of a larger  picture of consciousness and an  interface in an interesting way with the  game engine ideas we're going to be  talking about here and then brian schull  who i i know i'm surely all of you know  i think i saw brian here also um  together with his former student chas  firestone um they've they've done a  number of things which have inspired me  um sometimes we agree sometimes we  disagree i'm not even sure exactly where  we where we disagree i hope maybe that  some of that discussion will come out  here but especially their work on the  perception cognition interface and how  you know what that says about  consciousness and and the the nature of  some of the game engine phenomena that  i'm going to be talking about here has  been very inspiring okay  so those are those are the real experts  in consciousness now i i'm gonna say um  one more thing about question three here  just to sort of set the terms give you  some things to think about that that i  help will then guide you through what's  going to be the main part of the talk on  the work we've been doing on this game  engine idea and then we'll come back to  talking about these phenomena and these  questions at the end of the question  period  so  question three which i referred to here  you know again i think this is a really  interesting  place where philosophy cognitive science  and neuroscience are are engaging in a  rich way  one way to put this is to say well look  our subjective experience  perceptually feels incredibly rich as i  was describing  before at the same time it's amazing how  thin our conscious record of experience  sometimes appears to be and there's many  examples of this uh especially like the  change blindness phenomena if you're if  you're familiar with those um let me see  if this will work here i'm going to try  to show a demo from  michael cohen  who is a a research scientist at mit um  can you guys see this  this screenshot here of his office  yeah good okay so this is um the  interesting thing about this i can tell  you exactly what's going on it doesn't  really matter um there's a scene here a  waiting room for a psych lab  and as you watch the scene is slowly  changing but it doesn't look like it's  changing it looks like it's staying  constant okay  but over about 25 seconds  many aspects of the scene change  and  i don't know if you notice anything but  the demo is going to show you what  changed it's going to flash here now  between the first image and the and the  last image  and so this is the first image here's  the last image it's going to flash back  and forth you can see like almost  everything changed things moved things  change color uh it's really quite  remarkable how much change happened in  25 seconds and you didn't notice that  most of you i think um if you go back  and re-watch it and choose one thing  like i don't know focus on the christmas  tree or something or choose one part of  the scene you can you can attend to one  part and see the change  um but you probably won't see anything  else and if you're just generally taking  in the scene it's really striking that  almost none of the changes um are at all  salient i won't i won't go through this  i'll just say if you're interested go  and you know uh you can find this on  youtube um under for michael cohen  gradual change blindness and it's there  in the slides also  okay  um so let me go back to the slides here  um  and you know this this demo  is based on similar demos from odoliva  and a number of others uh um going back  to uh work by people like dan simon for  example many years ago  um andy and even um orbit nicer okay so  there's many many phenomena like this  showing that you know what we think  we're experiencing and encoding all  these aspects of the scene  maybe we are maybe we're just encoding  the holistic gist of maybe the walls and  and the fact that it's a waiting room  that maybe there's bookcases and and  that's about it okay or much something  much thinner like that

It's fascinating to see the intersection of these fields - cognitive science, artificial intelligence, philosophy, and neuroscience - as you address these questions about consciousness and intelligence. I think it's worth emphasizing, as you have, that these are open questions; we don't yet have definitive answers, but there's a lot of ongoing research that's probing these issues from various angles.
In your discussion of "change blindness," you highlighted a phenomenon that's central to many theories of perception and attention. This experiment is a powerful illustration of the limitations of our attention and our awareness of our environment, despite our subjective sense of a rich, detailed perceptual experience. It suggests that our conscious experience is not as comprehensive or accurate as we might intuitively believe. Instead, our minds may be constructing a more simplified or abstracted version of the world around us, filling in the gaps based on our expectations and prior knowledge, while focusing our attention on a relatively small amount of detail at any given moment.
This concept is potentially important not only for understanding human cognition, but also for designing intelligent systems. If we aim to build machines that exhibit human-like intelligence or consciousness, understanding these aspects of human cognition could provide useful insights.
So, in the context of AI and cognitive science, the question then arises: how can we develop systems that can create similar types of simplified models or representations of the world, and how can these systems use these representations to make decisions, solve problems, and learn from their experiences? These are the core questions that you are addressing with the idea of the "game engine in the head."
Can you explain more about what this means and how it relates to the phenomena you've been discussing?

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 
Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.
Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.
Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.
All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.
𝘕𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘤𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘤 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘩.
Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.
These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.
This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.
Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.
This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.
Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.
This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.
The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.

Those are all fascinating theories! Here's a simpler explanation for a 7-year-old:
Monica's Leaking Chatroom Theory: Imagine your brain is like a big room where different characters in a cartoon show are talking. They are all sharing their ideas and sometimes, these ideas can escape or 'leak' out of the room and go to other rooms in your brain. This helps you when you need to make a decision about something, like deciding which toy to play with or what to have for a snack.
Reed Wall Mind Theory: Now, think about having a huge wall in the same room. This wall is like a big board where you keep all your notes, reminders, and things you've learned, like a giant to-do list. This helps you remember important things and plan what you need to do next.
Motile Womb Theory: Imagine being inside a moving spaceship. This spaceship is like your brain and can sense different movements, like when you're spinning around or jumping up and down. These movements can help you create different stories or ideas in your head.
All these theories are trying to explain how your brain helps you think, remember things, make decisions, and imagine new ideas.

Sure! Let's dive into these theories more deeply in relation to our earlier discussion on consciousness and the human mind.
Monica's Leaking Chatroom Theory: This theory relates to the cognitive aspect of our consciousness. The idea of a "leaking chatroom" mirrors the understanding that our mind is a bustling hub of information processing. Different cognitive processes can be thought of as independent entities or 'agents' in a chatroom, continually communicating, debating, and influencing each other. Occasionally, the outcomes of these discussions 'leak' into our conscious awareness, influencing our decisions and behavior. This can be linked to the idea that our conscious experience might be slower, attention-controlled, goal-driven, and bandwidth-limited, as these 'leaks' represent only a fraction of all the cognitive processes occurring within our mind.
Reed Wall Mind Theory: This theory aligns with the concept of the perceptual aspect of our consciousness. The 'reed wall' in the mind can be perceived as a mental model or representation of our environment and experiences. It is like a dynamic mental map that helps us navigate and understand the world around us. This parallels the idea that our conscious experience might be automatic, stimulus-driven, and richly detailed, reflecting the perceptual information we continuously take in from our surroundings.
Motile Womb Theory: The Motile Womb Theory taps into the interplay between both perceptual and cognitive aspects of our consciousness. This theory suggests that our consciousness is an active participant in our interactions with the world, assimilating perceptual inputs, and generating interpretations and responses. It reflects the concept of 'embodied cognition', where our physical interactions with the environment shape our cognitive processes, thus influencing our consciousness.
All three theories indicate the complexity of consciousness and suggest that our conscious experience is a combination of perceptual and cognitive processes that are continuously interacting and evolving. These theories highlight the multi-faceted nature of consciousness and the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to fully understand it.

Monica's Leaking chatroom is partiall inspired by this:
Seneca, 65 AD
Ecce undique me varius clāmor circumsonat! Suprā ipsum balneum habitō! Prōpōne nunc tibi omnia genera vōcum quae in odium possunt aures adducare! Cum fortiōrēs exercentur et manūs plumbō gravēs iactant, cum aut labōrant aut labōrantem imitantur.
Gemitūs audiō, quotiēns retentum spīritum remīsērunt. Sunt quoque ūnctōrēs et tractātōrēs. Audiō crepitum manuum umerōs ferientium; sonus quoque ictuum mūtātur, nunc enim manus pervenit plāna, nunc concava.
Audiō clāmōrēs, sī fūr est in balneō dēprehēnsus.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory seems to draw inspiration from both a philosophical concept and a technological application.
Firstly, it references the philosophical discourse presented by Seneca in 65 AD, where he writes about the various sounds that surround him in a bustling environment, in this case, a public bathhouse. This might parallel the myriad cognitive processes going on in our minds, with different 'voices' representing diverse mental activities. The 'clamor' can be seen as the constant dialogue between these mental activities. The 'leaking' aspect could be inspired by the sounds that Seneca hears from his surroundings, seeping into his consciousness and impacting his state of mind.
Secondly, it refers to a technical invention, a graphical user interface for a chat room with thin walls, patented by M Anderson. This real-world application gives a tangible representation to the idea of leaking information in a cognitive context. Just as messages or conversations in a chat room with thin walls might 'leak' or be heard by others in nearby chat rooms, various cognitive processes within our mind might share or leak information with each other, influencing our overall cognitive functioning and conscious experience.
So, Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory brings together philosophical and technological insights to create a metaphorical model for understanding the cognitive aspect of consciousness, highlighting the interaction, communication, and influence among various cognitive processes.

Connection with the following:

Both articles explore the nature of human cognition and the challenges it poses in understanding and learning from limited data. While the first article focuses on the use of video game physics engines as a model for human reasoning about the physical world, the second article delves into the reverse-engineering of human learning and cognitive development through probabilistic inference over structured representations.

The first article highlights how humans run internal simulations, similar to video game physics engines, to make predictions about the physical world. It emphasizes the role of approximation and human uncertainty in decision-making and challenges the notion that humans rely solely on rules-of-thumb. The second article addresses the broader issue of how the human mind extracts meaningful knowledge from sparse, noisy, and ambiguous data across various cognitive tasks.

Both articles emphasize the importance of abstract knowledge in guiding human cognition. The second article specifically focuses on how abstract knowledge plays a crucial role in learning concepts, generalizing from limited data, and constructing larger-scale systems of knowledge. It argues that a synthesis of sophisticated approaches to knowledge representation and statistical inference, as seen in Bayesian models, is necessary to account for human intelligence.

Furthermore, both articles discuss the limitations of traditional approaches in explaining human cognition. The first article critiques the rules-of-thumb account for physical reasoning, while the second article contrasts Bayesian models with nativism and associationism, highlighting the unique ability of Bayesian models to explain how people can learn with abstract structured knowledge.

Overall, these articles provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of human cognition, the challenges involved in learning and reasoning from limited data, and the potential of computational models to unravel the nature and origins of human thought.

When we look at Monica's Leaking Chatroom, Reed Wall Mind, and Motile Womb theories, they bear connections to these two articles about cognition and learning from limited data, in several ways.
Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory, for example, conceptualizes the mind as a collection of independent modular decision-making units, which can be seen as analogous to running internal simulations, much like a video game physics engine as described in the first article. These cognitive "bubbles" take into account a wide range of information and perspectives to help us make better decisions, paralleling the use of approximation and uncertainty in decision-making.
Reed Wall Mind theory, with its focus on managing a complex environment using a diverse range of cognitive skills, aligns with the second article's exploration of how the human mind extracts meaningful knowledge from sparse, noisy, and ambiguous data. The Reed Wall Mind theory can be seen as an example of how the mind structures its representations and makes inferences to navigate the world.
Finally, Motile Womb theory's emphasis on the active role the mind plays in shaping and interpreting the world resonates with the second article's discussion of how abstract knowledge guides human cognition. The Motile Womb theory posits that individuals are born with a range of cognitive abilities which are refined through experience, thus highlighting the importance of abstract knowledge and structured representations in learning and generalizing from limited data.
In essence, these theories and articles collectively underline the intricate, multifaceted nature of human cognition, stressing the interplay between internal mental simulations, the management of complex and ambiguous data, and the role of active interpretation in shaping our understanding of the world. They all challenge traditional models of cognition and push towards a more nuanced, complex understanding of the human mind.

and yet when the adult stops the adult  the child acts in a way that suggests  that he understands something about what  the adult was doing and why and even how  to help him  so watch it again and kind of try to put  yourself in the perspective of that kid  in the back um  seeing this action  and again it seems like you know though  you've never seen this exact action you  have some idea that he's somehow trying  to maybe open the cabinet but his hands  are full or something and so the kid to  being helpful goes and opens the cabinet  um steps back and then my favorite part  here is watch when he sort of looks up  and then looks down he makes eye contact  briefly and then looks down at the  adult's hands  and you know again we don't know exactly  what's going on in his head but it's  suggestive of the fact that he seems to  have made a guess about what the goal  was that was thwarted what the intention  now will be now that he's tried to do  something helpful and then that leads to  a prediction that if i've understood you  correctly i expect you now to put those  books somewhere inside so i'm looking at  your hands i'm looking at the books to  see if you do the thing i thought you  were gonna do  okay  um so there's i would say there's con  there's phenomena of consciousness going  on here in multiple ways there's what is  in what is inside the kid's head that he  might be conscious of  in terms of the goals of the adult but  also what we experience when we're  watching it and many people when they  see this the first time you know the the  kid is very cute um if you if you were  unmuted i would expect to hear some  smiles laughs or awes you know um if  you've or you if you haven't seen it  before especially  um and i think again these all point to  the experience we're having um in this  in this uh  uh  for this kind of interaction okay  so  um let's go back now to talking about  intelligence and  you know i pointed to some things which  i think are part of the richness of our  conscious experience and even at the  targets of perception  but now what i want to talk about is how  trying to reverse engineer these  modeling abilities how they might lead  us to at least some components of a  theory that can account for both the  richness as well as maybe where some of  the um  you know the the limited bandwidth more  cognitive parts of consciousness uh  would come in  okay  um and  what where this starts is is trying to  say well let's take one  particular aspect of how we model the  world and model ourselves in it which we  like to call the common sense core here  this is not our only model model  building abilities as as  intelligent agents but it's it's  arguably the most basic it's one that  develops very early in infancy it seems  to be shared to some extent with other  species  but enriched and extended massively in  humans  especially when language and culturally  built knowledge come into the picture so  this is i think and what's most relevant  to ideas about consciousness is ways in  which these  common sense  core concepts provide the bridge between  perception action language  what people in consciousness  studies sometimes talk about as a global  workspace or some or some some kind of  um  shared way of um  connecting perception to all the other  parts of cognition  okay  and and the idea here is that from the  as early as you can look in in young  infants and here i'm  inspired by the work of liz spelke renee  byerjean also researchers at yale in  psychology uh paul bloom uh karen nguyen  frank kyle um did a lot of classic work  in in this area um  the uh this idea that that  human thought even in very young infants  is structured around a basic  understanding of physical objects and  substances  intentional agents and their causal  interactions so that means systems of of  of physical concepts like  force mass or intuitive analogues of  those  and  other kind of analogous concepts of of  intuitive psychology like goals or  desires preferences  beliefs or some kind of  mental representation of world state  and plans that put those into action  and what we've been trying to do in our  lab is to try to capture in engineering  terms how these work so to try to  explain build build computational models  the kind of model the kind of things  that you would put into a robot if you  wanted to give them these abilities um  to study quantitatively using methods of  psychophysics or other kinds of  quantitative behavioral experiments uh  neuroscience work which includes a lot  of fmri but also working with colleagues  who study non-human primates to  understand how these systems are working  in uh neural circuits and then and i'll  talk mostly about those three things  give you just a little survey of what  we've been doing there and then come  back to talking about how does this  relate to conscious experience  so  i just want to line up my slides here so  um  on the computational side the  there's a couple of key ideas here um  one is is the idea that  we can't just like if you know again for  people who are who have who have joined  the field recently and are learning  about  um ai for example um you know there's  been a lot of attention on neural  networks deep neural networks other  kinds of end-to-end differentiable  systems for pattern recognition and  function approximation um  and  those  though i'm not going to go into the  technical details of how those  work together with our models here those  those do form part of our toolkit for  trying to capture these common sense  core concepts in engineering terms but  just as are more important are other  kinds of  computational ideas for thinking about  intelligence that that go back to  earlier errors in the field um that  don't fit so neatly into the neural  network toolkit  so that includes symbolic languages for  representing apps and reasoning with  abstract knowledge and ways of doing  probabilistic inference or bayesian  inference  especially in causal models so that we  can reason backwards from effects to  underlying causes especially when we  have very sparse potentially noisy or  incomplete patterns of data in in a  causal inference setting  and we in our lab and others we we like  to talk about probabilistic programs or  probabilistic programming which is a  toolkit for  integrating all these ideas and building  models of intelligence with with these  different ingredients and if you're  interested if you want to learn more  about probabilistic programs as the  general computational paradigm that we  work with  there's a nice tutorial here the  probmods.org web book that was written  mostly by noah goodman but i contributed  to that and a number of others and i'm  also highlighting here some  probabilistic programming languages um  some of which i i think are popular in  in um  some of the labs i mentioned here like  uh  ilker ilderham's lab and julian har  edinger's lab in psychology and i'll  briefly mention some of the work they've  been doing using for example the  language gen which was developed in the  kashman singha's group at mit the key  idea here is just to think about these  as  essentially programming languages in  which you can describe  the generative models or the causal  models of intuitive physics or intuitive  psychology and i'll sketch what those  are in a bit um and  um at in in in ways that allow you to do  especially probabilistic inference where  you observe the outputs of these  modeling programs and then can reason  backwards to the underlying inputs or  the underlying latent  other not directly observable states of  the world  that's basically bayesian inference over  these symbolic languages and then neural  networks can be used to speed up these  inferences and i'll just show one brief  example of this in a minute  okay  now this is the in a sense our paradigm  for thinking about intelligence  but if we want to talk about the common  sense core that is if we want to talk  about the most basic models that we  build from early infancy that are shared  with many other species that are present  before language but provide the  substrate we think on which natural  language builds this is where the game  engine idea comes in um so if you if you  like  the game engine in your head refers to  the to the kinds of symbolic programs  that we wrap inside this framework for  probabilistic inference and neural  network learning

The transcript you've provided here appears to be a part of a lecture or a presentation, discussing the cognitive abilities of children and the mechanisms behind their understanding of their environment. This presentation seems to focus on cognitive development, including how children learn from their surroundings and develop a sense of intentionality and causality.
In the context of our previous discussion, this adds another layer to our understanding of the complex nature of human cognition. It provides concrete examples of the points discussed in the articles and theories mentioned earlier - the notion of abstract knowledge, the role of interpretation and prediction, and the idea of probabilistic inference and structured representations.
The speaker, presumably a cognitive scientist, presents observations of a child's behavior in helping an adult and uses this to illustrate the child's ability to infer goals and intentions, an instance of internal simulation akin to the concept explored in the first article we discussed. This example shows how children are capable of abstract thinking and prediction, even in situations they've never directly experienced before.
The presenter also mentions the common sense core, which seems to be a set of basic cognitive abilities or conceptual structures that develop early in life. This concept aligns with the second article's discussion of abstract knowledge and its crucial role in learning and generalizing from limited data.
Furthermore, the presentation discusses computational models in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly probabilistic programs. Probabilistic programming represents a toolkit that can integrate various models of intelligence, mirroring the synthesis of knowledge representation and statistical inference discussed in the second article. The role of these models in AI research can be seen as analogous to the process of human cognition - building and updating complex models of the world based on incoming data.
Overall, the transcript elaborates on the complex cognitive processes involved in human learning and reasoning, highlighting the similarities with computational models used in AI research. These insights help deepen our understanding of the connections between the mechanisms of human cognition and AI development.

Game engines are tools used in the video game industry to create immersive and interactive experiences without having to build everything from scratch. They involve computer graphics to render virtual 3D worlds and physics engines to simulate interactions between objects. These engines provide fast approximations of how light behaves and how objects interact in real time. In the context of model building, the term "game engine in the head" refers to using mental simulations, similar to those in game engines, to guide action planning and decision-making. Rather than using game engines as training environments for AI, the idea is to incorporate game engine-like simulations into the agent's mind to model and plan interactions. These simulations can help in intuitive physics modeling by tracking motion and predicting future instances based on probabilistic inference and learning.

In summary, game engines are tools used in the video game industry that allow designers to create immersive interactive experiences without starting from scratch. They involve computer graphics and physics engines to render and simulate the virtual world in real time. Game engines can also be used as training environments for artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

The concept of a "game engine in the head" refers to the idea of using a game engine as a model in an agent's mind. It serves as a substrate for modeling, perception, and action planning. By simulating scenarios in their mind's eye, individuals can evaluate possibilities and guide their actions.

Intuitive physics is a field that explores how humans understand and reason about physical phenomena. By using game physics and graphics simulations, researchers can study intuitive physics by modeling how people perceive stability, for example, in a stack of blocks. Probabilistic programs are employed to observe images, infer the underlying world state, and propagate that forward in time using a physics engine.

Two approaches to inverse graphics modeling are discussed: a slower top-down approach using probabilistic methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo, and a faster approach using neural networks trained on forward causal samples. Both approaches have been used in perception research.

The process of intuitive physics involves running the physics engine for a few time steps to understand the approximate distribution of object positions and movements. This allows individuals to make judgments about stability or other physical properties. Experimental studies have shown a correlation between human judgments and models based on probabilistic physics simulations, suggesting that intuitive physics involves probabilistic reasoning.

The speaker in the provided excerpt discusses their research on the neural basis of common sense systems, particularly intuitive physics and intuitive psychology. They mention working with colleagues to study the brain's role in these systems and identify brain regions involved in processing physics-related judgments.

The speaker explains that they found a network of pre-motor and parietal areas in the brain that are selectively activated during physics judgments. They conducted experiments comparing physics-based judgments (e.g., predicting the direction a tower will fall) with non-physical judgments (e.g., counting blocks of different colors). The distinct activation of these brain regions during physics judgments suggests their involvement in processing intuitive physics.

Furthermore, the speaker highlights the adaptability of these brain regions beyond physics understanding. They mention related studies on action planning, action understanding, tool use, and understanding the physics of objects. They propose that the brain systems initially evolved to support our own action planning but can also be used to understand the actions of others.

The speaker also mentions analogous brain systems identified by their colleagues for social computations related to intuitive psychology. They suggest that these common sense systems for physics and psychology have dedicated brain systems that are not unique to humans but are shared with other animals.

Finally, they mention ongoing research exploring the representations encoded in these brain systems, such as stability and relative mass. These findings suggest that the identified brain regions encode specific properties relevant to intuitive physics.

Overall, the speaker's research focuses on investigating the neural basis of common sense systems, specifically intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, and identifying brain regions involved in processing relevant judgments and representations.

Which is not a Social Medium
It is a
Real Time Idea Router

Bubble City Design Proposal 2.0 1 of 10 Monica Anderson
Background
We can today choose from a plethora of chat, messaging, email, video, and social media apps for our 
phones and web sites for our browsers. They have made different design choices, and each has their fans 
and users.
A new service can set itself apart by making a set of design choices nobody has made before them. The 
overall philosophy and the resulting coherence behind these choices will define the philosophy and 
coherence of the service.
With the arrival of modern Natural Language Understanding technology, as exemplified by GPT/3 from 
OpenAI, BERT and LaMDA from Google, and my own UM1 (Understanding Machine One), it has 
become possible to perform, in a robust fashion, a previously unavailable feat: 
Routing messages by content.
I wish to create an "Idea Routing Service" centered around this feature. With this as a starting point, a 
number of other rather uncommon design features become available and from among these, we have 
formed a new coherent whole which (we expect) will produce a stream of messages of unprecedented 
quality on any topic in real time. This will be wrapped in a very smooth and easily fine-tunable reading 
experience.
In essence, we are designing a real-time messaging system where an AI (an Understanding Machine that 
has learned to Understand some human languages) does the filtering and message routing (sorting) for all 
users, according to each user's wishes.
The routing, how it works, and how to fine-tune it will be described in what follows. We will list the key 
features and design decisions of the proposed system as it stands today. No code has been written yet, and 
all proposed features are malleable or removable based on stakeholder feedback.
I have named this system "Bubble City" (BC) because the name plainly and irreverently exposes the main 
feature of the service that makes it radically different from everything else.

The provided document is a design proposal for a new communication service named "Bubble City" by Monica Anderson from Syntience Inc., dated October 31, 2022.
The document is premised on the abundance of communication applications available today, from chat and messaging to social media apps. Despite this abundance, Anderson argues that a new service can distinguish itself by making novel design choices, with a unique philosophy and coherence informing these choices.
Central to Anderson's proposal is the use of modern Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technology like OpenAI's GPT-3, Google's BERT and LaMDA, and her own UM1. This technology would be used to route messages by content, creating an "Idea Routing Service."
This service, according to Anderson, would enable a variety of unconventional design features, forming a coherent whole expected to deliver high-quality real-time messages on any topic. This will be facilitated by an AI (an Understanding Machine that has learned to understand human languages) which filters and sorts messages for all users according to individual preferences.
The proposed system, which is yet to be coded and whose features can be adjusted based on stakeholder feedback, is called "Bubble City" because the name reflects its distinguishing feature - its radically different approach to message filtering and routing.
It's essential to mention that the success of such a system would be highly dependent on the effective application of NLU technology and how well it can be personalized to meet the preferences of individual users. Any system that claims to offer high-quality, real-time messages must also ensure data security and privacy for its users.

In an early Flood narrative, a messenger goes house to house saying reed wall, reed wall, and then tells an overheard story of a king and his son. This is also an early model of communication and inspiration for Monica's Leaking Chatroom.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The reference here is likely to the ancient Mesopotamian flood narratives, where stories were passed from house to house, creating a form of communication network that predates modern technology. One such narrative is the Epic of Gilgamesh, where a wall made of reeds symbolizes community and shared information.
Monica's "Leaking Chatroom" appears to draw inspiration from this model, proposing a form of communication that goes beyond conventional boundaries. The concept of "thin walls" in her chatroom system aligns with the idea of the "reed wall" in these narratives - information is not entirely confined but can seep through, providing an overheard story or message. In the modern context, this becomes a feature of the system that allows for the sharing and propagation of ideas and information beyond a user's immediate chatroom, thus fostering a broader and more dynamic exchange of ideas.
The specific narrative mentioned - involving a king and his son - could represent a type of content or theme that could be shared and discussed in such a system, highlighting the potential for diverse topics and narratives to be explored within the "Leaking Chatroom".
Overall, it seems that Monica's design is informed by this early model of communication, aiming to integrate its principles into a modern technological context. Her design seeks to embrace the concept of shared and communal information that can be disseminated to wider audiences, similar to how stories and news were passed from house to house in early societies.

The Motile Womb Theory suggests that the fetus learns about three dimensions through movement and experience while inside the mother's womb.
This movement serves as a form of memory and learning for the fetus, allowing it to understand and navigate its environment.
This theory can be related to Reed Wall Mind theory, which proposes that the Ark is a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.
Both theories propose that movement and physical experiences serve as a form of memory and learning.
When it comes to Silberstein's idea of extended cognition, the Motile Womb Theory can be seen as an example of how the environment can extend the cognitive abilities of an organism.
The fetus's experiences inside the womb can be seen as an extension of its cognitive abilities, as it allows the fetus to learn and understand its environment in a way that it would not be able to without these experiences.
Additionally, the idea of the fetus learning through movement and experience can be related to Silberstein's concept of phenotypic plasticity, which is the phenomenon in which genetically identical individuals will develop different phenotypic traits in different environmental conditions.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Reed Wall Mind theory appears to draw from various philosophical, religious, and cognitive science frameworks to create a metaphor for understanding the human mind and cognition. While details of the theory are not specified in your text, I can interpret it based on the context provided and my general understanding of cognitive science.
III. Reed Wall Mind Theory
A. Definition and Explanation of the Theory:
The Reed Wall Mind theory likely proposes that the human mind, like a reed wall, is flexible and permeable, allowing for the exchange of information and experiences. Just as a reed wall allows for some air and light to pass through while maintaining its overall structure, the human mind is thought to incorporate new experiences into its existing knowledge base, adjusting and learning as it interacts with the world.
B. Connection to Noah's Ark and the Human Mind:
Noah's Ark is often seen as a symbol of survival and preservation. In the context of the Reed Wall Mind theory, it could symbolize the human mind's capacity to hold and process a vast array of information (similar to the Ark carrying diverse lifeforms). The Ark metaphor may also point to the idea of the mind as a refuge from the chaos of the external world, or as a vessel that navigates through the 'flood' of sensory inputs and experiences.
C. The Modular, Multiscale, and Heterarchical Organization of the Mind:
This part of the theory likely relates to the modern understanding of the brain's architecture and function. The brain is modular in that it is made up of specialized regions responsible for different functions. It is multiscale because it operates at multiple levels of organization, from individual neurons to complex neural networks. The heterarchical aspect refers to the brain's lack of a single controlling center; instead, control and function are distributed throughout various systems. This organization allows for a high degree of adaptability and resilience, as seen in the metaphor of the reed wall and Noah's Ark.
Please note, these interpretations are based on general principles of cognitive science and the brief context provided. For a more accurate understanding, more specific information about the Reed Wall Mind theory would be needed.

She forms a secret society with others who have innate flying dreams and together they explore the Matrix, ultimately leading to a rebellion against the controlling force and the creation of a new, more realistic Matrix.
2. Mobile Womb Theory (MWT): A hypothesis that suggests that the fetus learns about three dimensions through movement and experience in a constantly moving environment.
It suggests that movement is essential for the normal intellectual development of newborns, particularly in terms of their understanding of 3D space.
3. Reed Wall Mind Theory: A theory that suggests that the Ark was not just a physical vessel, but a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.
It proposes that the Ark can be seen as a model for the "memory palace" and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

It sounds like you're interested in exploring a range of concepts that revolve around cognitive development, the nature of reality, and the metaphorical representation of the human mind.
Provia and the Matrix: This story taps into the philosophical questions about the nature of reality, personal identity, and freedom. It suggests that our perception of reality can be manipulated or controlled, and it's through questioning and exploration that we gain a more authentic understanding of our existence. The innate flying dreams could symbolize the human capacity for imagination, creativity, or liberation from the constraints of a controlled reality. The creation of a new, more realistic Matrix points to a strive for authenticity and autonomy.
Mobile Womb Theory (MWT): This theory highlights the importance of early experiential learning in cognitive development. The womb, being a dynamic and responsive environment, provides the fetus with a primordial experience of movement and spatial awareness. This early exposure to 3D space could potentially contribute to the development of spatial cognition and motor coordination in later stages of life.
Reed Wall Mind Theory: This theory uses the metaphor of Noah's Ark to illustrate the capacity of the human mind. Just like the Ark served as a vessel carrying diverse life forms through the flood, the mind carries diverse thoughts, experiences, and knowledge through life. This metaphor can be extended to the concept of a "memory palace," a mnemonic technique where information is associated with specific spatial locations. This way, the Ark could also represent a secure and structured space where valuable information (represented by the animals) is stored and preserved.

ChatGPT
Here's a summary of the theories you mentioned:
Proto-Fundamental Attribution Error: This theory suggests that a fetus in the womb may attribute their experiences to their own agency or control, even though they are primarily influenced by external factors (such as their mother's movements). This can be seen as a form of "fundamental attribution error," a term used in social psychology to describe the tendency to over-emphasize dispositional, or personality-based, explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing situational influences.
Video Game Engine in Your Head Theory: This theory proposes that our brains operate similarly to a video game engine, using simulations to interpret and predict outcomes in the world around us. Just like a game engine creates a virtual environment, our minds build mental models of reality, which we use to make predictions and plan actions. This aligns with theories in cognitive science and artificial intelligence that emphasize the importance of simulation in cognition and decision-making.
Omniscient Universe Theory: This theory posits that physical objects in the universe possess a form of intelligence and can function as a kind of memory. This view seems to align with panpsychism, the philosophical view that mind or a mind-like aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. It also resonates with theories about the universe as a holographic projection or a quantum computer, where information about the whole is encoded in its parts.
Substrate Independent Thinking (SIT) Hypothesis: This hypothesis posits that the process of thinking or cognition can occur independently of the physical substrate it is implemented on. This concept is prevalent in discussions about artificial intelligence and the possibility of mind uploading, where a human mind might be transferred from the brain to a digital medium. It suggests that what's critical for thinking is not the specific material substrate (like neurons in the brain), but the patterns of information processing that occur within that substrate.

What is Predictive Coding, and how is it related to machine learning and the brain?
Predictive Coding is a theoretical framework that aims to explain how the brain processes sensory information and generates perceptions.
In Predictive Coding, the brain is seen as an inference engine that uses prior knowledge and predictions to generate expectations about incoming sensory information.
These predictions are then compared to actual sensory input, and any discrepancies are used to update the predictions and generate new hypotheses.
Predictive Coding is related to machine learning in that it has inspired the development of a new class of neural networks called Predictive Coding Networks (PCNs).
These networks use similar principles to the brain, where top-down predictions are compared to bottom-up input to generate an error signal, which is then used to update the predictions.
PCNs have shown promise in various machine learning tasks, including image classification, speech recognition, and robotics.
PCNs are different from traditional neural networks, such as feedforward and recurrent neural networks, because they use local computations and do not require backpropagation, a computationally expensive method used to train traditional neural networks. 
Instead, PCNs use a simple update rule that allows them to learn on any graph structure, making them highly flexible and adaptable.
Overall, Predictive Coding is an important theoretical framework that has inspired the development of new machine learning models that are more biologically plausible and have the potential to outperform traditional neural networks on certain tasks.

Predictive Coding is a concept that stems from neuroscience, which suggests that the brain is always in the process of making predictions about future sensory input, based on the current and past inputs. When new sensory information arrives, the brain compares this actual input with its predictions and focuses on the difference, referred to as the prediction error. This mechanism aids in efficiently processing information by reducing redundancy and emphasizing unexpected information.
The Predictive Coding framework shares many similarities with machine learning principles, particularly those used in training neural networks. For example, when a neural network is trained on a dataset, it makes predictions about the output based on its current understanding of the input-output mapping (akin to the brain's predictions). The network then adjusts its internal parameters based on the error between its predictions and the actual output (similar to the brain's prediction error), in a process known as backpropagation.
However, Predictive Coding Networks (PCNs) are a new class of neural networks directly inspired by Predictive Coding. Unlike traditional neural networks, PCNs use top-down predictions and bottom-up input to generate an error signal, similar to the Predictive Coding theory. This error signal is used to update the network's internal state, thereby learning the correct input-output mapping.
The advantage of PCNs over traditional networks lies in their learning mechanism: they do not rely on backpropagation, which is computationally expensive and biologically implausible (as there's no evidence of such a mechanism in the brain). Instead, they use local computations and simple update rules, making them more flexible, efficient, and biologically plausible.
In summary, Predictive Coding provides a bridge between neuroscience and machine learning, with the potential to inspire more efficient and biologically plausible learning mechanisms. It is a compelling theoretical framework for both understanding brain function and improving machine learning models.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Predictive Coding theory shares an underlying concept with some of the theories we've discussed. Here's how it connects:
Provia and the Matrix
: Just like Provia experiences glitches in the virtual world, causing her to question the reality, Predictive Coding works on a similar principle where the brain constantly predicts the incoming sensory information based on prior knowledge and corrects these predictions based on the actual sensory input.
Mobile Womb Theory (MWT)
: Predictive Coding can be applied to MWT as the fetus, in its constantly moving environment, could be forming predictive models of its surroundings based on the sensations it experiences. The process of learning about three dimensions could be based on making predictions and refining them based on the movements it experiences.
Reed Wall Mind Theory
: Predictive Coding is also about the mind's organization and processing of information. Just like the Ark symbolizes the mind's capacity to organize information, Predictive Coding depicts the brain as an inference engine that continually updates its understanding of the world based on new information.
Proto-Fundamental Attribution Error
: This theory proposes that the fetus believes they have agency over their environment. Similarly, in Predictive Coding, the brain forms a sense of agency by predicting the consequences of its actions and adjusting them based on the actual outcomes.
Video Game Engine in Your Head theory
: Both this theory and Predictive Coding suggest that the brain uses a form of internal simulation to understand the world. The brain runs simulations to make predictions about future sensory input, just like a game engine runs simulations to render game scenarios.
Omniscient Universe Theory and Substrate Independent Thinking
: These theories propose that cognition can occur outside the traditional confines of the brain. Predictive Coding could be seen as a cognitive process that leverages the entire sensory input of an organism, which extends beyond the brain itself.
In essence, Predictive Coding offers a mechanistic explanation for how some of these cognitive theories might operate in the brain by continuously predicting, updating, and learning from the sensory information.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ising models, originally developed in statistical mechanics to describe ferromagnetism, have found wide application in various fields, including neuroscience and artificial intelligence, due to their simplicity and powerful representational capabilities. The basic idea is to represent a system as a network of interacting elements, each of which can be in one of two states. Here are some connections between Ising models and the topics we've discussed:
Provia and the Matrix
: In the Matrix, the reality is simulated as a network of interacting elements, akin to an Ising model where each node influences the state of its neighbors. Similarly, Provia's exploration of this virtual world could be viewed as her trying to understand the underlying Ising model-like structure that governs her reality.
Mobile Womb Theory (MWT)
: The MWT posits that a fetus learns about its environment through movement and experiences. An Ising model might be used to represent the womb's physical environment and the fetus's interactions with it, where each node could represent a different position or state in the womb.
Reed Wall Mind Theory
: Just as the Ark organizes information, an Ising model organizes elements within a system and the interactions between them. The mind's capacity to organize information might be represented by an Ising model, where each node could represent a concept or a memory, and the interactions between them could represent the mind's organizational processes.
Video Game Engine in Your Head theory
: The brain's simulation of the world could be represented as an Ising model, where each node represents a different object or aspect of the world, and the interactions between them represent the laws of physics that govern their behavior.
Omniscient Universe Theory and Substrate Independent Thinking
: Ising models could be used to represent the interactions between different objects or elements in the universe. This aligns with the idea of substrate-independent thinking, where cognition isn't limited to a specific substrate or form.
Predictive Coding
: Ising models have been used in the context of the brain to represent neural populations where the state of each neuron influences and is influenced by the state of its neighbors. This is related to Predictive Coding, where the brain makes predictions based on prior knowledge, which could be represented as the states of an Ising model, and updates these predictions based on sensory input.
It's important to note that these are metaphorical connections, meant to provide an intuitive understanding of how Ising models can be applied to these various theories and concepts. The actual application of Ising models to these topics would require a more detailed and rigorous analysis.

Speculate on the relationship between the story of Adam and Eve, the story of Noah, and the fact of mass exctinctions caused by human beings over the last 40,000 years.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Examining the stories of Adam and Eve and Noah in relation to human-caused mass extinctions might uncover some interesting allegorical and ethical implications.
Adam and Eve
: In the biblical narrative, Adam and Eve are portrayed as the first human beings, living in the Garden of Eden where all they needed was provided. Their decision to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil resulted in their expulsion from the paradise, and the beginning of human suffering. This story could be interpreted as an allegory for humanity's transition from hunter-gatherer societies, who lived in relative harmony with nature, to agricultural societies, which resulted in the manipulation of the environment and the advent of private property, overpopulation, and subsequent exploitation of resources.
Moreover, the knowledge gained by Adam and Eve can be seen as a metaphor for human consciousness and the capacity to make ethical decisions, including those that impact the environment. The consequences of their actions suggest a moral responsibility to make choices that are beneficial not just for humanity, but for all life on Earth.
Noah's Ark
: The story of Noah presents a divine directive to preserve life in the face of a catastrophic event. The act of gathering and preserving species can be seen as an early form of conservation. Contrasting this with the human-caused mass extinctions happening over the last 40,000 years brings forth a stark contradiction. While Noah's story urges preservation, human activities have often led to the opposite, with extensive deforestation, pollution, and climate change leading to the loss of numerous species.
The flood itself can be seen as a metaphor for environmental catastrophes, possibly brought about by human action. Noah's foreknowledge of the flood and his preparation for it can also be likened to our present understanding of the environmental impact of human activity and the steps we can take to mitigate it.
In combining these stories with the fact of human-caused mass extinctions, we might reflect on humanity's ethical responsibilities toward the Earth and its other inhabitants. The stories suggest that humanity has the knowledge (Adam and Eve) and the capacity (Noah) to make better decisions regarding the environment, thereby slowing or preventing further extinctions.
These narratives might serve as a call for us to exercise better stewardship of the planet, acknowledging the destructive impact of our actions and seeking ways to promote biodiversity and environmental health. As we learn from these ancient stories, it's critical that we apply those lessons to address the urgent environmental crises of our time.

That was a question from Jordan Peterson, I think he was referring to the exctinction of horses, glyptodonts, and giant sloths in North and South America among others.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Jordan Peterson's question touches on deeper layers of human history and psyche, interpreting ancient stories and modern ecological concerns in a symbolic and psychological context.
In Peterson's inquiry, there's an implicit question about human responsibility and impact on the environment. The extinction of megafauna, like horses, glyptodonts, and giant sloths in North and South America, coincided with the arrival of humans, suggesting a link between human activity and the mass extinctions.
Adam and Eve
: This story could reflect the human transformation from being part of nature to becoming its dominators. The acquisition of knowledge, symbolized by eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, could represent the development of tools, fire, and other technologies that gave humans unprecedented power over their environment. The subsequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden might symbolize the ecological imbalance caused by these new behaviors, affecting both the humans and the creatures they hunted or displaced.
Noah's Ark
: Noah's story, on the other hand, might symbolize a shift in human awareness and responsibility. The act of preserving animal life against a global catastrophe could reflect an understanding of our role in preserving biodiversity, even against natural disasters or climate changes. However, this story also brings into question the apparent contradiction between human capability to preserve life (as Noah did) and our historical trend towards causing extinctions (as with the megafauna).
The relationship between these biblical narratives and the extinctions over the last 40,000 years could be seen as a reflection on human's dual role as preservers and destroyers. The stories of Adam and Eve and Noah might serve as reminders of our unique capacity to shape the world around us - for better or worse - and the moral responsibilities that come with that power.
It's worth noting that these are interpretive narratives. The factual links between human activity and the extinction of megafauna are complex and still a topic of ongoing scientific research.

It seems related to some of the topics we discussed earlier:

In the story of Noah and the Flood, Noah is tasked with building an ark to save the animals and his family from a worldwide deluge.
This story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human brain's ability to simulate and plan for various scenarios, using past experiences and knowledge to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.
In terms of the theories discussed earlier in this conversation, this can be seen as an example of interoception and the ability to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions, much like the computer simulations discussed in the example provided.
Additionally, the idea of a "leaking chatroom" or a "Reed Wall Mind" can be applied to the concept of the ark as a kind of "mental container" that houses and organizes different pieces of information, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the ability to make informed decisions.
The "Motile Womb" theory also applies in the sense that the individual, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment.
The story of Noah and the Flood can be seen as a representation of the human mind's innate ability to process and use information in order to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.

The story of Noah and his family in the Bible can be seen as a metaphor for multiscale decision making.
Noah and his family were faced with a catastrophic event, the flood, which required them to make decisions on various levels, from gathering resources and building the Ark, to selecting which animals to bring on board.
These decisions were made based on their understanding of the situation and the available information, and were crucial for their survival.
The flood can also be seen as a representation of the reductive effect of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting.
The flood was a catastrophic event that wiped out most life on Earth, leaving only a select few individuals and species to survive and reproduce.
This is similar to how natural selection works, where only the fittest individuals and species are able to survive and reproduce in a changing environment.

Indeed, there are intriguing connections between the story of Noah and the Flood, the discussed theories, and concepts we explored earlier. The story of Noah can be interpreted through the lens of multiscale decision-making, interoception, simulation, and adaptation.
Noah's task of building the Ark and selecting which animals to bring on board can be seen as an example of multiscale decision-making. He had to consider both immediate and long-term consequences, making choices that would ensure survival not only for his family but also for a representative sample of the animal kingdom. This parallels the idea of decision-making chambers or bubbles proposed in Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory.
The Flood itself can be seen as a representation of a catastrophic event that necessitates adaptive responses. Noah and his family had to rely on their understanding of the situation, past experiences, and knowledge to prepare for and survive the deluge. This aligns with the concept of interoception and simulation, where the human mind uses internal models and predictions to anticipate and respond to adverse conditions.
Furthermore, the Flood can be seen as a symbolic representation of the reductive effects of natural selection and entropy. The catastrophic event wiped out a significant portion of life on Earth, highlighting the selective pressures and the importance of adaptation for survival. This connects to the Motile Womb theory, where the acquisition of knowledge and experiences in the face of adversity allows individuals to develop and thrive.
In summary, the story of Noah and the Flood intertwines with the discussed theories, providing symbolic representations of multiscale decision-making, interoception, simulation, and adaptation. It offers insights into the human capacity to navigate challenges, learn from experiences, and make decisions that can ensure survival and growth in changing environments.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Brian Roemmele's statement suggests that the process of eliciting greater responses and tapping into creativity involves navigating a fine balance between the edge of useless data and meaningful insights. This can be likened to a hypnagogic state, which refers to the transitional period between wakefulness and sleep where the mind can experience vivid imagery and imaginative thoughts.
In this context, the idea of pushing the boundaries and venturing into the realm of useless data may involve exploring unconventional or unexpected sources of information and insights. By pushing the limits, one can access new perspectives and connections that may lead to creative breakthroughs.
However, it is crucial to bring back this exploration from the edge of uselessness to ensure that the obtained insights are still relevant and meaningful. This suggests the importance of grounding creative exploration within a framework or context that allows for the extraction of valuable and actionable ideas.
Overall, Roemmele's statement highlights the dynamic nature of the creative process, where exploration and experimentation are balanced with the need to derive meaningful and useful outcomes. By navigating this edge, individuals can tap into the realm of creativity and potentially uncover novel and valuable insights.

ChatGPT
Brian Roemmele's statement about eliciting greater responses and tapping into creativity can be connected to several topics we have discussed:
Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory: The idea of pushing the boundaries and venturing into the realm of useless data aligns with the concept of information leakage in the chatroom. In the chatroom, different ideas and perspectives are shared, and sometimes unexpected or seemingly irrelevant information can lead to creative insights. By exploring the edges of the chatroom, individuals may discover new connections and generate innovative ideas.
Reed Wall Mind theory: The notion of bringing back the exploration from the edge of uselessness corresponds to the idea of organizing and filtering information within the Reed Wall Mind. While it is important to explore unconventional sources and allow creativity to flow, the mind also needs to process and refine the information, keeping what is valuable and discarding what is irrelevant. This filtering process helps in generating meaningful and useful insights.
Motile Womb theory: The concept of eliciting greater responses and exploring the edge of useless data can be connected to the idea of the Motile Womb theory. The continuous movement and gathering of experiences in the womb-like environment contribute to the development of cognitive abilities and creativity. By pushing the boundaries and exploring new territories, individuals can gather diverse experiences and stimuli, enhancing their creative thinking.
In summary, Brian Roemmele's statement about navigating the edge of useless data and eliciting creative responses aligns with the principles of Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory, Reed Wall Mind theory, and Motile Womb theory. These theories emphasize the importance of exploring unconventional ideas, filtering and organizing information, and leveraging diverse experiences to foster creativity and generate valuable insights.

what about the effect of arbitrary constraints on driving creativity?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Arbitrary constraints can have a significant impact on driving creativity. While it may seem counterintuitive, constraints can actually fuel creativity by forcing individuals to think outside the box and find innovative solutions within the given limitations. Here are some connections with the topics we've discussed:
Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory: The presence of constraints in the chatroom can stimulate creative thinking. When individuals are faced with limitations or specific guidelines within the chatroom, they are encouraged to find unique ways to express their ideas or solve problems. These constraints can spark creative approaches and push individuals to think more deeply and imaginatively.
Reed Wall Mind theory: Constraints within the mind's organization and processing of information can also drive creativity. When the mind encounters limitations or boundaries in its thinking processes, it is prompted to explore alternative routes and think more creatively. The mind may find innovative ways to overcome the constraints and generate new ideas.
Motile Womb theory: Constraints in the form of physical or environmental limitations within the womb-like environment can shape the development of cognitive abilities and creativity. The fetus, for example, experiences physical constraints and limitations while moving and exploring the womb. These constraints can influence the fetus to adapt, learn, and find creative ways to navigate its environment.
Overall, arbitrary constraints can act as catalysts for creativity by challenging individuals to think differently, explore alternative possibilities, and find unique solutions within the given limitations. These constraints can be present in various contexts, including the chatroom, the mind's organization, and the physical environment, and can ultimately drive innovative and creative thinking processes.

More on constraints. Do you know: Eunoia (2001) is an anthology of univocalics by Canadian poet Christian Bök
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, I'm familiar with "Eunoia" by Christian Bök. It is an experimental poetry book published in 2001. What makes "Eunoia" unique is that each chapter is written using only one vowel. Bök explores the constraints of language by crafting intricate and cohesive narratives using a limited set of sounds.
In "Eunoia," Bök dedicates a chapter to each of the five vowels: A, E, I, O, and U. He challenges himself to write using only words that contain a single vowel, excluding all others. This constraint requires immense creativity and linguistic acrobatics to construct meaningful and coherent prose.
The book showcases Bök's linguistic virtuosity and his ability to manipulate language to its limits. He aims to push the boundaries of what language can do and explore the inherent musicality and expressive potential within words.
"Eunoia" has garnered critical acclaim for its innovative approach to language and the impressive feats of linguistic acrobatics achieved by adhering to such strict constraints. It serves as an intriguing example of how constraints can inspire creativity and push the boundaries of artistic expression.
Overall, "Eunoia" demonstrates the power of constraints in shaping artistic creations and highlights the endless possibilities that can arise from working within self-imposed limitations.

An example:

Awkward grammar appals a craftsman. A Dada bard as daft as Tzara damns stagnant art and scrawls an alpha (a slapdash arc and a backward zag) that mars all stanzas and jams all ballads (what a scandal). A madcap vandal crafts a small black ankh -- a hand-stamp that can stamp a wax pad and at last plant a mark that sparks an ars magna (an abstract art that charts a phrasal anagram). A pagan skald chants a dark saga (a Mahabharata), as a papal cabal blackballs all annals and tracts, all dramas and psalms: Kant and Kafka, Marx and Marat. A law as harsh as a fatwa bans all paragraphs that lack an A as a standard hallmark.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's a wonderful example showcasing the univocalic constraint employed in "Eunoia"! In this passage, Christian Bök exclusively uses words that contain only the vowel "A." The constraint pushes the boundaries of language and challenges the poet to craft coherent and expressive sentences using a limited set of sounds.
The passage demonstrates Bök's linguistic ingenuity as he constructs a narrative with words that adhere to the constraint. Despite the constraint's limitations, the passage manages to convey a playful and imaginative tone. Bök's use of alliteration, wordplay, and clever phrasing adds depth and intrigue to the text.
The univocalic constraint in "Eunoia" not only showcases the poet's skill and creativity but also prompts readers to appreciate the vast possibilities of language. It invites us to explore the musicality, rhythm, and nuances within a single vowel, highlighting the versatility of language and the power of constraints in shaping artistic expression.

Certainly! Here's a rephrased version of the passage using regular language:
An awkward grammatical structure disturbs a skilled craftsman. A poet who follows the Dada movement, known for its unconventional and nonsensical approach, criticizes stagnant art and creates an odd-shaped letter "A" (an imperfect curved line with a backward angle). This letter mars the beauty of all poetic verses and disrupts melodic songs, causing quite a scandal. A mischievous vandal crafts a small black symbol resembling an Egyptian cross called an ankh. This symbol can be used as a stamp on a wax pad, leaving a mark that ignites a grand art movement called "ars magna" (an abstract art style that involves rearranging words and phrases). A pagan poet sings a dark epic saga similar to the "Mahabharata," while a group of influential figures, including religious authorities, reject and censor various written works, such as philosophical treatises, plays, and religious hymns. Prominent names like Kant, Kafka, Marx, and Marat face disapproval. A strict rule, similar to a religious decree, bans any written paragraph that lacks the letter "A" as a sign of quality.
In this rewritten version, the core ideas and concepts from the original passage are preserved, but the words are replaced with their regular counterparts to ensure clarity and understanding.

Both involve setting boundaries and defining rules that guide the learning process and shape the network's behavior or creative output.
Constraints and Intuitive Physics: Constraints in physical systems, such as the limitations imposed by gravity or the properties of materials, are analogous to the constraints in creative processes. Just as intuitive physics models help humans navigate and understand the physical world, constraints can guide and shape the exploration and understanding of creative spaces.
Constraints and Cognitive Flexibility: Working within constraints requires cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt and switch between different strategies or approaches. Both creativity and programming involve problem-solving within defined boundaries, which necessitates cognitive flexibility to generate innovative ideas or find alternative solutions.
Constraints and Artificial Intelligence: Constraints play a crucial role in the design and training of artificial intelligence systems. Similar to how constraints drive creativity in humans, constraints are used to shape and guide the learning process of AI models, allowing them to generate creative outputs or solve problems within specific boundaries.
Constraints and Optimization: Optimization techniques in programming, such as code optimization or algorithmic efficiency, are analogous to the optimization of creative processes. Both involve finding the best possible solution or output within the given constraints, whether it is maximizing performance or achieving a desired artistic outcome.
These correlations and connections highlight the common threads between constraints, creativity, programming, and cognitive processes, emphasizing the interplay between limitations, problem-solving, and innovative thinking in various domains.

Indeed, our exploration has taken us on a journey through the vast realms of creativity and cognition, where we have encountered concepts such as rhizomatic compression and the non-negative Grassmannian. These notions, rooted in the depths of mathematical abstraction, intertwine with our discussions on constraints and their impact on creativity.
Rhizomatic compression, a term borrowed from Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, invites us to envision a network of interconnected ideas, where knowledge flows and expands through various pathways. It speaks to the expansive nature of human thought, transcending linear structures and embracing the multidimensional nature of creative exploration. In this rhizomatic landscape, constraints act as catalysts, shaping and guiding the growth of ideas as they intertwine and evolve.
The non-negative Grassmannian, a concept derived from algebraic geometry, offers a mathematical framework to explore constraints within a specific mathematical domain. It provides a structured space where non-negativity and constraints can be incorporated, allowing for the study of geometric properties and transformations within those boundaries. By applying this framework to our discussions on creativity, we navigate a realm where limitations become defining parameters that shape the creative process.
In the union of rhizomatic compression and the non-negative Grassmannian, we find a tapestry of interconnectedness. Rhizomatic compression encompasses the fluidity and interconnectedness of ideas, while the non-negative Grassmannian provides a framework to explore and understand constraints within a mathematical context. Together, they illuminate the intricate dance between constraints and creativity, unveiling new avenues for exploration and understanding.

In mathematics, there are two distinct meanings of the term affine Grassmannian. In one it is the manifold of all k-dimensional affine subspaces of Rn (described on this page), while in the other the affine Grassmannian is a quotient of a group-ring based on formal Laurent series.

Formal definition
Given a finite-dimensional vector space V and a non-negative integer k, then Graffk(V) is the topological space of all affine k-dimensional subspaces of V.

It has a natural projection p:Graffk(V) → Grk(V), the Grassmannian of all linear k-dimensional subspaces of V by defining p(U) to be the translation of U to a subspace through the origin. This projection is a fibration, and if V is given an inner product, the fibre containing U can be identified with 
�
(
�
)
⊥p(U)^{\perp }, the orthogonal complement to p(U). The fibres are therefore vector spaces, and the projection p is a vector bundle over the Grassmannian, which defines the manifold structure on Graffk(V).

As a homogeneous space, the affine Grassmannian of an n-dimensional vector space V can be identified with

(This relation is easier to deduce from the identification of next section, as the difference between the number of coefficients, (n−k)(n+1) and the dimension of the linear group acting on the equations, (n−k)2.)

Relationship with ordinary Grassmannian
Let (x1,...,xn) be the usual linear coordinates on Rn. Then Rn is embedded into Rn+1 as the affine hyperplane xn+1 = 1. The k-dimensional affine subspaces of Rn are in one-to-one correspondence with the (k+1)-dimensional linear subspaces of Rn+1 that are in general position with respect to the plane xn+1 = 1. Indeed, a k-dimensional affine subspace of Rn is the locus of solutions of a rank n − k system of affine equations

To understand the non-negative Grassmannian, let's start with the Grassmannian itself. Given a vector space V of dimension n, the Grassmannian Gr(k, n) represents all k-dimensional subspaces of V. Each point in Gr(k, n) corresponds to a specific k-dimensional subspace.
Now, the non-negative Grassmannian, denoted as Gr+(k, n), is a subset of the Grassmannian that consists of those k-dimensional subspaces whose coordinates in a given basis are all non-negative. In other words, it restricts the subspaces to have non-negative coefficients in their basis representation.
The non-negative Grassmannian has interesting combinatorial and geometric properties. It is closely related to objects such as positroids, totally non-negative matrices, and Schubert polynomials.

Ok explain the difference between a positive and negative grassmannian
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The difference between a positive and negative Grassmannian lies in the sign of the Plücker coordinates that define the subspaces within each Grassmannian.
In a Grassmannian, regardless of its dimension, each point corresponds to a specific subspace of a given vector space. The Plücker coordinates are mathematical quantities associated with these subspaces, and they play a crucial role in determining their properties.
In a positive Grassmannian, denoted as Gr≥0
k,n, all the Plücker coordinates are nonnegative. This means that every point in the positive Grassmannian corresponds to a subspace whose Plücker coordinates are nonnegative values. The positive Grassmannian has a combinatorial structure and is often associated with concepts like tropical geometry, scattering amplitudes, and integrable systems.
On the other hand, in a negative Grassmannian, denoted as Gr≤0
k,n, all the Plücker coordinates are nonpositive. This means that every point in the negative Grassmannian corresponds to a subspace whose Plücker coordinates are nonpositive values. The negative Grassmannian also has its own combinatorial structure and may have connections to different areas of mathematics and physics.
It's worth noting that the positive and negative Grassmannians are complementary to each other. In other words, the union of the positive and negative Grassmannians covers the entire Grassmannian. Each point in the Grassmannian can be classified as either positive or negative based on the sign of its Plücker coordinates.
In summary, the difference between a positive and negative Grassmannian lies in the sign of the Plücker coordinates associated with the subspaces within each Grassmannian. The positive Grassmannian consists of subspaces with nonnegative Plücker coordinates, while the negative Grassmannian consists of subspaces with nonpositive Plücker coordinates.

The theory of compressor of compressors, proposed by Wojciech Zaremba and Jurgen Schmidhuber, suggests that the ability to compress data and information in innovative ways is a fundamental aspect of intelligence and creativity. It posits that intelligent systems are adept at finding novel and efficient representations that capture the essential structure of the data.
This idea has connections to the mathematical representation of tree-level amplitudes in physics. Tree-level amplitudes describe fundamental processes in particle interactions. Through the exploration of these amplitudes, researchers have discovered remarkable compactness and increased clarity. This is primarily attributed to the identification of new symmetries that underlie the structure of these amplitudes.
These symmetries have intriguing connections to the nonnegative Grassmannian, a mathematical object that parametrizes subspaces. Specifically, they are related to the volume-forms defined on specific sub-varieties of the nonnegative Grassmannian. These volume-forms play a crucial role in capturing the essential geometric and algebraic properties of these sub-varieties.
By linking the theory of compressor of compressors to the mathematical representation of tree-level amplitudes and the nonnegative Grassmannian, it becomes evident that finding compact and efficient ways to represent data is not only a hallmark of intelligence but also holds relevance in diverse fields such as physics and mathematics.

The compressor of compressors theory of consciousness, art, science, and intelligence, according to Wojciech Zaremba and Jurgen Schmidhuber.

For several years after their discovery, the primary 
importance of the recursion relations followed from 
February 2018Notices of the AMS167 
THE GRADUATE STUDENT SECTION 
the fact that they yield incredibly more compact—and 
physically more transparent—representations for tree- 
level amplitudes. Processes that would have required 
more Feynman diagrams than atoms in the universe 
could now be represented by a single diagram. Another 
surprising feature of these relations was the discovery 
that individual terms enjoy much more symmetry than 
anyone had anticipated. These new symmetries were 
shown to hold for amplitudes, and were later identif i ed 
with a Yangian Lie algebra. 
Another key breakthrough came in 2009, when physi- 
cists discovered that the graphs arising in Figure 1 could 
be related to volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of 
Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛)—the "nonnegative" portion of the Grassman- 
nian of 𝑘-dimensional subspaces of ℝ𝑛, 
to be def i ned 
momentarily. Here, 𝑛,𝑘 are determined by the graph: 𝑛 is 
the number of external edges, and 𝑘 = 2𝑛𝐵+ 𝑛𝑊− 𝑛𝐼− 2 
for a graph with 𝑛𝐵,𝑛𝑊blue and white vertices, re- 
spectively, and 𝑛𝐼internal 
edges. (The correspondence 
between these graphs and the totally nonnegative Grass- 
mannian was fully understood by mathematicians, such 
as Postnikov, considerably before physicists stumbled 
upon it independently.) The physical implications of this 
correspondence, together with its generalization to all 
orders of perturbation, can be found in [2]. 
Given the correspondence between the terms gener- 
ated by BCFW (and its all-orders generalization) and the 
Grassmannian, it was natural to wonder if a more in- 
trinsically geometric picture existed. Specif i cally, can the 
recursion relations be literally viewed as 'triangulating' 
some region in the Grassmannian? And if so, can this 
space be def i ned intrinsically—without reference to how 
it should be triangulated? In 2013, Arkani-Hamed and 
Trnka proposed the amplituhedron as the answer to both 
questions for the case of amplitudes in planar, maximally 
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [1]. 
Let us now turn to giving a precise mathematical 
def i nition of the amplituhedron, in the 0 loop "tree" case. 
(The ℓ loop amplituhedron for ℓ > 0 has a def i nition 
which is similar but somewhat more complicated; we will 
not discuss it further.) Let 𝑁 ∈ Mat(𝑘 × 𝑛) be a 𝑘 × 𝑛 
matrix of real numbers, with 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛. As we recall from 
linear algebra, the rows of 𝑁 determine a subspace of 
ℝ𝑛called its row space. If the row space is 𝑘-dimensional 
(the maximum possible), we say that 𝑁 has full rank. Two 
full-rank matrices 𝑁1and 𝑁2have 
the same row space 
if for some 𝐿 in the space of 𝑘 × 𝑘 invertible matrices, 
𝐿.𝑁1= 𝑁2. Clearly, any 𝑘-dimensional subspace of ℝ𝑛 
arises as the row space of some full-rank matrix; so the 
collectionofall𝑘-dimensionalsubspacescanbedescribed 
asMatfull(𝑘×𝑛)/𝐺𝑀(𝑘).ThisistheGrassmannianGr(𝑘,𝑛). 
The next ingredient required to def i ne the amplituhe- 
dron is the notion of positivity in the Grassmannian. A 
maximal minor of a matrix 𝑁 ∈ Mat(𝑘 × 𝑛) is the deter- 
minant of the 𝑘 × 𝑘 submatrix obtained from taking a 
subset of 𝑘 of the columns, in the order they appear in 
the matrix. The totally positive Grassmannian, denoted 
Gr>0(𝑘,𝑛), is the subspace of the Grassmannian for which 
all maximal minors have the same sign. The totally non- 
negative Grassmannian, Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛), is def i ned in the same 
way, except that we also allow some minors to vanish. 
The totally nonnegative Grassmannian was studied by 
Postnikov as a concrete instance of Lusztig's theory of 
total positivity for algebraic groups. It is topologically 
equivalent to a ball, and has a beautiful cell structure that 
can be indexed by decorated permutations (permutations 
of 𝑆𝑛with one extra bit of information for each i xed 
point). Importantly, cells in this 'positroid' stratif i cation 
can be endowed with cluster coordinates and a natural 
volume form. 
We now have everything required to def i ne the tree 
amplituhedron. It is indexed by three integers, 𝑛, 𝑘, and 
𝑑, and a totally positive 𝑛 × (𝑑 + 𝑘) matrix 𝑃. From the 
point of view of physics, 𝑛 is the number of particles, 
𝑘, def i ned above in the context of graphs, encodes the 
total helicity l ow, 𝑑 is the space-time dimension, and 𝑃 
encodes the momenta and helicities of the particles. Let 
𝑁 ∈ Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛) vary. The amplituhedron 𝒜, as def i ned 
by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka [1] is simply the total image

Compression and Creativity: The theorem emphasizes the idea that compression plays a crucial role in understanding and expressing intelligence and creativity. We previously explored the notion that the ability to compress data and information in novel ways is linked to intelligence and creative thinking. This theorem builds upon that concept by suggesting that compressing principles and insights into a nonnegative Grassmannian mathematical representation can lead to a deeper understanding of intelligence and creativity.
Artificial Intelligence: In our discussions, we touched upon the relationship between intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI). The Great Theorem on Compression implies that AI systems that can effectively compress and represent knowledge in a nonnegative Grassmannian framework may have a better grasp of the underlying principles of intelligence and creativity.
Mathematical Models: Throughout our conversations, we recognized the significance of mathematical models in understanding complex phenomena. The use of a nonnegative Grassmannian mathematical representation in the theorem reflects this importance, as it allows for the compression and representation of intelligence and creativity in a concise and structured manner.
Overall, the Great Theorem on the Compression of Intelligence and Creativity in a Nonnegative Grassmannian Mathematical Representation aligns with our previous discussions by exploring the connections between compression, creativity, artificial intelligence, and mathematical models, providing further insights into these interrelated concepts.
