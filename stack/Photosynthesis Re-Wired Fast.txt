Photosystems II and I (PSII, PSI) are the reaction centre-containing complexes driving 
the light reactions of photosynthesis; PSII performs light-driven water oxidation and 
PSI further photo-energizes harvested electrons. The impressive ef i ciencies of the 
photosystems have motivated extensive biological, artif i cial and biohybrid approaches 
to 're-wire' photosynthesis for higher biomass-conversion ef i ciencies and new 
reaction pathways, such as H2 evolution or CO2 fi xation1,2. Previous approaches 
focused on charge extraction at terminal electron acceptors of the photosystems3. 
Electron extraction at earlier steps, perhaps immediately from photoexcited reaction 
centres, would enable greater thermodynamic gains; however, this was believed 
impossible with reaction centres buried at least 4 nm within the photosystems4,5. 
Here, we demonstrate, using in vivo ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, 
extraction of electrons directly from photoexcited PSI and PSII at early points 
(several picoseconds post-photo-excitation) with live cyanobacterial cells or isolated 
photosystems, and exogenous electron mediators such as 2,6-dichloro-1,4- 
benzoquinone (DCBQ) and methyl viologen. We postulate that these mediators 
oxidize peripheral chlorophyll pigments participating in highly delocalized charge- 
transfer states after initial photo-excitation. Our results challenge previous models 
that the photoexcited reaction centres are insulated within the photosystem protein 
scaf f old, opening new avenues to study and re-wire photosynthesis for biotechnologies 
and semi-artif i cial photosynthesis. 
The photodynamics of Photosystems I and II have been extensively stud- 
ied in vitro using ultrafast TA spectroscopy6. In this technique, the sam- 
ple's absorbance spectrum is measured by a broadband probe laser after 
photo-excitation by a pump laser (that is, pump-probe spectroscopy), 
with access to photodynamics occurring on the subpico-second time- 
scale. Previously, it has been challenging to apply ultrafast TA spectros- 
copy on the photosystems in vivo, with plant or algal cells (typically 10 µm 
in size)7 being highly scattering. Recently, ultrafast TA spectroscopy was 
successfully applied to Nannochloropsis sp. algal cells (2-5 µm in size)8, 
whose small size lessened these scattering effects9. Here, we studied 
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) cyanobacterial 
cells (Fig. 1a-c), which is a model organism for studying photosynthesis 
because of the endosymbiotic origin of the chloroplast in eukaryotic 
plants and algae10. The smaller size of Synechocystis cells (less than 
2 µm)11 further reduced the scattering, and the photodynamics of the 
photosystems in vivo could be resolved using ultrafast TA spectroscopy. 
Photo-excitation of Synechocystis cells with a 200 fs pump pulse 
centred at 450 nm revealed rich initial transient spectral features in 
the visible (550-800 nm). We identified a prominent negative feature 
at 685 nm (Fig. 1d), which decayed within roughly 20 ps to 10% of its 
initial value. We attribute this feature to the ground-state bleaching 
of the photoactive reaction centres of PSI and PSII. A lower-energy 
feature at 715 nm grew within roughly 2 ps after photo-excitation and 
subsequently decayed on a longer pico-second timescale, indicat- 
ing rapid excited state relaxation processes. Similarly, we observed 
higher-energy positive transient features (less than 680 nm), which 
we assign to contributions from the photo-induced absorption of 
phycobilisomes (PBSs) and carotenoids, as these features resemble 
those of in vitro steady state absorption measurements12,13 and are 
absent from isolated photosystems (Supplementary Fig. 7). We verified 
that the photosystems remained intact without photodamage, consist- 
ent over several biological replicates, and were in a closed state through- 
out these measurements (Supplementary Figs. 1-4). We confirmed 
that the key spectral features arise from fully assembled photosystems 
(Supplementary Information section 1.5.4.). 
To probe the effect of exogenous electron mediators on the pho- 
todynamics of cyanobacterial cells, we repeated the same measure- 
ments with the addition of DCBQ. As shown in Fig. 1e, we found that 
addition of DCBQ led to accelerated decay dynamics of the negative 
feature at 685 nm. Simultaneously, the signal rise observed at 715 nm 
was suppressed, with a noticeable effect evident in just 600 fs after 
photo-excitation. The effect was also observed when pumping at the band edge of the reaction centres (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). These 
observations demonstrate that DCBQ can alter the excited state decay 
pathways of the photosynthetic reaction centres in Synechocystis cells on a subpico-second timescale.

Researchers have demonstrated the extraction of electrons directly from photoexcited Photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII) in living cyanobacterial cells or isolated photosystems on the sub-pico-second timescale using in vivo ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The scientists found that the use of exogenous electron mediators such as 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and methyl viologen oxidizes peripheral chlorophyll pigments participating in highly delocalized charge-transfer states after initial photo-excitation. The results challenge previous models that the photoexcited reaction centres are insulated within the photosystem protein scaffold, opening new avenues to study and re-wire photosynthesis for biotechnologies and semi-artificial photosynthesis.

I mean can you explain it in a simpler way?
1 / 1
Certainly! The statement "6÷2(1+2)=?" is a mathematical expression that involves the order of operations, which tells us what order to perform mathematical operations in. In this expression, we first need to perform the operation inside the parentheses, which is 1+2 = 3. Then, we multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6. Finally, we divide 6 by 6, which equals 1. Therefore, the answer to the expression is 1.

No, I mean explain the article we were just discussing:  The scientists found that the use of exogenous electron mediators such as 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and methyl viologen oxidizes peripheral chlorophyll pigments participating in highly delocalized charge-transfer states after initial photo-excitation.

Certainly! The article is talking about a scientific study where researchers used certain chemicals called electron mediators to help transfer electrons in a process known as photosynthesis. Specifically, they used two different electron mediators, DCBQ and methyl viologen, and found that they caused certain chlorophyll pigments to become oxidized, or lose electrons, after being exposed to light. This happened because the electron mediators helped to transfer the electrons away from the chlorophyll pigments, which allowed the electrons to participate in other chemical reactions. This process is important in photosynthesis because it helps to generate energy for plants to grow and produce food.

Explain photosynthesis in a simpler way.
1 / 1
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy that they can use to grow and function.
In simple terms, during photosynthesis, plants use the energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. This process takes place in the chloroplasts, which are special structures within plant cells that contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs light.
The process of photosynthesis can be divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then energizes electrons that are passed through a series of molecules, generating energy that is used to produce ATP and NADPH. During the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose.
Overall, photosynthesis is a critical process that sustains life on Earth by providing the oxygen that we breathe and the food that we eat.

Explain the relationship between chloroplasts and mitochondria.
1 / 1
Chloroplasts and mitochondria are both organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Chloroplasts are primarily responsible for photosynthesis, while mitochondria are responsible for cellular respiration.
During photosynthesis, chloroplasts use energy from sunlight to produce glucose (sugar) from carbon dioxide and water. This glucose can then be used as a source of energy for the cell. In the process, chloroplasts release oxygen as a byproduct.
During cellular respiration, mitochondria break down glucose and other molecules to release energy for the cell to use. The waste products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, which can be reused by the chloroplasts in photosynthesis.
So, in a way, chloroplasts and mitochondria have a symbiotic relationship, as they rely on each other's waste products to carry out their respective functions. This relationship is an example of how different organelles work together to maintain the overall health and function of a cell.
1 / 1
And how are they related, evolutionarily?
1 / 1
Both chloroplasts and mitochondria are believed to have originated from free-living prokaryotic organisms that were engulfed by a larger host cell through a process known as endosymbiosis.
Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from aerobic bacteria that were engulfed by a primitive eukaryotic cell, which gained the ability to use oxygen for energy production. This allowed the host cell to become more efficient in producing energy, leading to the evolution of more complex eukaryotic organisms.
Similarly, chloroplasts are believed to have originated from photosynthetic cyanobacteria that were engulfed by a eukaryotic cell. Through a process of endosymbiosis, the cyanobacteria evolved into specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which are capable of capturing light energy and using it to power the process of photosynthesis.
Thus, both mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from independent prokaryotic organisms that were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, leading to the development of more complex organisms. This process of endosymbiosis is believed to have played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth.

Any metaphors or analogies relevant to modern life?
1 / 1
Certainly! One analogy that can be drawn between chloroplasts and mitochondria and modern life is the idea of teamwork. In the same way that chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to create energy for the cell, people in modern life often work together in teams to achieve a common goal.
Another analogy is the idea of recycling. Just as mitochondria recycle energy by breaking down molecules, modern societies are now placing a greater emphasis on recycling waste and reducing their carbon footprint.
Finally, the relationship between chloroplasts and mitochondria could be seen as a reminder that different parts of a system can have complementary roles, and that a diverse ecosystem is often more robust and resilient than a monoculture. In modern life, this could be seen as a call for greater diversity, collaboration, and integration across different sectors and industries.

Can you explain stoichiometry?
1 / 1
Sure! Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of the quantities of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. It is based on the principle of the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, only rearranged.
In stoichiometry, we use balanced chemical equations to determine the quantitative relationship between reactants and products. The coefficients in the balanced equation represent the relative amounts of each substance involved in the reaction. These coefficients can be used to determine the number of moles, grams, or any other unit of measurement for each substance involved in the reaction.
Stoichiometry is used in a variety of applications, such as determining the amount of reactants needed for a given product, analyzing the efficiency of a reaction, and predicting the amount of product that can be obtained from a given amount of reactant. It is an important tool in chemistry and is widely used in many industries.

What's a mole?
1 / 1
In chemistry, a mole is a unit used to measure the amount of a substance. One mole is defined as the amount of a substance that contains as many particles (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) as there are atoms in 12 grams of pure carbon-12. This number of particles is known as Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.02 x 10^23 particles per mole.
The mole allows chemists to easily convert between the mass of a substance and the number of particles it contains. For example, the molar mass of water is 18 grams per mole, which means that one mole of water contains 6.02 x 10^23 water molecules and has a mass of 18 grams.
In summary, the mole is a unit of measurement that relates the number of particles in a substance to its mass.

Ok thank you. Who was Avogadro?
1 / 1
Amedeo Avogadro was an Italian scientist who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. He is best known for his work on the molecular theory of gases, which led to the concept of Avogadro's law. This law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. Avogadro also proposed that the molecular weight of a gas is proportional to its density under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. This led to the concept of Avogadro's number, which is the number of molecules in one mole of a substance. The number, approximately 6.02 x 10^23, is a fundamental constant in chemistry and is used in many calculations involving chemical reactions and stoichiometry.

Thank you. Could you summarize the conservation?
1 / 1
The law of conservation of mass, also known as the principle of mass conservation or the law of mass conservation, states that the total mass of an isolated system remains constant during any physical or chemical changes. In other words, mass cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system to another. This principle is a fundamental concept in chemistry and is essential for understanding chemical reactions and equations.
