Summarize: High-temperature electrolysis (also HTE or steam electrolysis or HTSE) is a technology for producing hydrogen from water at high temperatures.[1]


High-temperature electrolysis schema.

Efficiency
Edit
High temperature electrolysis is more efficient economically than traditional room-temperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and also because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures. In fact, at 2500 ��C, electrical input is unnecessary because water breaks down to hydrogen and oxygen through thermolysis. Such temperatures are impractical; proposed HTE systems operate between 100 ��C and 850 ��C.[2][3][4]

If one assumes that the electricity used comes from a heat engine, it takes 141.86 megajoules (MJ) of heat energy to produce one kg of hydrogen[clarification needed], for the HTE process itself and for the electricity required. At 100 ��C, 350 MJ of thermal energy are required (41% efficient). At 850 ��C, 225 MJ are required (64% efficient). Above 850 ��C, one begins to exceed the capacity of standard chromium steels to resist corrosion,[5] and it's already no easy matter to design and implement an industrial scale chemical process to operate at such a high temperature point.

High-temperature electrolysis (HTE) is a method for producing hydrogen from water using high temperatures, making it more economically efficient than traditional room-temperature electrolysis. The efficiency is increased by supplying some energy as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and the reaction is more effective at higher temperatures. While water can break down into hydrogen and oxygen through thermolysis at 2500 ��C, HTE systems usually operate between 100 ��C and 850 ��C. The efficiency ranges from 41% at 100 ��C to 64% at 850 ��C. Beyond 850 ��C, corrosion resistance becomes a significant issue, making the design and implementation of industrial-scale processes challenging.

Even with HTE, electrolysis is a fairly inefficient way to store energy. Significant conversion losses of energy occur both in the electrolysis process, and in the conversion of the resulting hydrogen back into power.

At current hydrocarbon prices, HTE can not compete with pyrolysis of hydrocarbons as an economical source of hydrogen, which produces carbon dioxide as a by-product.

HTE is of interest as a more efficient route to the production "green" hydrogen, to be used as a carbon neutral fuel and general energy storage. It may become economical if cheap non-fossil fuel sources of heat (concentrating solar, nuclear, geothermal, waste heat) can be used in conjunction with non-fossil fuel sources of electricity (such as solar, wind, ocean, nuclear).

Possible supplies of cheap high-temperature heat for HTE are all nonchemical, including nuclear reactors, concentrating solar thermal collectors, and geothermal sources. HTE has been demonstrated in a laboratory at 108 kilojoules (electric) per gram of hydrogen produced,[7] but not at a commercial scale.

Even though High-temperature electrolysis (HTE) is more efficient than traditional methods, it remains an inefficient way to store energy, with significant conversion losses in both the electrolysis process and converting hydrogen back into power. Currently, HTE cannot compete economically with hydrogen derived from hydrocarbon pyrolysis, which produces CO2 as a by-product.
HTE is appealing for producing "green" hydrogen, a carbon-neutral fuel and energy storage option. It could become economically viable if non-fossil fuel sources of heat (such as concentrating solar, nuclear, geothermal, waste heat) and electricity (like solar, wind, ocean, nuclear) are utilized.
Potential sources of inexpensive high-temperature heat for HTE include nonchemical options like nuclear reactors, concentrating solar thermal collectors, and geothermal sources. Though HTE has been demonstrated in the laboratory, it has not yet been implemented at a commercial scale.

Abstract

The development of visible light-active photocatalysts is essential for increasing the conversion efficiency of solar energy into hydrogen (H2). Here, we present a facile method for nitrogen doping of monolithic titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle-based aerogels to activate them for visible light. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at low temperature enables efficient incorporation of nitrogen into preformed TiO2 aerogels without compromising their advantageous intrinsic characteristics such as large surface area, extensive porosity, and nanoscale properties of the semiconducting building blocks. By balancing the dopant concentration and the defects, the nitridation improves optical absorption and charge separation efficiency. The nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticle-based aerogels loaded with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles show a significant enhancement in visible light-driven photocatalytic H2 production (3.1 mmol h���1 g���1) with excellent stability over 5 days. With this method, we introduce a powerful tool to tune the properties of nanoparticle-based aerogels after synthesis for a specific application, as exemplified by visible light-driven H2 production.

The publication titled "Gas-Phase Nitrogen Doping of Monolithic TiO2 Nanoparticle-Based Aerogels for Efficient Visible Light-Driven Photocatalytic H2 Production" presents a method for enhancing the conversion efficiency of solar energy into hydrogen (H2) through the development of visible light-active photocatalysts.
The authors introduce a simple method for nitrogen doping of monolithic titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle-based aerogels, making them active for visible light. This is achieved through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at low temperatures, allowing for the incorporation of nitrogen without affecting the inherent characteristics of the TiO2 aerogels, like their large surface area and extensive porosity.
By balancing the dopant concentration and defects, the process improves optical absorption and charge separation efficiency. When loaded with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles, the nitrogen-doped TiO2 aerogels significantly enhance visible light-driven photocatalytic H2 production, showing a rate of 3.1 mmol per hour per gram and maintaining stability over five days.
The method offers a powerful way to tailor the properties of nanoparticle-based aerogels after synthesis, providing a promising avenue for efficient visible light-driven hydrogen production.

There are hundreds of thermochemical cycles known to directly convert heat into hydrogen from water. For instance, the thermochemical sulfur-iodine cycle. Since the electricity generation step has a fairly low efficiency and is eliminated, thermochemical production might reach higher efficiencies than HTE. However, large-scale thermochemical production will require significant advances in materials that can withstand high-temperature, high-pressure, highly corrosive environments.

The pyrolysis (or devolatilization) process is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures, often in an inert atmosphere.[1] Temperature can be understood as thermal vibration. At high temperatures, excessive vibration causes long chain molecules to break into smaller molecules. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro "fire", "heat", "fever" and lysis "separating".


Burning pieces of wood, showing various stages of pyrolysis followed by oxidative combustion.
Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials. It is one of the processes involved in charring wood.[2] In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves char, a carbon-rich solid residue. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly carbon as the residue, is called carbonization. Pyrolysis is considered the first step in the processes of gasification or combustion.[3][4]

The process is used heavily in the chemical industry, for example, to produce ethylene, many forms of carbon, and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, or to produce coke from coal. It is used also in the conversion of natural gas (primarily methane) into hydrogen gas and solid carbon char, recently introduced on an industrial scale.[5] Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert biomass into syngas and biochar, waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances

Pyrolysis is one of the various types of chemical degradation processes that occur at higher temperatures (above the boiling point of water or other solvents). It differs from other processes like combustion and hydrolysis in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as oxygen (O2, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).[6] Pyrolysis produces solids (char), condensable liquids, (light and heavy oils and tar), and non-condensable gasses.[7][8][9][10]

Pyrolysis is different from Gasification. In the chemical process industry, pyrolysis refers to a partial thermal degradation of carbonaceous materials that takes place in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere and produces both gases, liquids and solids. The pyrolysis can be extended to full gasification that produces mainly gaseous output,[11] often with the addition of e.g. water steam to gasify residual carbonic solids, see Steam reforming.

Pyrolysis is a distinct chemical degradation process that occurs at higher temperatures, typically above the boiling point of water or other solvents. Unlike combustion and hydrolysis, pyrolysis usually doesn't involve the addition of other reagents like oxygen (in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).
In pyrolysis, the partial thermal degradation of carbonaceous materials takes place in an inert (oxygen-free) atmosphere. This process results in a mix of solids (char), condensable liquids (such as light and heavy oils and tar), and non-condensable gases.
It's important to note that pyrolysis differs from gasification. While pyrolysis involves partial degradation, producing gases, liquids, and solids, gasification can extend the process to mainly produce gaseous output. This may include adding substances like water steam to gasify residual carbonic solids, as seen in steam reforming. Thus, pyrolysis can be seen as a step before full gasification, each with unique characteristics and applications.

Hydrous pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermal depolymerization process used to convert wet biomass, and other macromolecules, into crude-like oil under moderate temperature and high pressure.[1] The crude-like oil has high energy density with a lower heating value of 33.8-36.9 MJ/kg and 5-20 wt% oxygen and renewable chemicals.[2][3]

Hydrous pyrolysis, also known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), is a specific method used to convert wet biomass and other macromolecules into a crude-like oil. This process is conducted under moderate temperatures and high pressure. Unlike traditional pyrolysis, hydrous pyrolysis involves the presence of water, giving it distinct characteristics.
The oil produced through HTL has a high energy density, with a lower heating value ranging from 33.8 to 36.9 MJ/kg, and contains 5-20% oxygen and renewable chemicals. This makes the process particularly attractive for converting biomass into valuable fuels and chemicals, offering a pathway towards more sustainable energy and material solutions.

The reaction usually involves homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalysts to improve the quality of products and yields.[1] Carbon and hydrogen of an organic material, such as biomass, peat or low-ranked coals (lignite) are thermo-chemically converted into hydrophobic compounds with low viscosity and high solubility. Depending on the processing conditions, the fuel can be used as produced for heavy engines, including marine and rail or upgraded to transportation fuels,[4] such as diesel, gasoline or jet-fuels.

The process may be significant in the creation of fossil fuels.[5] Simple heating without water, anhydrous pyrolysis has long been considered to take place naturally during the catagenesis of kerogens to fossil fuels. In recent decades it has been found that water under pressure causes more efficient breakdown of kerogens at lower temperatures than without it. The carbon isotope ratio of natural gas also suggests that hydrogen from water has been added during creation of the gas.

ChatGPT
Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) can be further enhanced through the use of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalysts. These catalysts help improve the quality of the products and increase the yields. The process converts the carbon and hydrogen found in organic materials like biomass, peat, or low-ranked coals into hydrophobic compounds. These have low viscosity and high solubility, making them suitable for various applications.
Depending on the specific processing conditions, the resulting fuel can be used directly in heavy engines, such as those found in marine and rail transport, or it can be further refined into transportation fuels like diesel, gasoline, or jet fuels.
Interestingly, HTL also has implications for our understanding of fossil fuel creation. While anhydrous pyrolysis (without water) has long been considered a natural step in the formation of fossil fuels, recent research has shown that water under pressure can cause a more efficient breakdown of kerogens at lower temperatures. This has led to the recognition that HTL may be a significant process in the natural creation of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and the carbon isotope ratio in natural gas seems to support this idea. This insight adds to our understanding of geological processes and may influence how we approach the utilization and creation of synthetic fuels.

The HTL process differs from pyrolysis as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.[21] The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.[1]

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).[22] HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.[22][23]

The energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) of these processes is uncertain and/or has not been measured. Furthermore, products of hydrous pyrolysis might not meet current fuel standards. Further processing may be required to produce fuels.[24]

ChatGPT
Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis are both thermal processes used to convert biomass into fuel, but they differ in significant ways:
Biomass Moisture Content
: HTL can handle wet biomass, including materials that contain up to 90% water content or more. Pyrolysis, on the other hand, typically requires a water content of less than 40% to efficiently convert the biomass into bio-oil. This means that biomass must often be dried for pyrolysis, increasing energy requirements, whereas HTL can process very wet biomass, such as tropical grasses or aquatic species.
Energy Density
: The bio-oil produced through HTL contains roughly twice the energy density of the oil produced through pyrolysis, making it a more potent energy source.
Carbon Content
: HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock's carbon content in a single pass. This efficiency makes HTL an attractive process for producing high-carbon fuels.
Integration with Existing Infrastructure
: HTL oil has the potential to be a "drop-in" fuel, meaning it can be directly distributed within the existing petroleum infrastructure. This ease of integration may promote quicker adoption and utilization of HTL-produced fuels.
EROEI and Fuel Standards
: The energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) for these processes is still uncertain and may require further study to fully understand. Additionally, the products of hydrous pyrolysis might not meet current fuel standards without further processing.
In summary, while both HTL and pyrolysis can be used to produce biofuels, HTL has advantages in processing wet biomass and producing a higher energy density fuel. The ability to directly integrate HTL-produced fuel into existing infrastructure adds to its potential appeal. However, understanding the energy efficiency and ensuring compliance with fuel standards remain areas that may require further exploration and development.
