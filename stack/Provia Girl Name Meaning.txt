Now the Greek and Latin roots, preferably going back to PIE. Pro-via. I suspect it could be interpreted as Pro-Life or Towards the Way.
The etymology of the name Provia is not clear. The "Pro-" prefix is Latin, meaning "for" or "on behalf of", and "via" is Latin for "way" or "road", so it could be interpreted as "for the way" or "on behalf of the road." However, it is not clear if this is the intended meaning behind the name, as it is not a commonly used word in Latin and it's not found any ancient records. The name Provia may have been coined more recently.

In the film it is the prophecy of Someone with a North Hedonic Setpoint, with a psychology based on Gradients of Bliss, according to Pearce or Deutsch, I can't remember which. And a depictions of the Ideal Woman according to Ayn Rand's epistemology of Objectivist Philosophy.The book is a recapitalization or reimagining of the movie the Matrix, but it is a prototype or protopia not a dystopia.
If the character Provia in your play is based on the prophecy of someone with a North Hedonic Setpoint, it would mean that she is someone who is naturally inclined to experience higher levels of pleasure and happiness. She would be someone who is able to find joy and meaning in the world around her, and who is able to maintain a positive outlook on life even in the face of challenges and adversity.
In terms of the depiction of the Ideal Woman according to Ayn Rand's Objectivist Philosophy, Provia would be seen as a strong, independent woman who is capable of thinking for herself and making her own choices.

It sounds like your play is reimagining the idea of the Matrix movie, but in a different context, showing a prototype or protopia, a society that is not a dystopia, but an ideal one. The idea of Provia being a representation of the Ideal Woman according to Ayn Rand's Objectivist Philosophy, and the prophecy of someone with a North Hedonic Setpoint, could be an interesting exploration of how these concepts can be applied in a positive and uplifting way, rather than a dystopian setting.
It could be "prototype of protopia" or "prototopia" a kind of term I am inventing to mean proto-utopia or proto-protopia.
"Prototopia" is an interesting term you've coined, which could be interpreted as a "prototype of utopia" or a "proto-protopia." This term would suggest that the society depicted in your play is not fully realized utopia, but rather a work in progress, a prototype of an ideal society that is still being developed and refined.
