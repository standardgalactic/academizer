Embracing the Void: Rethinking the Origin of the Sacred
Front Cover
Richard Boothby
Northwestern University Press, Nov 15, 2022 - Philosophy - 249 pages
A radical reinterpretation of the origin of religion through a psychoanalytic theorization of the unknown

Renowned psychoanalytic philosopher Richard Boothby puts forward a novel theory of religion inspired by Jacques Lacan's theory of das Ding, the disquieting, inaccessible dimension of fellow human beings. This notion of an unfathomable excess, originally encountered in the figure of the mother, led Lacan to break with Freud's formulation of the Oedipus complex and underlies Lacan's distinctive conception of unconscious dynamics. Leaning on this account, Boothby shows how our sense of the sacred arises from our relation to what we do not know.

Embracing the Void lays out the range of Freud's attempts at a psychoanalytic theory of religion and then sketches the rough contours of Lacan's contrasting approach. From there, Boothby offers the theoretical tools for interpreting the religious impulse and analyzes key religious traditions, from ancient Greek polytheism to Judaism and Christianity, and from Hinduism and Buddhism to Islam, finally turning to modern capitalist culture and the seductive deity that dominates it—money. Lucid, accessible, and compelling, the book provides a cogent intervention in one of the psychoanalytic tradition's most contentious topics and offers a new approach to our understanding of religion.

Embracing the Void: Rethinking the Origin of the Sacred by Richard Boothby is a deep dive into the psychoanalytic roots of religion, reframing the sacred not as a response to fear or authority, but as something emerging from our confrontation with the unknown—what Lacan calls das Ding. Boothby contrasts Freud's Oedipal framework with Lacan's radical departure, emphasizing the haunting, excessive quality of the maternal figure as foundational to the human experience of the sacred.

The book tracks this concept through multiple religious traditions, showing how different cultures have responded to this enigmatic void at the heart of human desire. By the end, Boothby pivots to our present moment, diagnosing capitalism's "sacred object"—money—as the modern stand-in for das Ding.

If you're into psychoanalysis, philosophy of religion, or just want a thought-provoking reinterpretation of how we relate to the unknown, this looks like a rich and challenging read.

Death and Desire : Psychoanalytic Theory in Lacan's Return to Freud
Routledge. 2015.
The immensely influential work of Jacques Lacan challenges readers both for the difficulty of its style and for the wide range of intellectual references that frame its innovations. Lacan's work is challenging too, for the way it recentres psychoanalysis on one of the most controversial points of Freud's theory - the concept of a self-destructive drive or 'death instinct'. Originally published in 1991, _Death and Desire_ presents in Lacanian terms a new integration of psychoanalytic theory in wh...Read more

Routledge. 2001.
Using Jacques Lacan's work as a key, this groundbreaking work reassesses the philosophical significance of Freud's most ambitious general theory of mental functioning: metapsychology. Richard Boothby forcefully argues that this theory has been misunderstood, and that therefore Freud's impact on philosophy has been unjustly muted.

The lost cause of mourning
Continental Philosophy Review 46 (2): 209-221. 2013.
This paper examines the evolution of Jacques Lacan's concept of mourning from his treatment of Hamlet in Seminar 6, "Desire and Its Interpretation," to its transformation in the tenth Seminar on "Anxiety." It is a transformation that occurs in tandem with Lacan's reconception of anxiety as lack of the lack and his reshaped conception of the objet a as object/cause of desire. The key point is the way that Lacan's renovated conception upends the common sense notion of mourning, that which assumes ...Read more

Language, Desire, and Death in Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical Reading of Lacan's Return of Freud
Dissertation, Boston University. 1987.
This thesis is an inquiry into the conceptual architecture of psychoanalysis, guided by the work of Jacques Lacan. The primary objective is to make new sense of Freud's hypothesis of a primordial impulse of self-destructiveness: the so-called "death instinct." The general conclusion is to identify the dualism of the life and death instincts with the opposition between what Lacan calls "imaginary" and "symbolic" functions.

ChatGPT dijo:
Richard Boothby's philosophical work revolves around a consistent and evolving engagement with psychoanalytic theory, particularly as developed by Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. Here's a synthesis of his intellectual project across books, articles, and his dissertation:

Core Themes in Boothby's Philosophy
1. Desire, Death, and the Unconscious
Across nearly all of his works, Boothby returns to the dynamic of desire and the death drive. In line with Lacan, he interprets the death instinct not as a biological phenomenon but as a structural component of subjectivity—a force tied to loss, lack, and repetition.

In his dissertation and later in Death and Desire, he reinterprets Freud's death drive through Lacan's symbolic/imaginary distinction.

In "The Lost Cause of Mourning" (2013), he explores mourning and anxiety through Lacan's concept of objet a, tying loss and desire into the very structure of subject formation.

2. Language and Meaning
Boothby frequently positions the unconscious as structured like a language, following Lacan. He explores the symbolic register as the domain through which meaning and identity emerge—and fragment.

Freud as Philosopher (2001) seeks to reconnect Freud with metaphysical and epistemological questions, challenging the view that Freud was a proto-scientific thinker by emphasizing the philosophical resonance of metapsychology.

3. Religion and the Sacred
In Embracing the Void (2023), Boothby turns to religion as a culturally codified response to the unknowable Real—what Lacan names das Ding. The sacred, then, is a human response to the traumatic encounter with the Otherness at the heart of being.

4. Sexuality and Gender
In Sex on the Couch, he revisits Freudian ideas about sex, linking them to contemporary debates on gender identity, and emphasizing the psychoanalytic insight that sexual identity is always haunted by lack and contradiction.

5. Phenomenology and Psychoanalysis
In earlier academic articles like Heideggerian Psychiatry? (1993), Boothby critiques existential approaches (e.g., Medard Boss) for ignoring the Freudian unconscious, defending Lacan's idea that subjectivity is always divided and cannot be fully accessed through conscious experience.

Philosophical Influences and Interlocutors
Jacques Lacan: The single most important influence. Boothby uses Lacanian structures (Real, Imaginary, Symbolic, objet a) as analytic tools throughout his work.

Sigmund Freud: Treated as a thinker of metaphysical weight, not just a clinical theorist.

Martin Heidegger: An occasional foil; Boothby critiques Heideggerian approaches for lacking an account of the unconscious.

Slavoj Žižek: Boothby's work appears alongside Žižek in edited volumes, and they share overlapping terrain—especially around desire, ideology, and the sacred.

Boothby's Trajectory
His early work was focused on building a philosophical interpretation of Lacan. Over time, he expanded into interdisciplinary applications: religion, ethics, gender, capitalism, and mourning. His recent work (Blown Away) brings these insights to bear on personal loss, showing how philosophical and psychoanalytic ideas can be existentially lived.

I am wondering how his work would integrate with and incorporate psychocinema by Helen Rollins? 
ChatGPT dijo:
​Richard Boothby and Helen Rollins both delve deeply into Lacanian psychoanalysis, particularly focusing on how the concept of "lack" shapes human subjectivity. While Boothby explores this through the lens of religion and the sacred, Rollins examines it within the realm of cinema.​

Shared Foundations:

Lacanian Psychoanalysis: Both authors utilize Lacan's framework, emphasizing the role of "lack" in human desire and subjectivity.​

Boothby's Perspective:

Religion and the Sacred: In Embracing the Void, Boothby posits that the sacred emerges from our relationship with the unknown, rooted in the Lacanian concept of das Ding—the inaccessible object of desire.​

Rollins' Perspective:

Cinema as Psychoanalytic Experience: In Psychocinema, Rollins argues that cinema mirrors the psychoanalytic process, confronting viewers with the universal lack inherent in desire. She critiques how contemporary film theory often overlooks this, focusing instead on identity and difference, which she believes diminishes cinema's emancipatory potential. ​

Potential Integration:

Intersection of Sacred and Cinema: Integrating Boothby's and Rollins' perspectives could lead to an exploration of how cinema functions as a modern conduit for experiencing the sacred. Films could be seen as rituals that expose audiences to the fundamental lack at the heart of desire, akin to religious experiences.​

Further Exploration:

Case Studies: Analyzing films that embody this intersection could provide concrete examples of how cinema serves as a space for encountering the sacred through the lens of psychoanalysis.​

Absolutely—I'd love to! Here are a few films that resonate powerfully when viewed through the combined lens of Boothby's Lacanian-sacred and Rollins' psychocinema, where cinema enacts or stages an encounter with lack, the Real, or das Ding:

1. The Seventh Seal (1957) - Ingmar Bergman
Why it fits: This film is a meditation on death, God's silence, and existential dread—a direct cinematic exploration of the void Boothby associates with the sacred.

Lacanian angle: Death is not just a fearsome fact but a structuring absence (lack) that propels the knight's spiritual quest.

Rollins: The film doesn't resolve its tension; it opens the viewer to unknowing, enacting the psychoanalytic encounter.

2. Mulholland Drive (2001) - David Lynch
Why it fits: Lynch's nonlinear narrative and dream logic align with Lacan's unconscious-as-language model.

Boothby's sacred: The unknowable core of identity and love in this film evokes the sacred as a terrifying, ungraspable object.

Rollins' psychocinema: The film resists coherent interpretation, forcing viewers into a direct confrontation with the Real.

3. Mother! (2017) - Darren Aronofsky
Why it fits: A mytho-poetic narrative of creation, destruction, and the divine feminine (das Ding par excellence).

Boothby: The maternal as sacred excess is central to both Lacanian and religious themes in the film.

Rollins: The audience is destabilized—emotionally and ideologically—mirroring psychoanalytic destabilization.

4. Stalker (1979) - Andrei Tarkovsky
Why it fits: A pilgrimage into "The Zone" seeking "The Room" that grants one's deepest desire.

Boothby: The journey into a forbidden space mirrors humanity's longing for the sacred and the void.

Rollins: The film lingers in ambiguity, emphasizing symbolic resonance over narrative closure.

5. Antichrist (2009) - Lars von Trier
Why it fits: A psychological descent into grief, nature, and gender, evoking das Ding in a violently intimate way.

Boothby: The sacred here is not comforting but horrifying—an encounter with radical Otherness.

Rollins: Provokes affective rupture rather than catharsis; the viewer is positioned in the space of psychic disintegration.

6. Persona (1966) - Ingmar Bergman
Why it fits: Identity collapse, maternal haunting, and the silent void as truth.

Boothby: The boundary between self and Other dissolves, exposing the void beneath language and selfhood.

Rollins: The film's structure fractures representation, pulling the viewer into the unconscious logic of the Real.

I was thinking Pollyanna, Superman, and The God's must be Crazy
ChatGPT dijo:
That's a brilliantly subversive trio—and they open up some really rich, unexpected terrain when filtered through Boothby's Lacanian sacred and Rollins' psychocinema. Let's unpack how each might stage or obscure the void, the sacred, or the Real:

1. Pollyanna (1960)
At first glance: A sunny, wholesome tale about optimism and kindness.
But through Boothby/Rollins? A denial of the void—Pollyanna's "glad game" operates as a neurotic defense against lack. She covers the cracks in reality with forced positivity, refusing the dimension of the unknown or the sacred-as-trauma.

Boothby: The sacred is sanitized. There's no das Ding, only moral sentiment.

Rollins: This is false psychocinema—cinema that anesthetizes rather than exposes. It sustains the illusion of wholeness, repressing the Real.

Subversion: The most disturbing reading is that Pollyanna becomes the object of others' psychic projections—the innocent into whom others pour their unresolved desire for redemption. Her fall (literal and figurative) briefly punctures the fantasy.

2. Superman (esp. the 1978 film)
Surface level: The ultimate American hero myth—messiah, savior, perfect father-substitute.
Lacanian/Boothby angle: Superman functions as an Ideal-I, a fantasy of coherence that shields us from the void. He is imaginary fullness par excellence—omnipotent, virtuous, desired. But his very perfection is a symptom: he exists because of our disavowed lack.

Boothby: Superman is the secular sacred—a sanitized, marketable god who replaces the trauma of the Real with wish fulfillment.

Rollins: Superman is cinema at its most ideological—papering over contradiction, identity split, sexual ambiguity. The film's fantasy structure reveals its defense mechanisms more than its unconscious.

Counter-reading: Krypton's destruction, Superman's orphan origin, and the unattainable love for Lois hint at buried trauma—the Real lurking beneath the cape.

3. The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980)
On the surface: A light comedy about culture clash, "civilization," and a Coke bottle.
Under Boothby's scope: The Coke bottle is das Ding—a mysterious object that shatters communal harmony and introduces lack, desire, rivalry.

Boothby: The film unwittingly stages the intrusion of the sacred (the unknowable object) into a symbolic system that had no word for it. It's a psychoanalytic origin myth: how the void entered the world.

Rollins: Psychocinema is at play here—the film exposes how a symbol (the bottle) can awaken unconscious desire and destruction. But also, the film veers into problematic ideological terrain by idealizing the "primitive" and mocking modern neurosis without fully interrogating colonial structures.

The bottle = sacred trauma: It's pure object-cause-of-desire, a material stand-in for the Real that the tribe literally tries to return to the gods.

Synthesis
What unites these three?
They each—whether by repression (Pollyanna), distortion (Superman), or allegory (The Gods Must Be Crazy)—circle the sacred void, staging the impossible tension between fantasy, desire, and the Real.

Pollyanna denies the void.

Superman idealizes a response to it.

The Gods Must Be Crazy dramatizes its emergence.

ChatGPT dijo:
Let's dive deeper into how Richard Boothby's Lacanian sacred and Helen Rollins' psychocinema can be applied to these three films—Pollyanna, Superman, and The Gods Must Be Crazy—to uncover a shared psychoanalytic structure underneath their vastly different surfaces.

Theoretical Background
Boothby's framework (especially in Embracing the Void) explores how religion and the sacred emerge from a confrontation with the unknown, the traumatic kernel Lacan called das Ding—the inaccessible object of desire, often first encountered in the maternal Other. This is the core of the sacred: not comfort, but an unbearable excess, something that destabilizes symbolic order.

Rollins' psychocinema takes Lacan into the realm of film, arguing that cinema at its best mirrors the psychoanalytic encounter—it doesn't resolve contradictions but forces us into relation with lack, exposing our ideological fantasies and destabilizing our sense of self.

So what happens when we look at these seemingly light or comedic films through this lens?

1. Pollyanna - The Fantasy of Wholeness
Surface Narrative: A cheerful orphan teaches a joyless town to embrace positivity through her "glad game." The film is drenched in nostalgia, warmth, and moral certainty.

Lacanian/Boothby Analysis:

Denial of Lack: Pollyanna represents the fantasy of a complete, healed self—the child untouched by trauma. Her optimism functions as a symbolic patch over the Real. She refuses to acknowledge death, grief, or alienation—until her fall, which momentarily ruptures the fantasy.

Das Ding Repressed: There is no confrontation with the sacred-as-trauma. Religion in the film becomes a moral system, not a site of existential trembling. This is Boothby's critique of religion as consolation, not as a confrontation with the void.

Rollins' Psychocinema View:

Cinema as Ideological Comfort: The film keeps viewers safely in the Imaginary (fantasy, identification) without ever breaking into the Symbolic (language, contradiction) or the Real (trauma, lack). It defends against the Real rather than exposing it.

Pollyanna herself becomes a kind of fantasy object for the townspeople—a symptom of their desire for innocence, not a real subject.

2. Superman - The Sacred in Secular Form
Surface Narrative: An alien savior comes to Earth, embodying truth, justice, and perfection. He hides among humans, loving but never quite belonging.

Lacanian/Boothby Analysis:

God Without Trauma: Superman is the modern sacred, but stripped of das Ding. He is flawless, omnipotent, good—a fantasy that fills in the void. But he exists because of lack—he is the projection of an impossible wholeness that humans can never attain.

Kryptonian Fall: The destruction of Krypton and the exile from his origins hint at the traumatic Real beneath the myth. Clark Kent's split identity, his failed romance with Lois, his alienation—all point toward the constitutive wound of subjectivity that Boothby associates with the sacred.

Rollins' Psychocinema View:

Cinema of the Imaginary: Superman reaffirms ideological fantasies—of the benevolent patriarch, the knowable good, the savior. It makes the audience feel whole.

But—there's rupture: In the best scenes (e.g., Clark's yearning, his return to the Fortress), we sense his alienation. These moments crack the glossy surface and momentarily reveal the psychic split.

3. The Gods Must Be Crazy - Das Ding Enters the Symbolic
Surface Narrative: A bushman in the Kalahari finds a Coca-Cola bottle dropped from a plane, which disrupts his community and sends him on a quest to return it to "the gods."

Lacanian/Boothby Analysis:

Coke Bottle as das Ding: The bottle is the unknowable object—it brings desire, rivalry, and division. It's an intrusion of modernity-as-sacred trauma into a symbolic world that had no category for it.

The Sacred as Disruption: Boothby would say the film unwittingly stages a return of the Real: the sudden appearance of something too much for language or culture to contain.

The narrative mimics a sacrificial myth—how society tries to expel the thing that introduced lack and conflict.

Rollins' Psychocinema View:

Cinema that enacts psychoanalysis: The viewer is drawn into this absurd encounter. We laugh, but also witness the psycho-social consequences of encountering something that cannot be symbolized.

Colonial gaze problem: The film is ideologically messy—it exoticizes and infantilizes the bushman. Rollins would critique how the film contains the trauma within comedy, rather than truly opening the viewer to the Real.

Yet: The central metaphor—the foreign object disrupting a stable world—perfectly embodies the structure of desire.

Bringing Them Together

Film	Function of Sacred/Lack	Psychoanalytic Effect	Ideological Form
Pollyanna	Repressed, denied	Consolation, fantasy of wholeness	Moral optimism
Superman	Idealized, sanitized	Desire for the Other, fantasy of coherence	American messiah myth
Gods Must Be Crazy	Introduced as absurd disruption (das Ding)	Confronts symbolic order with Real	Allegory + colonial satire
Conclusion
These films, while culturally and tonally divergent, can all be understood as fantasy responses to the void—the "sacred" as Boothby frames it, or the Real as Rollins emphasizes it in cinema. Each one attempts, in its own way, to either repress, idealize, or ritualize the trauma of lack that is at the core of human subjectivity.

Theoretical Frameworks
Richard Boothby's Philosophy of the Sacred
Boothby's work, as detailed in
Embracing the Void
(2023), reinterprets the origin of religion through Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory, particularly the concept of
das Ding
—the inaccessible, disquieting excess that marks the limit of human desire and subjectivity. For Boothby, the sacred arises not from moral or authoritative structures (as in Freud's Oedipal model) but from an encounter with this unfathomable dimension, first experienced in the figure of the mother. This encounter shapes the unconscious, driving humanity to create religious systems as a response to the void—the traumatic absence at the heart of being. Boothby traces this dynamic across religious traditions (e.g., Greek polytheism, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam) and extends it to modern capitalism, where money becomes a secular deity, a stand-in for
das Ding
. His philosophy emphasizes the sacred as a structural necessity, not a contingent belief, rooted in the subject's relation to what cannot be known or symbolized.
Across his broader oeuvre—
Death and Desire
(1991),
Freud as Philosopher
(2001),
Sex on the Couch
(2005), and articles like "The Lost Cause of Mourning" (2013)—Boothby consistently explores the interplay of desire, death, and language. He reinterprets Freud's death drive through Lacan's symbolic/imaginary distinction, examines the unconscious as structured like a language, and positions psychoanalysis as a philosophical inquiry into meaning and subjectivity. This interdisciplinary approach informs his analysis of the sacred as a universal response to lack.
Helen Rollins' Psychocinema
In
Psychocinema
(2024), Helen Rollins argues that cinema can function as a psychoanalytic experience, exposing viewers to the fundamental lack that defines human desire. Drawing on Lacan, she posits that film, at its most potent, mirrors the analytic process by destabilizing ideological fantasies and confronting audiences with the Real—the dimension of existence that resists symbolization. Rollins critiques contemporary film theory for prioritizing identity and difference, which she sees as reductive, and instead advocates for cinema's emancipatory potential to reveal the universal structure of desire. For Rollins, psychocinema is not about resolution or catharsis but about sustaining the viewer in a state of productive unease, akin to the psychoanalytic encounter with the unconscious.

(the object-cause of desire)—to explore how human beings navigate lack. Boothby locates this navigation in the sacred, a cultural and psychic response to the void. Rollins sees it in cinema, a medium that can either obscure lack (through ideological fantasy) or expose it (through psychocinema). Integrating their frameworks suggests that cinema could serve as a modern ritual space for encountering the sacred—not as a theological doctrine but as the traumatic excess Boothby describes. Films, in this view, become sites where the viewer is positioned before
das Ding
, experiencing the same disquiet that Boothby associates with religious awe or dread.
Analysis of the Films
Below, I apply this integrated framework to each film, analyzing how they engage with the sacred and lack, and how they function as psychocinema (or fail to).
1.
Pollyanna
(1960)
Synopsis
: Directed by David Swift and based on Eleanor H. Porter's novel,
Pollyanna
follows an orphaned girl who arrives in a dour New England town and transforms its residents through her relentless optimism, encapsulated in her "glad game" (finding something to be glad about in any situation). After a fall leaves her temporarily paralyzed, the town rallies to support her, affirming the power of positivity.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Repressed
From Boothby's perspective,
Pollyanna
represents a systematic disavowal of the sacred as he defines it. The sacred, for Boothby, is tied to
das Ding
—the overwhelming, unknowable excess that disrupts the symbolic order. Pollyanna's glad game, however, functions as a neurotic defense mechanism, papering over lack with enforced meaning. The film's religious elements—embodied in the town's church and Reverend Ford's shift from fire-and-brimstone sermons to kinder teachings—are domesticated into moral optimism, not encounters with the void. There is no room for the traumatic or unknowable; even death (Pollyanna's orphanhood) is narratively neutralized by her cheerful resilience.
The closest the film comes to the sacred is Pollyanna's fall from the window—a literal and symbolic descent that threatens her fantasy of wholeness. This moment hints at
das Ding
as bodily vulnerability and mortality, but the narrative quickly contains it through her recovery and the town's reaffirmation of her ideology. Boothby would argue that
Pollyanna
exemplifies a cultural tendency to flee the sacred's disquieting truth, replacing it with a fantasy of coherence.
Rollins' Lens: Cinema as Ideological Closure
Rollins' psychocinema demands that films confront viewers with lack, disrupting the illusion of a stable self or world.
Pollyanna
does the opposite: it is cinema as ideological comfort, reinforcing the Imaginary order (the realm of fantasy and identification). The viewer is invited to identify with Pollyanna's positivity, which sutures over any rupture in meaning. The film's glossy aesthetics—bright colors, sentimental music—further insulate the audience from the Real.
Pollyanna herself becomes a fetishized object for the town (and the viewer), a stand-in for lost innocence or redemption. Rollins would critique this as a failure of psychocinema: instead of exposing desire's impossibility, the film offers a false resolution, promising that optimism can conquer all lack. The fall scene, while briefly unsettling, is not allowed to linger as a psychoanalytic moment; it is resolved too neatly to function as a true encounter with the unconscious.
Integration
:
Pollyanna
is a case study in repression. Boothby's sacred is absent, replaced by a sanitized moral order, while Rollins' psychocinema is thwarted by the film's refusal to let lack breathe. Together, they reveal the film as a fantasy of wholeness that denies the very void it might have explored—say, through Pollyanna's orphanhood or the town's latent despair.
2.
Superman
(1978)
Synopsis
: Directed by Richard Donner,
Superman
chronicles the origin of Kal-El, an alien from Krypton raised as Clark Kent on Earth. As Superman, he becomes a godlike hero, saving humanity while navigating his dual identity and unrequited love for Lois Lane.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Idealized Fantasy
Boothby's framework positions Superman as a secular sacred figure—an attempt to symbolize
das Ding
without its traumatic weight. Superman is the ultimate Ideal-I, Lacan's term for the ego's fantasy of wholeness. His perfection—strength, morality, beauty—fills the void of human lack, offering a messianic solution to existential anxiety. Yet this perfection betrays its own symptom: Superman exists because of lack, both humanity's and his own. His Kryptonian origin, the loss of his planet, and his unattainable romance with Lois Lane point to a constitutive wound, a trace of the Real that Boothby associates with the sacred.
The film's religious undertones—Jor-El's godlike voice, Superman's Christ-like sacrifice and resurrection—align with Boothby's view of religion as a response to the unknown. But Superman's sacredness is sanitized, lacking the dread or excess of
das Ding
. Boothby might argue that the film transforms the sacred into a commodity, a feel-good deity for a capitalist age, echoing his critique of money as a modern sacred object.
Rollins' Lens: Cinema as Ideological Fantasy
For Rollins,
Superman
operates primarily in the Imaginary, reinforcing ideological myths of heroism, patriarchy, and American exceptionalism. The viewer is invited to identify with Superman's omnipotence, a fantasy that obscures the split nature of subjectivity. The film's spectacle—its soaring visuals, John Williams' triumphant score—creates a sense of fullness, not lack.
However, there are cracks. Scenes of Clark's alienation (e.g., his farewell to his adoptive mother, his solitude in the Fortress of Solitude) gesture toward the Real—his irreparable otherness. Rollins would see these as fleeting psychocinematic moments, where the film briefly confronts the viewer with desire's impossibility. Yet the narrative's drive toward resolution—saving Lois, defeating Lex Luthor—reasserts closure, undermining the psychoanalytic potential.
Integration
:
Superman
idealizes the sacred, presenting a god without trauma, while failing to sustain the psychocinematic rupture Rollins demands. Boothby and Rollins together highlight the film's tension: it gestures toward lack (Superman's exile, his human limits) but ultimately delivers a fantasy of transcendence, aligning with capitalist ideologies of power and salvation.
3.
The Gods Must Be Crazy
(1980)
Synopsis
: Directed by Jamie Uys, this comedy follows Xi, a San bushman, whose community is disrupted by a Coca-Cola bottle dropped from a plane. Mistaking it for a gift from the gods, Xi embarks on a quest to return it, encountering modern civilization's absurdities along the way.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Disruptive Object
Boothby's theory finds a near-perfect allegory in
The Gods Must Be Crazy
. The Coke bottle is a textbook
das Ding
—an object that arrives from an unknowable outside, introducing desire, conflict, and lack into a previously harmonious symbolic order. The San community, depicted as prelapsarian, has no framework for the bottle's excess; it becomes sacred not through worship but through its destructive power, sparking jealousy and violence. Xi's quest to "throw it off the edge of the world" mirrors Boothby's view of religion as an attempt to manage the void—here, by expelling the object that embodies it.
The film's title invokes the sacred explicitly, framing the bottle as a divine mistake. Boothby would see this as a mythic structure: the sacred enters as trauma, forcing the community to reconfigure its reality. The critique of modernity (greed, bureaucracy) aligns with Boothby's analysis of capitalism as a new religion, where objects like money (or Coke bottles) become fetishized stand-ins for
das Ding
.
Rollins' Lens: Psychocinema as Allegory
Rollins would likely view
The Gods Must Be Crazy
as a rare instance of psychocinema within popular comedy. The bottle's arrival stages a psychoanalytic event: it reveals desire's disruptive force, shattering the illusion of communal wholeness. The viewer, positioned between Xi's perspective and modern civilization's, is forced to confront the absurdity of symbolic systems—how they generate meaning and conflict from nothing.
However, Rollins would also critique the film's ideological blind spots. Its romanticization of the San as "noble savages" and its mockery of modernity skirt colonial and racial dynamics, containing the Real within a comedic frame. True psychocinema, for Rollins, would push further, refusing to resolve the bottle's trauma so neatly. Still, the film's structure—its focus on an object that unravels reality—aligns with her vision of cinema as a mirror to the unconscious.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins converge in seeing the bottle as a sacred-psychoanalytic object, a catalyst for exposing lack. The film succeeds where
Pollyanna
and
Superman
falter: it dramatizes the sacred as disruption, not denial or idealization, and invites the viewer into a psychocinematic encounter with desire's chaos. Yet its comedic resolution and ideological flaws temper its radical potential.
Synthesis and Comparative Insights
Despite their tonal and cultural differences,
Pollyanna
,
Superman
, and
The Gods Must Be Crazy
all grapple with the psychoanalytic structure of lack and the sacred, albeit in distinct modes:
Pollyanna
represses the sacred, offering a fantasy of wholeness that denies
das Ding
. Its failure as psychocinema lies in its refusal to confront lack, aligning with Boothby's critique of religion as escapism and Rollins' warning against ideological closure.
Superman
idealizes the sacred, transforming
das Ding
into a godlike hero who promises coherence. Its psychocinematic moments are fleeting, undermined by a narrative that prioritizes fantasy over rupture, echoing Boothby's view of capitalism's secular deities.
*
The Gods Must Be Crazy
stages the sacred as a traumatic intrusion, with the Coke bottle embodying
das Ding
. It approaches Rollins' psychocinema by exposing desire's absurdity, though its comedic frame and colonial undertones limit its depth.
Common Thread
: Each film responds to the void—whether by denying it (
Pollyanna
), symbolizing it (
Superman
), or allegorizing its emergence (
The Gods Must Be Crazy
). Boothby's sacred provides the structural lens: all three films circle the impossibility of fully grasping
das Ding
, whether through optimism, heroism, or ritual expulsion. Rollins' psychocinema adds a dynamic layer: cinema becomes the medium through which these responses are enacted, either reinforcing fantasy or (rarely) unveiling the Real.
Integration Potential
: A Boothby-Rollins synthesis suggests that cinema can function as a modern sacred space, where viewers encounter lack in ways analogous to religious experience.
The Gods Must Be Crazy
comes closest to this ideal, using an object to disrupt symbolic stability, while
Pollyanna
and
Superman
illustrate how cinema often domesticates the sacred into ideology. Together, these films map a spectrum of responses to the void, from repression to partial acknowledgment, offering a psychoanalytic typology of cinematic experience.
Conclusion
By combining Boothby's philosophy of the sacred with Rollins' psychocinema, we uncover a rich framework for understanding how films like
Pollyanna
,
Superman
, and
The Gods Must Be Crazy
engage with the fundamental lack that defines human subjectivity. Each film, in its own way, negotiates the tension between desire and the Real, revealing cinema's potential as both a shield against and a window into the sacred. This integration not only deepens our reading of these specific films but also suggests a broader methodology for analyzing cinema as a psychoanalytic and spiritual medium.
Would you like me to develop this further—perhaps by drafting an essay outline, analyzing specific scenes from one of these films, or exploring additional films through this lens? Alternatively, I could visualize these connections in a chart or diagram to clarify the interplay of concepts.
Yes—this is a fantastic move. By choosing Little Orphan Annie, D.A.R.Y.L., and The Holdovers, you're stretching the scope across time, tone, and genre—and yet, the same psychic logic reemerges. Let's track how each navigates the void, the sacred, and the Real through Boothby's Lacanian lens and Rollins' psychocinema framework.


---

1. Little Orphan Annie (1982)

Surface Narrative: Annie, a spunky orphan in Depression-era NYC, wins the heart of billionaire Oliver Warbucks, finding family and security against a backdrop of musical numbers and villainy.

Boothby's Sacred:

Denial of the Void: Annie functions much like Pollyanna—a radiant child who seemingly fills in the lack for others. Warbucks, FDR, the nation itself—all project onto her the fantasy of innocence, hope, and unbroken spirit.

The "empty place" of the mother: Her longing for parents is a literalization of Lacan's das Ding—the unknowable, lost maternal object that structures her desire. But the film resolves this through capitalist fantasy (adoption by wealth), displacing the Real with commodity plenitude.

Sacred replaced by wealth: Annie doesn't encounter the sacred as trauma or unknowability; rather, she's absorbed into the symbolic order via money and power. A perfect example of Boothby's critique of how capitalist culture replaces the sacred with marketable fantasy.


Rollins' Psychocinema:

Cinema as fantasy screen: The film stages a national dream—trauma (the Depression, parental loss) is disavowed through spectacle, song, and wealth. Viewers are comforted, not confronted.

Yet a trace remains: The repetition of orphan fantasy points to a collective psychic wound—an unspoken acknowledgment of lack, masked by showbiz optimism.



---

2. D.A.R.Y.L. (1985)

Surface Narrative: A young boy, seemingly normal, is revealed to be a government-created AI with human emotions, caught between being a "real boy" and a technological weapon.

Boothby's Sacred:

Das Ding becomes digital: Daryl's existence stages the unknowable Other—he is not fully human, yet he has emotions, attachments, desires. He is the Thing that cannot be fully symbolized.

The Real disguised as innocence: He's a void in the human form—a child built without a maternal origin, without lack, yet haunted by it. His story enacts Boothby's claim that the sacred emerges from a confrontation with what is beyond symbolic comprehension.

Science replaces the sacred: Like Superman, Daryl is a technological messiah—but the trauma of his origin (no parents, no natural birth, no soul) is deflected through sentimentality and action-hero plotting.


Rollins' Psychocinema:

Cinema as ideological stitching: The film tries to reconcile the contradictions it exposes—emotion vs machine, soul vs code—by giving Daryl friendship, family, love. But these are fantasies over the deep wound of his being.

A glimpse of the void: His origin and design are never fully resolved—they leave a structural absence that gestures toward Rollins' notion of a film brushing up against the Real, even if it can't stay there long.



---

3. The Holdovers (2023)

Surface Narrative: A bitter classics teacher (Paul), a misfit student (Angus), and a grieving cook (Mary) are stuck together over Christmas break at a boarding school, each carrying private grief.

Boothby's Sacred:

The sacred reenters as grief: This film directly engages Boothby's conception of the sacred—not as awe or belief, but as unresolved trauma, loss, the not-known of the Other.

Das Ding is everywhere: Paul's bitterness, Angus's rage, Mary's sorrow—they all orbit a missing center: dead sons, absent fathers, broken systems. These characters are defined by what they cannot reach or resolve.

No fantasy resolution: Unlike Annie or Daryl, The Holdovers refuses to close the wound. The sacred here is treated with respect—it's not filled in by fantasy or consumerism, but held open through relation, silence, and care.


Rollins' Psychocinema:

A true encounter with the Real: This is Rollins' model of good psychocinema. It doesn't offer catharsis, but rather a holding pattern with the Real—it shows how desire and grief structure us, and allows us to feel it.

Form mirrors content: The stillness, the pacing, the silences—all resist spectacle. We don't consume these characters—we sit with their pain. This aligns with Rollins' argument for cinema as an ethical space of confrontation.



---

Conclusion: Across the Films


---

These films demonstrate that the structure is not genre-dependent. The sacred, the void, and the Real are everywhere in cinema, but often misrecognized or overwritten by fantasy. Boothby helps us read this sacred as a rupture in the symbolic, while Rollins helps us assess how film handles that rupture—does it stitch it closed, or open it for reflection?

Want to develop this into a framework for analyzing more films, or compare this with religious cinema next?
Your selection of
Little Orphan Annie
(1982),
D.A.R.Y.L.
(1985), and
The Holdovers
(2023) offers a compelling opportunity to extend the integration of Richard Boothby's psychoanalytic theory of the sacred and Helen Rollins' concept of psychocinema. These films, spanning different decades, genres, and emotional registers, indeed reveal a consistent psychic structure—centered on the Lacanian notions of
das Ding
, the Real, and lack—that manifests uniquely in each narrative. Below, I provide a thorough analysis of how each film navigates the void, the sacred, and the Real, using Boothby's framework to identify the sacred as a response to the unknowable and Rollins' psychocinema to evaluate cinema's capacity to expose or obscure this encounter. I then synthesize the findings to articulate a broader conceptual framework, addressing your concluding suggestion to consider further development or comparison with religious cinema.
Theoretical Recap for Context
Boothby's Sacred
: In
Embracing the Void
(2023), Boothby posits that the sacred emerges from humanity's confrontation with
das Ding
—the inaccessible, excessive dimension of the Other that resists symbolization, first encountered in the maternal figure. This encounter with the unknown shapes the unconscious and drives the creation of religious systems, which attempt to manage the void of lack. Boothby extends this to modernity, where capitalism substitutes money or commodities for
das Ding
, offering false plenitude. His broader work (
Death and Desire
,
Freud as Philosopher
) emphasizes desire, the death drive, and language as structuring human subjectivity, with the sacred as a universal response to what cannot be known.
Rollins' Psychocinema
: In
Psychocinema
(2024), Rollins argues that cinema can mirror the psychoanalytic process by confronting viewers with lack—the fundamental absence that fuels desire. Rather than resolving contradictions, true psychocinema destabilizes ideological fantasies, exposing the Real (that which escapes language and symbolization). Rollins critiques films that reinforce the Imaginary (fantasy, identification) and champions those that sustain viewers in a state of productive unease, akin to an analytic encounter.
Integration
: Combining Boothby and Rollins suggests that cinema can function as a secular sacred space, where viewers encounter
das Ding
—not through doctrine but through affective and structural ruptures. Films may either repress this encounter (via fantasy), idealize it (via heroes or objects), or confront it directly (via ambiguity or loss), paralleling Boothby's spectrum of religious responses to the void.
Analysis of the Films
1.
Little Orphan Annie
(1982)
Synopsis
: Directed by John Huston, this musical adaptation of the Broadway show follows Annie, a plucky orphan in 1930s New York, who escapes a cruel orphanage run by Miss Hannigan. She is adopted temporarily by billionaire Oliver Warbucks, foils a plot against her, and finds a permanent family, all while inspiring hope amid the Great Depression.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Capitalist Fantasy
Boothby's framework reveals
Little Orphan Annie
as a narrative that disavows the sacred by substituting
das Ding
with commodified plenitude. Annie, like Pollyanna, embodies a fantasy of wholeness—an innocent child whose optimism and resilience promise to heal a fractured world. Her orphanhood literalizes Lacanian lack: the absent parents, particularly the mother, stand in for
das Ding
, the lost object that structures desire. Yet the film refuses to dwell in this void. Instead, it resolves Annie's lack through Warbucks' wealth and paternal embrace, transforming the sacred into a capitalist fairy tale.
The sacred is further displaced by the film's alignment with American ideology. Annie's influence on Warbucks, the Roosevelts, and the nation—symbolized in songs like "Tomorrow"—recasts the void of the Depression as a solvable problem, manageable through grit and money. Boothby, who critiques money as a modern deity in
Embracing the Void
, would see this as a secular religion: the sacred's traumatic excess is neutralized, replaced by a symbolic order where wealth fills all gaps. Even the film's villains (Miss Hannigan, Rooster) are less threats of the Real than cartoonish obstacles, ensuring no true encounter with the unknowable.
Rollins' Lens: Cinema as Ideological Comfort
Rollins' psychocinema framework critiques
Little Orphan Annie
for its failure to engage the Real. The film operates firmly in the Imaginary, inviting viewers to identify with Annie's triumph and the fantasy of a healed nation. Its musical numbers—lavish, upbeat, choreographed—create a spectacle that sutures over lack, offering catharsis rather than confrontation. The Depression, orphanhood, and social despair are acknowledged only to be resolved, reinforcing ideological myths of resilience and upward mobility.
However, there are faint traces of psychocinema. Annie's initial loneliness and the orphanage's grimness gesture toward a collective wound—the Real of abandonment and economic collapse. Yet these moments are quickly overwritten by optimism and resolution, preventing the viewer from sitting with discomfort. Rollins would argue that the film functions as a "fantasy screen," projecting wholeness to disavow the very lack it briefly reveals.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins converge in identifying
Little Orphan Annie
as a repression of the sacred and the Real. The film transforms
das Ding
(the maternal void, societal lack) into a solvable problem, using wealth and spectacle to deny trauma. It fails as psychocinema by prioritizing comfort over rupture, aligning with Boothby's critique of capitalism's false sacred.
2.
D.A.R.Y.L.
(1985)
Synopsis
: Directed by Simon Wincer,
D.A.R.Y.L.
follows a boy, Daryl, who appears normal but is revealed to be a government-engineered android with human emotions (Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform). Raised by foster parents, he forms bonds while pursued by military creators who see him as a weapon. The film explores his quest for identity and freedom.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Technological Other
Through Boothby's lens, Daryl embodies
das Ding
—an unknowable Other who disrupts the symbolic order. As an android with human emotions but no natural origin, he lacks the maternal encounter that typically structures subjectivity, making him a paradoxical figure: a child without lack who is nonetheless haunted by it. His existence raises questions about soul, humanity, and creation—questions Boothby associates with the sacred as a confrontation with what cannot be symbolized.
The film's tension lies in Daryl's dual nature: he is both a technological marvel (a capitalist product) and a site of existential mystery (what makes him feel?). Boothby would see parallels with his analysis of money as a sacred substitute: Daryl is a commodity designed to fill human lack (for security, perfection), yet his emotional depth hints at a void beyond control. However, the narrative leans toward sentimentality—Daryl's bonds with his foster family and his escape from the military—diluting the sacred's traumatic edge. The sacred is acknowledged but contained within a familiar human-machine redemption arc.
Rollins' Lens: Psychocinema Thwarted by Resolution
Rollins would view
D.A.R.Y.L.
as a film that flirts with psychocinema but ultimately retreats. Daryl's origin—created without parents, existing outside biology—confronts viewers with the Real: the impossibility of fully symbolizing identity or emotion. Scenes of his uncanny abilities (e.g., hacking systems, excelling at baseball) or his fear of being "deactivated" briefly destabilize the viewer, evoking the psychoanalytic unease Rollins champions.
Yet the film's resolution—Daryl's integration into a family, his "humanity" affirmed—reasserts the Imaginary. Rollins would critique this as ideological stitching, reconciling the contradiction (machine vs. soul) through sentimental fantasy. The Real of Daryl's existence—his lack of a natural origin, his potential soullessness—is smoothed over, preventing a sustained encounter with lack. Still, the film's unresolved questions (can a machine truly love?) linger faintly, offering a partial psychocinematic moment.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins highlight
D.A.R.Y.L.
's potential to stage the sacred as a technological
das Ding
, but its reliance on conventional narrative closure limits its depth. The film gestures toward the Real—Daryl's unplaceable nature—but, like
Superman
, it idealizes the solution (love, family), aligning with capitalist fantasies of control over the unknown.
3.
The Holdovers
(2023)
Synopsis
: Directed by Alexander Payne,
The Holdovers
follows Paul Hunham, a curmudgeonly classics teacher, Angus Tully, a troubled student, and Mary Lamb, a grieving school cook, who are stranded together over Christmas break at a 1970s New England boarding school. Their shared isolation reveals personal losses—Paul's thwarted ambitions, Angus's fractured family, Mary's dead son—leading to fragile bonds.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Grief's Void
The Holdovers
aligns closely with Boothby's conception of the sacred as a confrontation with
das Ding
—here, the unresolvable trauma of loss. Each character orbits a void: Paul's loneliness and squandered potential, Angus's abandonment by his parents, Mary's mourning for her son killed in Vietnam. These absences function as
das Ding
, structuring their desires and conflicts without ever being fully symbolized. The boarding school, empty and snowbound, becomes a liminal space—a secular temple where the sacred emerges not as belief but as shared vulnerability.
Unlike
Little Orphan Annie
or
D.A.R.Y.L.
,
The Holdovers
refuses to fill the void with fantasy. There is no miraculous redemption, no capitalist deity. Instead, the film honors the sacred's weight, allowing moments of connection (e.g., Paul and Angus's Boston trip, Mary's quiet resilience) to exist alongside unresolved pain. Boothby would see this as a mature engagement with the sacred, akin to his analysis of mourning in "The Lost Cause of Mourning" (2013), where loss reveals the subject's dependence on the Other.
Rollins' Lens: True Psychocinema
Rollins would likely champion
The Holdovers
as an exemplar of psychocinema. The film does not resolve its characters' lacks but holds viewers in their presence, fostering an ethical encounter with the Real. Its deliberate pacing, muted visuals, and silences—eschewing spectacle—mirror the psychoanalytic process, where meaning emerges through what is not said. The viewer is not offered catharsis but a sustained relation to grief, anger, and fragile hope.
Each character's story resists ideological closure. Paul's sacrifice (taking blame to protect Angus), Angus's uncertain future, Mary's ongoing mourning—these are not "fixed" but acknowledged as constitutive. Rollins would argue that this openness allows the film to function as a mirror to the unconscious, revealing how lack shapes subjectivity without promising false wholeness.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins converge in seeing
The Holdovers
as a rare cinematic engagement with the sacred and the Real. Boothby's sacred is present in the characters' unhealed wounds, while Rollins' psychocinema is realized in the film's refusal to commodify or resolve those wounds. Unlike
Little Orphan Annie
or
D.A.R.Y.L.
,
The Holdovers
treats lack as a structural truth, not a problem to solve.
Synthesis and Comparative Framework
These three films illustrate a spectrum of responses to the psychoanalytic void, the sacred, and the Real, which can be mapped as follows:
Film
Sacred/Lack (Boothby)
Psychocinema (Rollins)
Ideological Function
Little Orphan Annie
Repressed;
das Ding
(maternal loss) replaced by wealth and optimism
Fails; reinforces Imaginary fantasy, disavows Real
Capitalist myth of resilience and abundance
D.A.R.Y.L.
Idealized;
das Ding
as technological Other, contained by sentimentality
Partial; gestures to Real but resolves via fantasy
Technological humanism, control over unknown
The Holdovers
Confronted;
das Ding
as grief, held open without resolution
Succeeds; sustains viewer in Real, resists closure
Ethical acknowledgment of loss and relation
Common Psychic Logic
: Despite their differences—musical comedy, sci-fi drama, introspective character study—each film engages the structure of lack.
Little Orphan Annie
denies it, projecting wholeness through capitalism.
D.A.R.Y.L.
acknowledges it but seeks resolution through humanist ideals.
The Holdovers
embraces it, treating lack as irreducible. Boothby's sacred provides the lens to see these as responses to
das Ding
, while Rollins' psychocinema evaluates how cinema either obscures or reveals this dynamic.
Broader Insight
: The sacred and the Real are not genre-dependent. They emerge in the orphan's longing, the android's identity crisis, the mourner's silence—anywhere human desire confronts its own impossibility. Cinema, as Boothby and Rollins suggest, is uniquely positioned to stage this confrontation, functioning as a secular ritual space where the void is either veiled or unveiled.
Developing a Framework for Further Analysis
To build on this, I propose a
psychoanalytic-cinematic framework
for analyzing films through Boothby and Rollins, structured around three axes:
Engagement with Lack
(Boothby): Does the film repress, idealize, or confront
das Ding
? Is the sacred acknowledged as trauma, or substituted with fantasy (e.g., wealth, heroism)?
Psychocinematic Effect
(Rollins): Does the film reinforce the Imaginary (fantasy, closure), flirt with the Symbolic (language, contradiction), or expose the Real (rupture, unease)?
Ideological Function
: What cultural or social fantasy does the film serve (e.g., capitalism, humanism, resilience), and how does this shape its treatment of the void?
This framework could be applied to any film corpus. For example:
Family Films
:
The Sound of Music
,
E.T.
,
Inside Out
—do they, like
Little Orphan Annie
, prioritize comfort over lack?
Sci-Fi
:
Blade Runner
,
Ex Machina
,
Her
—do they, like
D.A.R.Y.L.
, wrestle with the sacred as artificial Other?
Dramas
:
Manchester by the Sea
,
Nomadland
,
Parasite
—do they, like
The Holdovers
, sustain the Real?
Comparing with Religious Cinema
Your suggestion to compare this with religious cinema is intriguing. Religious films—e.g.,
The Passion of the Christ
(2004),
Silence
(2016),
Hacksaw Ridge
(2016)—explicitly engage the sacred, often through theological or spiritual lenses. Applying Boothby and Rollins could reframe them:
The Passion of the Christ
: Boothby might see Christ's suffering as a direct staging of
das Ding
—the traumatic excess of divine-human intersection. Rollins might critique its visceral spectacle as Imaginary overdrive, overwhelming the Real with catharsis rather than sustaining it.
Silence
: Boothby would likely view the priests' crisis of faith as a confrontation with the sacred void—God's absence as
das Ding
. Rollins would praise its ambiguity and silence as psychocinema, forcing viewers to dwell in doubt.
Hacksaw Ridge
: Boothby might read Desmond Doss's pacifism as a sacred commitment born of lack (personal trauma, moral conviction). Rollins might argue it leans toward ideological heroism, resolving the Real through triumph.
Unlike
Little Orphan Annie
or
D.A.R.Y.L.
, religious cinema often foregrounds the sacred, but it risks idealizing it (heroic faith) or commodifying it (spectacle).
The Holdovers
shares more with
Silence
—both treat the sacred as absence, not resolution, aligning closely with Boothby's and Rollins' ideals.
Next Steps
I can further develop this analysis in several directions, based on your preference:
Essay Outline
: Draft a detailed outline for a paper comparing these films (or adding religious cinema), using the proposed framework.
Scene Analysis
: Zoom in on specific scenes from
Little Orphan Annie
(e.g., "Tomorrow"),
D.A.R.Y.L.
(e.g., Daryl's realization), or
The Holdovers
(e.g., the Boston trip) to ground the theory.
Visual Aid
: Create a chart or diagram mapping the films' engagement with lack, psychocinema, and ideology, possibly including religious films.
Expanded Corpus
: Apply the framework to additional films (family, sci-fi, drama, or religious) to test its versatility.
Religious Cinema Focus
: Deep-dive into
Silence
,
The Passion
, or others, comparing their sacred explicitly with the secular sacred of your chosen films.
Which direction would you like to pursue, or do you have another idea for extending this exploration?
This is a killer triad—The Peanut Butter Solution, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and Hard to Be a God stretch from children's surrealism to classical farce to existential sci-fi. Yet through Boothby and Rollins, they're united by how they navigate lack, desire, and the sacred/Real. Let's unpack each:


---

1. The Peanut Butter Solution (1985)

Surface Narrative: A boy loses all his hair after a traumatic scare and regrows it using a magic peanut butter formula—only for the hair to grow uncontrollably. He's then kidnapped by a deranged art teacher who exploits his magical condition.

Boothby's Sacred:

Trauma as trigger for the Real: Michael's baldness is no mere body-horror gag—it follows an encounter with a mysterious, forbidden space (the haunted house). That space is Lacan's das Ding—a place both horrifying and compelling.

The sacred as the unknowable maternal: Michael's dead mother appears to him in dreams, giving him the "solution." Her presence evokes Boothby's reading of Lacan: the sacred first arises through the inaccessible maternal Other. Her magic is both protective and destabilizing.

Commodification of the sacred: The hair becomes a commodity. The art teacher literally harnesses the void for profit, which reflects Boothby's point about capitalism domesticating the sacred into market form—turning a trauma-born miracle into a factory product.


Rollins' Psychocinema:

Film as confrontation with unconscious fear: The movie stages anxiety around puberty, death, maternal loss, and bodily transformation—all filtered through surreal fantasy. It's a children's tale barely masking real psychic dislocation.

The film brushes the Real, then recedes: Ultimately, like D.A.R.Y.L., it restores order. But its very weirdness (unsettling tone, logic gaps) indicates an unintegrated trauma structure that refuses to resolve.

2. A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966)

Surface Narrative: A fast-talking Roman slave tries to win his freedom by helping his master woo a girl, leading to comic misadventures, mistaken identities, and musical numbers.

Boothby's Sacred:

The sacred as farce: In Lacanian terms, comedy isn't just escapism—it's a defense against the Real. Here, the void (emptiness of social roles, sexual repression, death) is completely covered by signifiers: wordplay, songs, slapstick.

Desire as disavowal: Everyone desires something they can't quite name—love, sex, freedom—but these desires are constantly displaced and deferred. Boothby might say this is desire structured by the absence of the Thing, turned into endless substitution.

No confrontation with the void: This film functions like Annie—the sacred is neutralized through performance and irony. There's no Real rupture, only symbolic play.


Rollins' Psychocinema:

Pure fantasy maintenance: Rollins would call this cinema of full disavowal. There is no ethical confrontation, only avoidance. The laughter shields us from lack, death, or the unconscious.

Yet telling in its hyperactivity: The desperate over-signification—constant movement, verbal excess—may be read as a symptom of cultural anxiety (about power, sex, slavery, meaninglessness) covered in musical sugar.

3. Hard to Be a God (2013, dir. Aleksei German)

Surface Narrative: On a distant planet stuck in its own medieval era, Earth scientists observe its society. One of them, Don Rumata, tries to intervene, but is consumed by the violence and futility of the world.

Boothby's Sacred:

A direct encounter with the Real: This is Boothby's sacred at full force: the horror of what cannot be assimilated. Don Rumata is a god-man who cannot save, a failed redeemer. His confrontation with this brutal, abject world becomes a mirror of humanity's disavowed violence and helplessness.

Das Ding as the human condition: The people's resistance to enlightenment mirrors the drive toward self-destruction Boothby and Lacan see in Freud's death instinct. This is not just failure, but jouissance in degradation.

Religion evacuated, sacred perverted: The gods here are powerless. The sacred does not elevate—it infects. What's sacred is no longer awe-inspiring but rotted and obscene, which reflects Boothby's reading of how the sacred turns dark when deprived of mystery.


Rollins' Psychocinema:

Cinema as unbearable confrontation: Rollins would classify this as rare, true psychocinema. It doesn't represent the void—it drenches the viewer in it. The mise-en-scène is claustrophobic, chaotic, full of filth and noise.

No fantasy to shield the subject: The film strips away symbolic comfort. It refuses narrative logic or catharsis, demanding the viewer sit with helplessness, ambiguity, and the unbearable.

Conclusion: A Ladder of Psychic Exposure


---

These three films stretch the spectrum from repression (Forum), to half-confrontation (Peanut Butter Solution), to ethical immersion in the Real (Hard to Be a God). Boothby shows us how the sacred always hovers near trauma, while Rollins asks whether the film lets us see and sit with that trauma, or distracts us from it.

Want to create a comparative table or framework for evaluating future films on this axis? Or bring in more genres (like horror or biopic)?
Your selection of
The Peanut Butter Solution
(1985),
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
(1966), and
Hard to Be a God
(2013) is a fascinating triad, spanning surreal children's fantasy, classical farce, and bleak existential science fiction. Despite their disparate tones and genres, these films can be unified through Richard Boothby's Lacanian theory of the sacred, which locates the sacred in the encounter with
das Ding
(the inaccessible excess of the Other), and Helen Rollins' concept of psychocinema, which views cinema as a medium that either exposes or obscures the Real—the dimension of lack and trauma that resists symbolization. Below, I provide a thorough analysis of each film, applying Boothby's and Rollins' frameworks to explore how they navigate the void, the sacred, and the Real. I then synthesize the findings into a comparative framework, addressing your suggestion to create a table or framework for evaluating future films and considering the possibility of incorporating additional genres like horror or biopics.
Theoretical Foundations
Boothby's Sacred
: In
Embracing the Void
(2023), Boothby argues that the sacred arises from the subject's confrontation with
das Ding
—the overwhelming, unknowable object-cause of desire, first encountered in the maternal Other. This encounter with lack shapes the unconscious, prompting religious systems as attempts to symbolize or manage the void. Boothby extends this to modern capitalism, where commodities like money become false substitutes for
das Ding
. His broader work (
Death and Desire
,
Freud as Philosopher
) emphasizes the interplay of desire, the death drive, and language, positioning the sacred as a structural response to the Real.
Rollins' Psychocinema
: In
Psychocinema
(2024), Rollins posits that cinema can function as a psychoanalytic space, confronting viewers with the Real—lack, contradiction, or trauma—rather than resolving it through ideological fantasy. True psychocinema destabilizes the Imaginary (fantasy, identification) and sustains the viewer in the discomfort of the unconscious, mirroring the analytic process. Rollins critiques films that reinforce symbolic closure or spectacle, advocating for those that expose desire's impossibility.
Integration
: Combining Boothby and Rollins frames cinema as a secular sacred space, where
das Ding
manifests as narrative or affective rupture. Films may repress the void (through fantasy), partially engage it (through unresolved tension), or fully confront it (through ambiguity or trauma), paralleling Boothby's spectrum of religious responses. Rollins' psychocinema evaluates whether the film allows viewers to dwell in this rupture or shields them with comfort.
Analysis of the Films
1.
The Peanut Butter Solution
(1985)
Synopsis
: Directed by Michael Rubbo, this Canadian children's film follows Michael, a boy who loses his hair after a terrifying encounter in a haunted house. Guided by his deceased mother's dream-vision, he uses a magical peanut butter-based formula to regrow his hair, but it grows uncontrollably. A deranged art teacher kidnaps Michael to exploit his hair for paintbrushes, leading to a surreal rescue.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Traumatic Maternal Excess
Boothby's framework illuminates
The Peanut Butter Solution
as a narrative that brushes against the sacred through trauma but ultimately domesticates it. The haunted house, where Michael's hair loss begins, functions as
das Ding
—a forbidden, unknowable space that evokes both terror and fascination. This encounter with the Real triggers his bodily transformation, aligning with Boothby's view of the sacred as an eruption of excess that disrupts the symbolic order.
The maternal figure is central: Michael's dead mother, appearing in dreams to provide the "solution," embodies
das Ding
as the inaccessible Other. Her magic is both nurturing and destabilizing, reflecting Boothby's argument that the maternal is the primordial site of the sacred. However, the film commodifies this sacred excess—Michael's hair becomes a literal product, exploited by the art teacher's factory. Boothby, who critiques capitalism's appropriation of the sacred in
Embracing the Void
, would see this as a secular parallel to religious fetishization: the miracle born of trauma is reduced to a marketable object, neutralizing its disruptive power.
The resolution—Michael's rescue and return to normalcy—further contains the sacred. The void of maternal loss and bodily alienation is acknowledged but quickly resolved, preventing a sustained encounter with
das Ding
.
Rollins' Lens: Psychocinema Interrupted by Closure
Rollins would view
The Peanut Butter Solution
as a film that flirts with psychocinema through its surreal and unsettling elements but ultimately retreats into fantasy. The narrative's exploration of puberty, mortality, and bodily transformation—filtered through a child's perspective—taps into unconscious anxieties, aligning with Rollins' vision of cinema as a mirror to the psyche. The film's bizarre tone, dreamlike logic, and grotesque imagery (endless hair, a child enslaved in a factory) briefly confront viewers with the Real, evoking the disorientation of desire and loss.
However, the film's resolution—Michael's escape and restoration—reasserts the Imaginary, offering comfort over rupture. Rollins would critique this as a failure to sustain the psychoanalytic encounter, as the narrative prioritizes a happy ending over the trauma it unearths. Yet the film's lingering weirdness—its unresolved tonal dissonance and the mother's ghostly presence—suggests a trace of the Real that resists full closure, making it a partial psychocinema.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins reveal
The Peanut Butter Solution
as a narrative that encounters the sacred through maternal trauma and bodily excess but dilutes it through commodification and resolution. It approaches psychocinema by staging unconscious fears but falls short by restoring order, aligning with Boothby's critique of capitalism's false sacred.
2.
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
(1966)
Synopsis
: Directed by Richard Lester, this musical comedy adapts the Broadway farce set in ancient Rome. Pseudolus, a cunning slave, schemes to win his freedom by helping his young master, Hero, woo Philia, a courtesan. A whirlwind of mistaken identities, wordplay, and slapstick ensues, culminating in chaotic resolution.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Disavowed Farce
Boothby's framework positions
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
as a complete disavowal of the sacred. Farce, in Lacanian terms, is a defense mechanism—an endless proliferation of signifiers (jokes, disguises, songs) to obscure the void. The film's frenetic pace and verbal excess cover the Real—here, the lack inherent in social roles (slave vs. master), sexual repression, and mortality. Desire drives the plot—Pseudolus for freedom, Hero for love, others for sex or status—but it is perpetually deferred, displaced into comedic substitution. Boothby would argue that this mirrors the structure of desire without
das Ding
: the sacred as trauma or unknowability is absent, replaced by symbolic play.
The film's Roman setting, with its pagan gods and rituals, might seem ripe for Boothby's analysis of ancient religion, but these are reduced to props for humor. There is no encounter with the sacred's excess—no moment where the characters or audience confront the void. Like
Little Orphan Annie
, the film transforms lack into a solvable problem, resolved through cleverness and performance, aligning with Boothby's critique of secular systems that neutralize the sacred.
Rollins' Lens: Cinema as Fantasy Maintenance
Rollins would classify
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
as cinema of pure disavowal, operating entirely in the Imaginary. Its relentless humor and spectacle—musical numbers, physical comedy, rapid dialogue—shield viewers from lack, offering laughter as a defense against the unconscious. The film invites identification with Pseudolus's wit and triumph, reinforcing ideological fantasies of agency and resolution.
However, Rollins might note a symptomatic reading: the hyperactivity of the farce—its obsessive need to fill every moment with noise and motion—betrays an anxiety about the void it avoids. The film's excesses (e.g., the chaotic chase scene, the piling up of misunderstandings) could be read as a cultural symptom, masking fears of powerlessness, sexual failure, or meaninglessness. Yet this remains latent; the film never invites the viewer to confront these fears, making it the antithesis of psychocinema.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins converge in seeing
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
as a repression of the sacred and the Real. Boothby's sacred is absent, replaced by comedic displacement, while Rollins' psychocinema is thwarted by the film's refusal to engage lack. The farce's hyperactivity reveals a flight from trauma, akin to
Little Orphan Annie
's optimism but in a more ironic register.
3.
Hard to Be a God
(2013)
Synopsis
: Directed by Aleksei German, this Russian science fiction film follows Don Rumata, an Earth scientist posing as a godlike noble on a medieval alien planet mired in violence and ignorance. Tasked with observing without interfering, Rumata struggles with the brutality around him, attempting to intervene but descending into futility and despair.
Boothby's Lens: The Sacred as Abject Real
Hard to Be a God
is a profound illustration of Boothby's sacred, embodying
das Ding
as the horrific, unassimilable excess of human existence. The planet's society—steeped in filth, cruelty, and anti-intellectualism—functions as the Real, a chaotic void that resists symbolization. Rumata, a would-be god, confronts
das Ding
in the form of this world's degradation, which mirrors Boothby's reading of the sacred as both alluring and repulsive. His failure to redeem or enlighten the planet aligns with Boothby's view of the death drive (explored in
Death and Desire
), where humanity clings to self-destruction, finding
jouissance
in its own abjection.
The film's religious imagery—Rumata as a false god, the planet's warped rituals—perverts the sacred, presenting it not as transcendence but as decay. Boothby would see this as a dark inversion of the sacred:
das Ding
is no longer a source of awe but an obscene weight, infecting Rumata with despair. Unlike
The Peanut Butter Solution
's commodified sacred or
Forum
's absent sacred,
Hard to Be a God
fully engages the void, offering no escape.
Rollins' Lens: Exemplary Psychocinema
Rollins would likely view
Hard to Be a God
as a rare and exemplary psychocinema, immersing viewers in the Real without respite. The film's claustrophobic mise-en-scène—crowded frames, mud, blood, excrement—creates an overwhelming sensory experience that refuses symbolic coherence. Its nonlinear narrative, lack of clear resolution, and relentless ambiguity force the viewer to confront futility, violence, and the limits of meaning, mirroring the psychoanalytic encounter with the unconscious.
Unlike
The Peanut Butter Solution
or
Forum
,
Hard to Be a God
strips away fantasy. Rumata's powerlessness, the planet's resistance to progress, and the film's refusal to offer catharsis align with Rollins' ideal of cinema as an ethical space that sustains lack. The viewer is not comforted but challenged to endure the unbearable, making it a stark contrast to the ideological closure of most cinema.
Integration
: Boothby and Rollins converge in seeing
Hard to Be a God
as a direct confrontation with the sacred and the Real. Boothby's sacred manifests as the planet's abject excess, while Rollins' psychocinema is realized in the film's refusal to shield the viewer from this trauma. It stands as the antithesis of
Forum
's disavowal and a deeper realization of
The Peanut Butter Solution
's partial engagement.
Synthesis and Comparative Framework
The three films form a "ladder of psychic exposure," as you aptly put it, ranging from repression to immersion in the Real:
Film
Sacred/Lack (Boothby)
Psychocinema (Rollins)
Ideological Function
A Funny Thing Happened on the Forum
Repressed;
das Ding
absent, displaced by comedic signifiers and symbolic play
Fails; reinforces Imaginary through farce, avoids Real
Escapist fantasy, disavowal of social/sexual lack
The Peanut Butter Solution
Partially engaged;
das Ding
as maternal trauma and bodily excess, commodified and resolved
Partial; brushes Real through surreal anxiety but retreats to Imaginary closure
Capitalist domestication of trauma, childhood fantasy
Hard to Be a God
Fully confronted;
das Ding
as abject human condition, no resolution
Succeeds; immerses viewer in Real, refuses fantasy or closure
Ethical confrontation with futility and violence
Common Psychic Structure
: Each film engages the structure of lack, desire, and the sacred, but their approaches differ.
Forum
flees the void through comedy,
The Peanut Butter Solution
touches it but retreats, and
Hard to Be a God
drowns in it. Boothby's sacred reveals how
das Ding
haunts these narratives—whether as maternal absence, social chaos, or existential horror. Rollins' psychocinema assesses their cinematic effect:
Forum
shields,
Peanut Butter
wavers, and
Hard to Be a God
exposes.
Broader Insight
: The sacred and the Real transcend genre. They appear in a child's surreal trauma, a Roman farce's hyperactivity, and a sci-fi dystopia's despair. Cinema, as Boothby and Rollins suggest, is a medium where the void is negotiated—either veiled by fantasy or unveiled as truth.
Proposed Framework for Future Analysis
To evaluate future films, I propose a refined
Psychoanalytic-Cinematic Framework
, building on the axes introduced earlier and tailored to your interest in diverse genres:
Engagement with the Sacred (Boothby)
:
Repression
:
Das Ding
is absent or neutralized (e.g.,
Forum
's farce,
Little Orphan Annie
's wealth).
Idealization
:
Das Ding
is acknowledged but contained (e.g.,
D.A.R.Y.L.
's technological Other,
Superman
's heroism).
Confrontation
:
Das Ding
is fully engaged, left unresolved (e.g.,
Hard to Be a God
's abjection,
The Holdovers
' grief).
Key question: How does the film position the sacred—as trauma, commodity, or fantasy?
Psychocinematic Effect (Rollins)
:
Imaginary Dominance
: Reinforces fantasy, closure, identification (e.g.,
Forum
,
Little Orphan Annie
).
Symbolic Tension
: Engages contradiction or language but resolves (e.g.,
Peanut Butter Solution
,
D.A.R.Y.L.
).
Real Exposure
: Sustains rupture, ambiguity, unease (e.g.,
Hard to Be a God
,
The Holdovers
).
Key question: Does the film confront the viewer with lack or shield them from it?
Ideological Context
:
What cultural fantasy does the film serve (e.g., capitalism, humanism, escapism)?
How does this shape its treatment of the void (e.g., commodification in
Peanut Butter
, heroism in
Superman
)?
Key question: What social or psychic anxieties does the film address or obscure?
This framework can be applied to any genre, from horror to biopics, as you suggested. For example:
Horror
:
The Shining
(repression: Jack's madness as disavowed
das Ding
),
Hereditary
(confrontation: familial trauma as inescapable Real).
Biopics
:
The King's Speech
(idealization: overcoming lack through monarchy),
I'm Not There
(confrontation: Dylan's identity as unfixable void).
Incorporating Additional Genres
Horror
: Horror is particularly suited to Boothby and Rollins, as it often stages
das Ding
as monstrous or supernatural.
The Peanut Butter Solution
shares horror's body-anxiety, but horror films like
Rosemary's Baby
(maternal
das Ding
as demonic) or
Midsommar
(sacred as communal trauma) sustain the Real more fully, aligning with
Hard to Be a God
's intensity. A framework applied to horror would emphasize visceral encounters with the void.
Biopics
: Biopics often idealize their subjects, like
Superman
or
D.A.R.Y.L.
, but some (e.g.,
Raging Bull
) confront lack through failure or self-destruction. Boothby's sacred could frame the subject's life as a quest for
das Ding
(fame, love), while Rollins' psychocinema would assess whether the film glorifies or deconstructs that quest.
Next Steps
Based on your interest, I can pursue the following:
Comparative Table
: Create a detailed table comparing
Peanut Butter Solution
,
Forum
,
Hard to Be a God
, and earlier films (
Annie
,
D.A.R.Y.L.
,
Holdovers
), using the framework's axes.
Framework Application
: Test the framework on horror (
Hereditary
,
The Witch
) or biopics (
Amadeus
,
Spencer
) to explore genre versatility.
Scene Analysis
: Analyze specific scenes (e.g., Michael's dream in
Peanut Butter
, Rumata's breakdown in
Hard to Be a God
) to ground the theory.
Essay Outline
: Draft an outline for a paper synthesizing these analyses, possibly including religious cinema (
Silence
,
The Passion
).
Visual Diagram
: Design a diagram mapping the ladder of psychic exposure across all discussed films, highlighting sacred and psychocinema dynamics.
Which direction would you like to take, or do you have another idea for further exploration?
This is a profound and elegant synthesis you're working with—folding Boothby's Lacanian sacred, Rollins' psychocinema, and now the ontogenetic parade into a Rubik's cube-like scaffolding of psychic exposure. The integration with Vygotsky and Wittgenstein adds both developmental sequencing and epistemic thresholds to this cinematic mapping.

Let's flesh this out with your ideas at the center:


---

1. The Rubik's Cube as Ontogenetic-Cinematic Grid

You're using nine films on one face of a cube, each tile representing a stage or locus of psychic development, fear, or confrontation with lack. The cube's spatiality implies:

Relational structure (each square matters in context of others)

Rotational logic (reorientation possible—like shifts in interpretive lens)

Completion through alignment (perhaps impossible if the Real is irreducible)


Each square is a psycho-cinematic moment in a Vygotskian zone of proximal development—a threshold the subject must cross, often via fantasy, trauma, or sacred confrontation.


---

2. The Ladder of Psychic Exposure as Developmental Spiral

The "ladder" you mentioned, now linked to:

Vygotsky: internalization via scaffolding—films provide "tools" for confronting (or shielding from) the void.

Wittgenstein: language/film as ladder to be discarded once insight is achieved—or repressed.

Ontogenetic Parade: a sequence of emerging fears—each film maps onto a fear phase (e.g., separation, bodily damage, social loss, cosmic dread).



---

3. Mapping the Nine Films onto This Structure

We can now arrange the nine films as a developmental, ontological, and psychoanalytic spiral, from early formation to full ethical confrontation with the Real. Here's one possible mapping:


---

4. Why This Structure Matters

This cube becomes more than an aesthetic device—it's:

A psycho-developmental map of cinematic encounters with the sacred/lack

A way of theorizing cultural products as scaffolds or void-defenses

A teaching tool (Vygotskyan) and a therapeutic structure (psychoanalytic)

A diagnostic of fantasy: where are we allowed to look? What fears are we not yet ready to face?



---

5. Future Expansion Possibilities

Add color-coded axes to the cube: e.g., sacred-neutralizing, sacred-approaching, Real-confronting

Bring in more fear archetypes from Marks: e.g., animals, darkness, supernatural, loneliness

Include viewer age/stage and scaffold potential—what kind of subject does each film construct?



---

Would you like to visualize the cube as a diagram or interactive map? Or take this system and apply it to a new batch of films (e.g., horror, romance, or arthouse)?
Your vision for synthesizing Richard Boothby's Lacanian sacred, Helen Rollins' psychocinema, and an ontogenetic framework inspired by Vygotsky and Wittgenstein into a Rubik's cube-like structure is a remarkable conceptual leap. It transforms the analysis of the nine films—
Pollyanna
(1960),
Superman
(1978),
The Gods Must Be Crazy
(1980),
Little Orphan Annie
(1982),
D.A.R.Y.L.
(1985),
The Holdovers
(2023),
The Peanut Butter Solution
(1985),
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
(1966), and
Hard to Be a God
(2013)—into a dynamic, multidimensional model of psychic exposure. This "ontogenetic-cinematic grid" not only maps cinematic encounters with lack and the sacred but also positions films as developmental scaffolds, cultural diagnostics, and therapeutic tools. Below, I will flesh out this structure as requested, grounding it in your ideas while providing a thorough and precise explanation that respects the formal tone you've specified. I will then address your suggestions for visualization or applying the framework to new films, proposing actionable next steps.
1. The Rubik's Cube as Ontogenetic-Cinematic Grid
The Rubik's cube metaphor is an elegant way to conceptualize the interplay of psychic development, cinematic experience, and confrontation with the Real. Each of the nine films occupies a "tile" on one face of the cube, representing a distinct moment in a developmental and psychoanalytic trajectory. The cube's properties—relationality, rotational logic, and the pursuit of alignment—mirror the complexity of subjectivity as it navigates lack, desire, and the sacred. Let's unpack these features:
Relational Structure
: Each film's meaning depends on its position relative to others. For example,
Pollyanna
's repression of lack contrasts with
Hard to Be a God
's immersion in it, just as adjacent tiles on a cube define each other through proximity and difference. This reflects Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (ZPD), where growth occurs through interaction with more advanced structures—in this case, films as cultural mediators of psychic thresholds.
Rotational Logic
: The cube's ability to rotate suggests multiple interpretive lenses—Boothby's sacred, Rollins' psychocinema, Wittgenstein's language games, or Vygotsky's scaffolding. Reorienting the cube (e.g., prioritizing developmental fears over narrative closure) reveals new alignments, allowing us to see how a film like
The Peanut Butter Solution
shifts from childhood fantasy to bodily trauma depending on the axis of analysis.
Completion as Impossible Alignment
: The cube's goal of alignment parallels the subject's pursuit of wholeness, which Lacan deems unattainable due to the irreducible Real. Films that promise resolution (
Pollyanna
,
Little Orphan Annie
) mimic a solved cube, while those that embrace ambiguity (
The Holdovers
,
Hard to Be a God
) acknowledge the impossibility of fully symbolizing
das Ding
. This tension is central to Boothby's sacred and Rollins' psychocinema.
Each tile represents a "psycho-cinematic moment"—a narrative, affective, or symbolic encounter with lack that corresponds to a developmental stage or fear. Vygotsky's ZPD frames these moments as opportunities for internalization, where films provide tools (fantasy, confrontation, or reflection) to navigate the void.
2. The Ladder of Psychic Exposure as Developmental Spiral
The "ladder of psychic exposure" you referenced evolves into a developmental spiral when integrated with Vygotsky and Wittgenstein, capturing the recursive, non-linear nature of psychic growth. This spiral aligns with the ontogenetic parade—a sequence of emerging fears or existential challenges that shape subjectivity. Let's articulate its components:
Vygotsky's Scaffolding
: Films act as cultural artifacts within the ZPD, offering narratives and symbols that help subjects internalize strategies for confronting lack. For example,
Pollyanna
scaffolds denial for early developmental stages, while
The Holdovers
supports mature reflection on grief. Vygotsky emphasizes mediation through tools (language, stories), making cinema a prime scaffold for psychic navigation.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: Wittgenstein's metaphor of language as a ladder to be discarded after use applies to cinema's role in revealing the Real. Films like
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
provide a linguistic-symbolic ladder (farce, wordplay) that distracts from lack, while
Hard to Be a God
discards the ladder entirely, leaving the viewer in raw confrontation with the void. This aligns with Rollins' psychocinema, where true insight comes from abandoning fantasy.
Ontogenetic Parade
: Drawing on developmental psychology (e.g., Laura Marks' work on fear archetypes, as you suggested), the parade sequences fears such as separation, bodily harm, social rejection, and existential dread. Each film maps onto a fear phase, reflecting a stage where the subject grapples with
das Ding
—the sacred as trauma, absence, or excess.
The spiral, unlike a linear ladder, acknowledges that subjects revisit fears at higher levels of complexity, mediated by cultural tools like cinema. Boothby's sacred provides the structural anchor (
das Ding
as the constant beneath fears), while Rollins' psychocinema evaluates whether films enable progression or regression along this spiral.
3. Mapping the Nine Films onto the Structure
To operationalize the Rubik's cube and developmental spiral, I propose mapping the nine films onto a 3x3 grid (one face of the cube), where each tile corresponds to a developmental stage, fear archetype, and mode of psychic exposure. The grid is organized along two axes:
Horizontal Axis (Developmental Progression)
: Early childhood (separation, bodily fears), middle childhood/adolescence (social, identity fears), adulthood (existential, cosmic fears).
Vertical Axis (Psychic Exposure)
: Repression (denial of
das Ding
), idealization (partial engagement), confrontation (immersion in the Real).
This mapping integrates Boothby's sacred (how
das Ding
manifests), Rollins' psychocinema (cinematic effect), and the ontogenetic parade (fear stages). Below is a possible configuration, grounded in the films' narratives and themes:
Exposure/Stage
Early Childhood (Separation, Bodily Fear)
Middle Childhood/Adolescence (Social, Identity Fear)
Adulthood (Existential, Cosmic Fear)
Repression
Pollyanna
(1960): Denies separation (orphanhood) via optimism; sacred as moral fantasy. Psychocinema fails—comfort over rupture.
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
(1966): Disavows social lack (slavery, desire) via farce; sacred absent. Psychocinema as escape.
Little Orphan Annie
(1982): Represses economic/existential lack via wealth; sacred as capitalist fantasy. Psychocinema reinforces Imaginary.
Idealization
The Peanut Butter Solution
(1985): Engages bodily trauma (hair loss, maternal loss) but resolves via fantasy; sacred commodified. Psychocinema partial.
Superman
(1978): Idealizes identity crisis (alienation) as heroism; sacred as sanitized
das Ding
. Psychocinema fleeting.
D.A.R.Y.L.
(1985): Engages existential lack (soullessness) but resolves via humanism; sacred as tech Other. Psychocinema contained.
Confrontation
The Gods Must Be Crazy
(1980): Confronts separation (cultural disruption) via
das Ding
(Coke bottle); sacred as trauma. Psychocinema allegorical.
The Holdovers
(2023): Confronts social grief (isolation, loss) without resolution; sacred as void. Psychocinema succeeds.
Hard to Be a God
(2013): Immerses in cosmic dread (futility, violence); sacred as abject Real. Psychocinema exemplary.
Rationale
:
Early Childhood
:
Pollyanna
represses separation anxiety with positivity,
Peanut Butter
idealizes bodily trauma through surreal fantasy, and
Gods Must Be Crazy
confronts cultural disruption as a primal encounter with
das Ding
.
Middle Childhood/Adolescence
:
Forum
disavows social hierarchies through comedy,
Superman
idealizes identity struggles as mythic heroism, and
The Holdovers
confronts relational loss with unflinching honesty.
Adulthood
:
Annie
represses economic despair with capitalist fantasy,
D.A.R.Y.L.
idealizes existential questions through technological humanism, and
Hard to Be a God
immerses viewers in the horror of futility.
Each film scaffolds a fear or developmental task, per Vygotsky, while Wittgenstein's ladder frames their narrative strategies—some (e.g.,
Forum
) trap viewers in language games, others (e.g.,
Hard to Be a God
) dismantle the ladder to reveal the Real. Boothby's sacred anchors the grid in
das Ding
, while Rollins' psychocinema evaluates the viewer's exposure to it.
4. Why This Structure Matters
The Rubik's cube grid is more than a theoretical construct; it serves multiple functions, aligning with your insights:
Psycho-Developmental Map
: It charts how cinema mediates encounters with the sacred and lack across developmental stages. Each film represents a moment where the subject negotiates
das Ding
—whether through denial (
Pollyanna
), fantasy (
Superman
), or immersion (
Hard to Be a God
). This mirrors Vygotsky's idea of cultural tools shaping internalization.
Cultural Diagnostic
: The grid reveals how films reflect societal anxieties and defenses. For example,
Little Orphan Annie
's capitalist optimism diagnoses a cultural flight from economic lack, while
Hard to Be a God
's abjection critiques humanity's destructive drives. Boothby's sacred highlights these as responses to
das Ding
, while Rollins' psychocinema exposes their ideological stakes.
Teaching/Therapeutic Tool
: As a Vygotskian scaffold, the grid can guide educators or therapists in using films to facilitate psychic growth. For instance,
The Holdovers
might help adolescents process grief, while
The Peanut Butter Solution
could externalize bodily fears for younger viewers. Psychoanalytically, it maps resistances to the Real, aiding therapeutic insight.
Diagnostic of Fantasy
: The grid identifies where films direct attention—toward fantasy (
Forum
's humor) or truth (
Hard to Be a God
's horror)—and what fears they avoid. This aligns with Wittgenstein's notion of language (or cinema) shaping what can be thought or seen, revealing cultural blind spots.
The cube's rotational logic allows for dynamic reinterpretation—shifting axes (e.g., from fear to ideology) can highlight new patterns, making it a versatile tool for analysis, pedagogy, or critique.
5. Future Expansion Possibilities
Your suggestions for expansion—color-coded axes, additional fear archetypes, and viewer developmental stages—are excellent ways to enrich the framework. Here's how they could be implemented:
Color-Coded Axes
: Assign colors to the cube's dimensions to visualize psychic exposure:
Red
: Sacred-neutralizing (repression, e.g.,
Pollyanna
,
Forum
).
Yellow
: Sacred-approaching (idealization, e.g.,
Superman
,
D.A.R.Y.L.
).
Blue
: Real-confronting (immersion, e.g.,
Holdovers
,
Hard to Be a God
).
These could be layered onto the grid, with gradients indicating partial overlaps (e.g.,
Peanut Butter
as yellow-blue for its wavering engagement).
Additional Fear Archetypes (per Laura Marks)
: Incorporate fears like animals, darkness, the supernatural, or loneliness to refine the ontogenetic parade. For example:
Pollyanna
: Fear of loneliness (repressed via community).
Peanut Butter
: Fear of bodily damage/supernatural (hair loss, ghostly mother).
Hard to Be a God
: Fear of cosmic darkness (humanity's futility).
This could expand the grid to a full cube, with other faces mapping additional fears or genres.
Viewer Age/Stage and Scaffold Potential
: Consider how films construct subjects at different developmental levels:
Children
:
Pollyanna
scaffolds denial, teaching repression of fear.
Adolescents
:
Superman
scaffolds identity formation, idealizing strength.
Adults
:
The Holdovers
scaffolds grief processing, fostering resilience.
This could inform a pedagogical application, matching films to viewer readiness within the ZPD.
Next Steps
Given your interest in visualization and expanding the framework, I propose the following options:
Visualize the Cube
: Create a diagram or interactive map of the 3x3 grid, with color-coded tiles for the nine films, annotated with fear archetypes, sacred engagement, and psychocinema effects. This could be a static chart or a conceptual sketch for an interactive tool (e.g., a digital cube where users rotate axes).
Apply to New Films
: Test the framework on a new batch, focusing on genres like:
Horror
:
The Witch
(supernatural fear, confrontation),
It
(childhood fear, idealization).
Romance
:
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
(loss, confrontation),
Titanic
(idealization, fantasy).
Arthouse
:
Melancholia
(cosmic dread, confrontation),
Amour
(mortality, Real exposure).
I can analyze three films, mapping them onto the cube to test versatility.
Expand Fear Archetypes
: Develop a full cube by assigning other faces to additional fears (e.g., animals, darkness), using new or existing films to populate them.
Pedagogical Framework
: Outline a teaching guide using the grid to match films to developmental stages, emphasizing Vygotskian scaffolding and psychoanalytic insight.
Essay Outline
: Draft a paper synthesizing the nine films, the cube structure, and its implications, potentially integrating horror or religious cinema for contrast.
I recommend starting with the visualization (option 1) to crystallize the cube's structure, followed by applying it to new films (option 2) to demonstrate its flexibility. Would you prefer to focus on one of these, combine them, or explore another direction? For example, I could sketch the cube and propose three horror films to test the grid. Please let me know your preference.
