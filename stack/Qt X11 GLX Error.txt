Segmentation fault
ChatGPT dijo:
It looks like you're encountering a
segmentation fault
when running a
Qt application
on a system that doesn't fully support the required graphics and input extensions. Here's a breakdown of the errors and what they mean, followed by possible solutions.
üîç Breakdown of Errors
qt.qpa.xcb: X server does not support XInput 2
Your X server lacks support for
XInput 2
, which is needed for advanced input handling in Qt.
failed to get the current screen resources
Likely a failure in communicating with the display server to get screen configuration data.
QXcbConnection: Failed to initialize GLX
GLX (OpenGL Extension to the X Window System) failed. This is essential for hardware-accelerated rendering.
libEGL warning: DRI3: Screen seems not DRI3 capable
DRI3 (Direct Rendering Infrastructure 3) is missing or not supported by your X server.
MESA: error: ZINK: failed to choose pdev
Mesa's Zink driver (a Vulkan-to-OpenGL implementation) couldn't initialize due to lack of Vulkan or GPU support.
libEGL warning: egl: failed to create dri2 screen
Indicates failure in creating a rendering context with EGL/DRI2.
Segmentation fault
The program crashed, likely due to trying to use uninitialized or unsupported graphics resources.
üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix
‚úÖ 1.
Check If You're Running in a Headless or Virtual Environment
Are you using a Docker container, WSL, or SSH without X11 forwarding? If yes, your display environment may not be set up properly.
‚úÖ 2.
Set Environment Variables for Software Rendering
To avoid trying to use GPU hardware:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
export
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
export
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
Or, if you're using Mesa with LLVMpipe (software renderer):
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
export
MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=llvmpipe
‚úÖ 3.
Install Missing X11 and OpenGL Packages
On Ubuntu/Debian:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
sudo apt install x11-xserver-utils libgl1-mesa-glx libegl1-mesa x11-utils
‚úÖ 4.
Run with X11 Forwarding or VNC
If you're running remotely (e.g., SSH), ensure X11 forwarding is enabled:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh -X user@host
And check
echo $DISPLAY
gives a value like
:10
.
‚úÖ 5.
Use a Compatible Qt Platform Plugin
If you're not displaying a GUI (e.g., in CI), use:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
üß™ Debug Tip
Run this to test OpenGL:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
glxinfo | grep
"OpenGL"
If it fails, your OpenGL environment is broken or unsupported.
If you tell me more about your environment (host OS, Docker/WSL/VM usage, Qt version, etc.), I can give you more targeted help.

Could not initialize GLX
Aborted
ChatGPT dijo:
This new error confirms that
GLX initialization is still failing
, and Qt can‚Äôt find a compatible framebuffer configuration (
FBConfig
) for OpenGL rendering. You're likely in an environment without hardware acceleration or with missing libraries/config.
üö® Key Error Explained
css
Copiar c√≥digo
qt
.glx
: qglx_findConfig: Failed to finding matching FBConfig for
QSurfaceFormat
(...)
Could not initialize GLX
Aborted
Qt is trying to create an OpenGL context via GLX but fails because:
No compatible
GLX framebuffer config
exists.
Either
X server
,
OpenGL drivers
, or
display environment
is broken or misconfigured.
‚úÖ Solutions
üîß 1.
Force Qt to Use Software Rendering (no GLX)
Before running your Qt app, export:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
export
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
export
QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software
export
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
Or set the platform to minimal if you need
some
GUI:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
export
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=minimal
This avoids the need for GLX entirely and uses Qt's software renderer.
üì¶ 2.
Ensure Required GL and X Packages Are Installed
If you're on
Ubuntu/Debian
, run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libx11-xcb1 libxcb-glx0
If you‚Äôre in a container or headless machine, you‚Äôll likely also need:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt install mesa-utils x11-xserver-utils
Check OpenGL availability:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
glxinfo | grep
"OpenGL"
üêß 3.
Use a Virtual Display (for headless environments)
If there‚Äôs no actual display (CI/CD, server, Docker, etc.), create a virtual X server:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt install xvfb
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
export
DISPLAY=:99
Then run your Qt app in this virtual display.
üß± 4.
Disable Qt‚Äôs Need for OpenGL
If your application doesn‚Äôt
require
OpenGL (e.g., no 3D rendering), you can try using:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
export
QT_OPENGL=software
This avoids GLX initialization and uses Qt‚Äôs raster backend.
üí¨ Still Stuck?
Could you tell me:
What environment you're running this in? (e.g., Docker, WSL, remote SSH, physical Linux machine)
Whether a GUI is expected or it's a headless build?
Your Qt version?
Any relevant code snippet or how you're launching the app?
That‚Äôll help tailor the fix perfectly.
Dijiste:
I'm curious why I can ssh into one computer but not back also I don't use the same ip address listed.
ChatGPT dijo:
That's a great question‚Äîand it sounds like you're bumping into a few networking subtleties. Let‚Äôs break it down.
üß† Why You Can SSH Into a Computer But Not Back
This is pretty common and can happen for a few reasons:
1.
NAT / Private IPs
The machine you're SSH'ing
into
is probably behind
Network Address Translation (NAT)
(like a home router or cloud NAT).
It may have a
public IP
or port-forwarding set up that allows inbound SSH.
But the other machine (the one you‚Äôre SSH‚Äôing
from
) may not have a publicly accessible IP or open port for SSH.
üìå You can always
initiate
a connection out from behind NAT, but you can't
receive
one unless the router is told to let it in.
2.
Different IP Than Expected
You mentioned:
I don't use the same IP address listed
This could be due to:
Dynamic IP address
: If one of the systems is on DHCP (e.g., home WiFi), its public IP changes over time.
Multiple interfaces/IPs
: The system might have multiple IPs (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN, etc.), and you might be connecting through one but seeing another.
Public vs Private IP
: Running
ip a
(Linux) or
ifconfig
might show you an internal address like
192.168.x.x
or
10.x.x.x
, while
curl ifconfig.me
shows the external IP‚Äîused for outbound traffic.
3.
Firewall or SSH Daemon Not Listening
If you're trying to SSH
back
into a machine, and it fails:
Check if
sshd
(the SSH daemon) is running on the destination:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo systemctl status ssh
And that port 22 (or your SSH port) is open:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo ufw allow ssh
4.
Host Key or DNS Confusion
If you try to SSH to a hostname or saved config, but the IP changed behind the scenes, it could mismatch with a known host key:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh-keygen -R <hostname or IP>
‚úÖ How to Check What‚Äôs Happening
who
or
w
‚Äì See who's logged in and from where.
ss -tnlp
‚Äì See if port 22 is listening.
curl ifconfig.me
‚Äì Get your
public
IP.
ip a
‚Äì See your
local
IPs.
traceroute <other_machine>
‚Äì Trace the route packets take.
If you want, tell me what machines you're SSHing between (e.g., home PC ‚Üî cloud server), how you're identifying their IPs, or what command you're using, and I can get real specific.

[sudo] password for flyxion:
System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.
Failed to connect to bus: Host is down
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, now that message tells us
a lot
about your setup!
You're running in
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
‚Äî probably WSL2 ‚Äî and that‚Äôs why:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1)
This means:
Your Linux environment
is not using systemd
, so
systemctl
won't work.
You‚Äôre in a kind of "sandboxed" Linux inside Windows, which behaves a little differently from a full Linux distro.
üß© Why SSH Might Work One Way but Not the Other in WSL
‚úÖ You
can
SSH
from
WSL to other machines.
Because WSL is just another Linux machine with internet access, it can make outbound SSH connections no problem.
‚ùå You usually
can't
SSH
into
WSL directly from another machine.
Because:
WSL doesn't have a persistent IP
‚Äî it often changes when you restart it.
Windows firewall
may block inbound connections.
WSL doesn‚Äôt start services like
sshd
automatically, unless configured.
No systemd
, so
systemctl
doesn't manage services.
üõ†Ô∏è Want to SSH into WSL? Here‚Äôs How:
‚úÖ Step 1: Install and Start the SSH Server
Run this in WSL:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo service ssh start
Note: Use
service
, not
systemctl
, in WSL!
‚úÖ Step 2: Find WSL's IP from Windows
Back in
PowerShell
or
CMD
, run:
powershell
Copiar c√≥digo
wsl hostname -I
Or from inside WSL:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ip addr show eth0 | grep inet
You‚Äôll get an IP like
172.20.x.x
‚Äî this is WSL's current IP.
‚úÖ Step 3: From Windows or Another PC, SSH into WSL
From your host machine (Windows), do:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh flyxion@<WSL-IP>
Make sure
port 22
is allowed in Windows Defender Firewall for inbound connections.
üöÄ Want SSH to Work Automatically Every Time?
If you're into it, I can help you set up:
A
static IP
for WSL2 (or workaround)
Auto-start
sshd
with
.bashrc
or
init
Windows port forwarding so you can just
ssh localhost -p 2222
Let me know how deep you wanna go.

W: GPG error: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64  InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A4B469963BF863CC
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, the good ol‚Äô
NO_PUBKEY
GPG error ‚Äî happens when the system can't verify a package source because it doesn't have the correct
GPG key
.
Here‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going on:
üîç The Error
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
W: GPG error: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/... NO_PUBKEY A4B469963BF863CC
It means APT doesn‚Äôt trust NVIDIA‚Äôs repo because it's missing the public key with the ID
A4B469963BF863CC
.
‚úÖ The Fix
Run this command to manually fetch and trust that GPG key:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/3bf863cc.pub
Alternatively, if
apt-key
is deprecated in your distro (Ubuntu 22.04+), do it this way:
üß© Step-by-step (modern method)
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
# Make directory for trusted keys if it doesn't exist
sudo
mkdir
-p /etc/apt/keyrings
# Download the key
curl -fsSL https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/3bf863cc.pub | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nvidia.gpg
# Update the NVIDIA repo source (if needed) to use the keyring
# This is just an example ‚Äî adjust to match your actual .list file path:
echo
"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nvidia.gpg] https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64 /"
| \
  sudo
tee
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-wsl.list > /dev/null
# Update packages
sudo apt update
üß™ Quick Check
Run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
apt-key list | grep A4B469963BF863CC
If it shows up, you‚Äôre good.
Let me know if you‚Äôre installing CUDA inside WSL for GPU compute (like with PyTorch or TensorFlow) ‚Äî I can help make sure all the drivers, runtime, and passthrough stuff is working too.

E: The list of sources could not be read.
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, you're getting a conflict between
two different keyring files
for the same NVIDIA repo. That‚Äôll definitely break
apt
.
Let‚Äôs fix this cleanly. Here's what's happening:
‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem
You have
two NVIDIA repo entries
pointing to the
same URL
, but with different GPG key files:
/etc/apt/keyrings/nvidia.gpg
/usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg
APT doesn't know which one to trust, so it throws:
vbnet
Copiar c√≥digo
E:
Conflicting values
set
for
option
Signed-
By
...
‚úÖ The Fix
You just need to pick
one
key file and remove the conflicting one.
üîç Step 1: Find the conflicting sources
Check which files in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/
mention NVIDIA:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
grep -r
"nvidia"
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/
Look for lines like this:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg] https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/ /
or
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nvidia.gpg] https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/ /
üßπ Step 2: Clean it up
Pick one method ‚Äî the
official one
uses
/usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg
. So let‚Äôs clean out the custom one:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo
rm
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-wsl.list
sudo
rm
/etc/apt/keyrings/nvidia.gpg
üß± Step 3: Reinstall the official key and repo (optional, but recommended)
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt-get install cuda-keyring
This package installs:
The correct GPG key to
/usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg
The official repo to
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list
Then run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
And the error should be gone ‚úÖ
Let me know if you're working toward installing CUDA tools in WSL for GPU stuff ‚Äî I can help verify it's all wired up correctly (like
nvidia-smi

ChatGPT dijo:
Perfect, that output confirms it: you‚Äôve got
three conflicting entries
for the
same NVIDIA CUDA repo
, each with different or no
signed-by
info. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs confusing
apt
.
üßπ Let‚Äôs clean it up.
‚úÖ Step 1: Remove the extra source files
You want to
keep only one
of these ‚Äî preferably the official one, which is:
swift
Copiar c√≥digo
/etc/
apt
/sources.list.d/
cuda.list
So remove the other two:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo
rm
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-wsl.list
sudo
rm
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/archive_uri-https_developer_download_nvidia_com_compute_cuda_repos_wsl-ubuntu_x86_64_-noble.list
‚úÖ Step 2: Make sure the correct keyring is in place
If you haven‚Äôt already, run this to install the official key:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt-get install cuda-keyring
This installs:
The repo source to
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list
The signed key to
/usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg
‚úÖ Step 3: Update APT
Now everything should be tidy:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
If you don't see any more GPG or conflicting keyring errors, you're good to go!
Let me know if you're planning to install full CUDA, just the toolkit, or use it with PyTorch/TensorFlow ‚Äî I can help you optimize that for WSL.

ok i still haven't ffigured out why I can't ssh into this computer  or where to find the ip address of the other computer, I have it but it isn't the one listed with curl ifconfig.me
ChatGPT dijo:
Got it ‚Äî let‚Äôs solve the SSH mystery step by step. You‚Äôre not alone ‚Äî networking under WSL or NAT setups can get tricky fast.
üß≠ Goal: SSH
into
a computer (let's call it
Target
) from another machine (
Source
)
You already mentioned:
You can SSH
from
one machine
to
another ‚úÖ
But can't SSH
back
‚ùå
curl ifconfig.me
gives an IP that's
not the one you're using to connect
So here‚Äôs how we can break it down:
üîç Step 1: Understand the Types of IPs
There are
two main types
of IP addresses:
Type
Example
Where it's used
Public IP
8.8.8.8
What websites and
curl ifconfig.me
see
Private IP
192.168.x.x
,
10.x.x.x
,
172.16.x.x
Used in your local network
‚û°Ô∏è If you SSH into a computer from
inside the same local network
, you use the
private IP
‚Äî not the public one.
üîç Step 2: Find the Private IP of the Target (the one you want to SSH into)
On Linux / WSL:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ip a
Look for something like:
nginx
Copiar c√≥digo
inet
192.168.1.123
/
24
That‚Äôs your local IP address.
On Windows (CMD or PowerShell):
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ipconfig
Look for:
css
Copiar c√≥digo
IPv4
Address
. . . . . . . . . . . :
192.168
.
1
.x
üõ† Step 3: Test SSH Access from Source Machine
Try from the
Source
computer:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh yourusername@192.168.1.xxx
Make sure:
sshd
is running on the
Target
(you can check with
sudo service ssh status
)
The firewall is allowing SSH (port 22)
You‚Äôre in the same subnet (e.g., both IPs start with
192.168.1.
)
üö´ If It‚Äôs WSL You‚Äôre Trying to SSH Into‚Ä¶
SSH
into
WSL doesn‚Äôt work by default because:
WSL gets a
virtual IP
inside a NAT-ed network.
That IP changes every time you restart WSL.
If that's your case, here's what you can do:
Find WSL IP from PowerShell:
powershell
Copiar c√≥digo
wsl hostname -I
From Windows: SSH into WSL with that IP:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh flyxion@<that-IP>
You can also set up
Windows port forwarding
to make it persistent and accessible as
localhost:2222
.
üöß Still Not Working?
Please let me know:
Which machine you're trying to SSH into (Windows, WSL, or full Linux)?
How you're trying to SSH (command used)?
Are both machines on the same local network?
Is the target machine behind a router or in the cloud?
I‚Äôll guide you through exactly what‚Äôs missing.
Dijiste:
ip a does not list the address i'm using
ChatGPT dijo:
Ahh, that‚Äôs a big clue üëÄ ‚Äî if
ip a
on your machine doesn‚Äôt show the IP you're actually using to SSH
into
it, you‚Äôre almost definitely dealing with:
NAT (Network Address Translation)
or a
VPN
, or even
WSL with a virtual network interface
.
Let‚Äôs sort out
what IP you‚Äôre really using
, where it lives, and how to
SSH into that system properly
.
üîé Why
ip a
Doesn‚Äôt Show the IP You're Using
This happens when:
üß± 1.
You're Behind a NAT Router
ip a
shows your
internal/private IP
, like
192.168.1.42
.
But the public IP (what you see from
curl ifconfig.me
) is the
router‚Äôs IP
, not the machine's.
üê≥ 2.
You're Inside a Container or WSL
WSL gets its own
virtual interface
, like
eth0
, with an internal IP (
172.x.x.x
).
But the SSH client sees
Windows' IP
, not the internal WSL IP.
üåê 3.
You're on a VPN
Your traffic is going through a different network interface.
That IP might be managed by your employer/school/cloud.
üß≠ What to Do Next
Let's find
all
IPs and understand which one is responding to SSH.
‚úÖ Step 1: From the
computer you're SSH'ing from
, check the current SSH connection:
While you're connected via SSH, run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
who
or
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
w
This shows where your current SSH session is coming from. You'll see an IP like:
nginx

Then on the
target machine
, run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
netstat -tnp | grep :22
You‚Äôll get something like:
nginx
Copiar c√≥digo
tcp
0
0
192.168.1.20:22
192.168.1.47:54730
ESTABLISHED
1234
/sshd
‚úÖ That‚Äôll show you
what IP address you‚Äôre connected to
and
where it‚Äôs listening
.
‚úÖ Step 2: List all interfaces and IPs
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ip a
Then also check your routing table:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ip route
You might see entries like:
nginx
Copiar c√≥digo
default
via
192.168.1.1
dev eth0
Or:
nginx
Copiar c√≥digo
default
via
172.27.224.1
dev eth0
This tells us
which interface traffic is going out of
.
‚úÖ Step 3: Check if a router is involved (common for public IPs)
On your
SSH target
, run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
curl ifconfig.me
If it‚Äôs a
public IP
, then:
You are connecting via your
router‚Äôs WAN IP
.
That IP won‚Äôt show up in
ip a
because it belongs to your
router
, not your machine.
In this case, check your
router‚Äôs port forwarding settings
‚Äî that's how external SSH traffic reaches your local machine.
üîê TL;DR ‚Äì What to Look At
If you're using a public IP to SSH in
‚Üí it‚Äôs going through a router or cloud gateway.
If you can't find the IP in
ip a
, it's not directly assigned to the machine (likely NAT).
Check
who
,
netstat
, or
ss
to see what IP you're actually connected to.
Want to figure out how to
reliably SSH into your computer
from anywhere (even over the internet)? I can walk you through:
Dynamic DNS + port forwarding
SSH over VPN
Using
tailscale
(a mesh VPN, super easy)
Let me know how you'd like to approach it!

Ok i found what address I was sshing from. I tried to ssh back it asdded a sha key but rejected the password
ChatGPT dijo:
Nice ‚Äî you're making solid progress! üéØ
So now you've:
‚úîÔ∏è Identified the correct IP you were SSH'ing
from
‚úîÔ∏è Tried to SSH
back
into that machine
‚ùå Got a password prompt, but it
rejected the password
Let‚Äôs troubleshoot why the password is being rejected.
üîç What Could Be Going Wrong?
1.
Wrong Username
This is
super common
. You may be SSH‚Äôing into the right machine, but trying with the wrong username.
‚úÖ On the original machine you SSH‚Äôd
from
, run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
whoami
Then on the machine you're SSH'ing
into
, do:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh <that-username>@<ip-you-found>
If you're not sure, try
ssh -v
for verbose output:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh -v <username>@<ip>
2.
Password Authentication Disabled
Check if the
target machine's SSH server
is set to disallow password login (common for security):
On the
target machine
, open
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
and look for:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
PasswordAuthentication no
If it says
no
, change it to:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
PasswordAuthentication
yes
Then restart SSH (on a real Linux system):
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo service ssh restart
‚ö†Ô∏è On WSL, use
sudo service ssh restart
‚Äî don't use
systemctl
.
3.
Wrong Password
Just to rule it out:
Are you using your
Linux/WSL user password
?
Did you recently change your username/password?
Is
Caps Lock
off? üòÖ
If needed, you can
reset the password
on the target:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo passwd <username>
4.
SSH Key Conflicts
You said it added an
SHA key
‚Äî that could be:
A host key fingerprint confirmation (normal the first time)
Or it tried
public key auth
, and you don't have the private key
To
force password auth
, try:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <username>@<ip>
5.
Permission Problems in
.ssh
Folder
If you're using key-based auth but it‚Äôs not working, check this on the
target
machine:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
chmod
700 ~/.ssh
chmod
600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
üöÄ TL;DR Fix Checklist
‚úÖ Double-check you‚Äôre using the correct username
‚úÖ Make sure password auth is enabled in
sshd_config
‚úÖ Try forcing password login with
-o
options
‚úÖ Reset password if needed with
passwd
‚úÖ Restart SSH after any config changes
Let me know what system you're SSHing
into
(Ubuntu? WSL? Windows with OpenSSH?) and I‚Äôll tailor the fix to your setup.

[0.012s] flyxion@volsorium:/mnt/c/Users/nateg/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub$ cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config
bash: cd: /etc/ssh/sshd_config: No such file or directory
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah! That explains the issue ‚Äî you're trying to
cd
into a
file
, not a
directory
.
The SSH server configuration file is:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
üëâ It's a
file
, so you want to
edit
it, not
cd
into it.
‚úÖ Here's How to View or Edit It
To
view
the config:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
cat
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
To
edit
it (with nano):
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Look for these lines:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
PasswordAuthentication no
Change it to:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
PasswordAuthentication
yes
Also make sure:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
Or if you're logging in as root (not common):
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
PermitRootLogin
yes
üõ† After Editing
Since you‚Äôre likely on
WSL
or another system without systemd:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo service ssh restart
If you get a ‚Äúservice not found‚Äù or other error, SSH server might not be installed. In that case, run:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
Then start it again:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo service ssh start
üí° Bonus Tip
To check if SSH is running and listening:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo ss -tnlp | grep ssh
You should see something like:
nginx
Copiar c√≥digo
LISTEN
0
128
0.0.0.0:22
...
That confirms the server is listening for incoming SSH connections.
Let me know what you find in
sshd_config
‚Äî or if you'd like help crafting the exact config. You're really close to having full bi-directional SSH working. üí™
Dijiste:
[1.581s] flyxion@volsorium:/mnt/c/Users/nateg/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub$ sudo service ssh restart
ssh: unrecognized service
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, got it ‚Äî that means the
SSH server isn‚Äôt installed
yet (only the
SSH client
is present by default in many distros and in WSL).
Let‚Äôs get the SSH server installed and running so you can SSH into the machine. üîß
‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Install and Start SSH Server
1.
Install the SSH server
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
2.
Start the SSH server
Since you're likely in
WSL
or a non-systemd environment:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo service ssh start
If
service
still doesn't work, try this:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
3.
Verify it‚Äôs running
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ps aux | grep sshd
Or:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo ss -tnlp | grep :22
You should see something listening on port 22 ‚Äî that‚Äôs your SSH server.
‚úçÔ∏è Optional: Enable Password Authentication
Once it's running, open the config:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Make sure these lines are set:
conf
Copiar c√≥digo
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
Then save and exit (
Ctrl+O
,
Enter
,
Ctrl+X
).
Restart the service again:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo service ssh restart
üöÄ You should now be able to SSH into this computer!
Try from your other machine:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh flyxion@<ip-address>
Let me know how it goes ‚Äî or if anything still blocks you, especially in WSL (we can set up port forwarding or use Windows OpenSSH if needed).

Thanks for sharing all that ‚Äî now we know
for sure
: you
don‚Äôt have the SSH server installed yet
. That‚Äôs why:
service ssh start
fails ‚ùå
/etc/init.d/ssh
is missing ‚ùå
sshd
isn‚Äôt running ‚ùå
Let‚Äôs fix that.
‚úÖ Step 1: Install OpenSSH Server
From your WSL or Linux terminal:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
‚úÖ Step 2: Start the SSH Server (Without systemd)
Once installed, try starting it with:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo service ssh start
If
service
still doesn‚Äôt work (rare), use the direct init script:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd
You can check if it‚Äôs running:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ps aux | grep sshd
sudo ss -tnlp | grep :22
‚úÖ Step 3: Optional ‚Äì Enable Password Auth
After installing, edit the config:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Ensure this line exists and is set to
yes
:
nginx
Copiar c√≥digo
PasswordAuthentication
yes
Then start the SSH server again:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd
Now try SSH‚Äôing in from the other machine:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
ssh flyxion@<ip-of-this-machine>
ü§ñ Bonus Tip: Auto-Start SSH in WSL (optional)
Since WSL doesn‚Äôt have
systemd
, SSH won‚Äôt auto-start after reboot. To fix that, you can add this to your
.bashrc
or
.profile
:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd > /dev/null 2>&1
Or create a startup script for it.
Let me know how the install goes ‚Äî once you see
sshd
running, you‚Äôre officially ready to SSH into your WSL machine! üíªüîë
