Abstract���Quantum-inspired Machine Learning (QiML) is a burgeoning i eld, receiving global attention from researchers for its 
potential to leverage principles of quantum mechanics within classical computational frameworks. However, current review literature 
often presents a superf i cial exploration of QiML, focusing instead on the broader Quantum Machine Learning (QML) i eld. In response 
to this gap, this survey provides an integrated and comprehensive examination of QiML, exploring QiML���s diverse research domains 
including tensor network simulations, dequantized algorithms, and others, showcasing recent advancements, practical applications, 
and illuminating potential future research avenues. Further, a concrete def i nition of QiML is established by analyzing various prior 
interpretations of the term and their inherent ambiguities. As QiML continues to evolve, we anticipate a wealth of future developments 
drawing from quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and classical machine learning, enriching the i eld further. This survey serves 
as a guide for researchers and practitioners alike, providing a holistic understanding of QiML���s current landscape and future directions.

1INTRODUCTION 
T 
HEf i eldofQuantum-InspiredMachineLearning 
(QiML) has seen substantial growth, garnering interest 
from researchers globally. A specialized subset of Quantum 
Machine Learning (QML), QiML focuses on developing 
classical machine learning algorithms inspired by principles 
of quantum mechanics within a classical computational 
framework, commonly referenced as the ���classical-classical��� 
quadrant of QML categorization as shown in Figure 1. QiML 
represents a multifaceted research domain, with investi- 
gations pushing to exceed conventional, classical state-of- 
the-art results, or exploring the expressivity provided by 
quantum formulations. 
To situate QiML within the context of QML, we brief l y 
expound upon the latter. QML, more broadly, sits at the 
fascinating intersection of quantum computing and ma- 
chine learning. The dominant research i eld concerns the 
���classical-quantum��� domain, and explores the use of quan- 
tum hardware to accelerate and enhance machine learning 
strategies. Here, two challenges present in classical machine 
learning are addressed. First, the increasing size and com- 
plexity of datasets in many i elds have created computa- 
tional challenges that classical machine learning struggles 
to manage eff i ciently. Secondly, quantum computing offers 
the potential to solve complex problems that are currently 
infeasible with classical computation methods [1]. Practical 
evaluation of QML algorithms on actual quantum hard- 
ware, however, is currently limited by factors such as the 
limited number of qubits, high error rates in quantum gates, 
diff i culty in maintaining quantum states (decoherence), and 
challenges associated with quantum error correction [2]. As 
a result, the QML landscape has been primarily shaped 
by theoretical considerations, with recent advancements in 
noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices providing 
an early, empirical glimpse into the potential of full-scale

quantum computing [3]. As such, the true extent and impact 
of QML on the machine learning landscape remains an 
ongoing research topics. 
QiML has evolved in tandem with QML research. In- 
stances of often cited research domains include tensor net- 
work quantum simulations and dequantized algorithms [4], 
[5]. However, in contrast with QML, discoveries in QiML 
are frequently backed by numerical evidence, facilitated by 
the absence of quantum hardware requirements, thereby 
enabling easier quantitative evaluations compared to other 
QML subsets. While QiML research is l ourishing, current 
survey literature often neglects this i eld, with a larger 
focus given to QML as a whole. Often, QiML is only 
brief l y mentioned or treated superf i cially [5], [6], [7], [8],

[9], [10]. Practical use cases of QiML, their applications, and 
comparative analyses with standard classical benchmarks 
often remain unexplored. This points to a crucial need for a 
standalone, in-depth review of QiML as a distinct i eld. 
Responding to this literature gap, our survey aims to 
provide a comprehensive, integrated discussion on the var- 
ious facets of QiML. We aim to provide an accessible and 
comprehensive overview of how QiML is used in practice, 
detailing its recent advancements and giving readers an 
understanding of the i eld���s progression. The reader should 
note that while exploring QiML methods from the lens of 
quantum mechanics and categorizing methods based on 
sources of inspiration would be of interest, this survey 
approaches the i eld from an applications perspective. The 
contributions of this survey are to provide an overview of 
the progression of QiML and its research directions in recent 
years, and to identify the future directions of QiML research.

2QUANTUM-INSPIREDMACHINELEARNING 
In this section, we dissect the QiML term into its constituent 
parts ��� ���quantum-inspired��� and ���machine learning��� ��� for 
a comprehensive understanding. Following this, we unpack 
the QiML term itself, integrating our analysis of its indi- 
vidual components. Our goal is to address inconsistencies 
in past literature, identify common threads, and propose 
a precise def i nition for QiML. This serves as a reliable 
compass, guiding future research in this dynamic i eld. 
2.1���Quantum-Inspired��� 
The term ���quantum-inspired��� was introduced by Moore 
and Narayanan [11] in the context of computing for the i rst 
time in 1995. The term was used to differentiate between 
two types of computational methods: ���pure��� quantum com- 
putation and quantum-inspired computation. The former 
is i rmly rooted in quantum mechanical concepts, such as 
standing waves, interference, and coherence, and can only 
be executed on a quantum computer. On the other hand, 
���quantum-inspired��� computing refers to practical methods 
that have been derived from these concepts. These meth- 
ods do not require a quantum computer, but rather utilize 
classical computers or algorithms to simulate quantum ef- 
fects and achieve computational advantages. The catego- 
rization of these two types of methods was signif i cant at 
the time, since quantum computing methods were not yet 
practically realizable due to the technological inability of 
implementing stable quantum systems with robust error 
correction [12]. The potential of quantum computing was 
known and acknowledged, as well as the challenges of 
practical implementation; many pure quantum algorithms 
still currently operate at a theoretical level [2]. This led 
to research efforts in exploring the utilization of quantum 
mechanics in classical computing. 
Han and Kim were among the pioneers giving name to 
quantum-inspired algorithms, and proposed the ���quantum- 
inspired evolutionary algorithm��� (QIEA). Extending upon 
prior works [13], [14], QIEAs describe evolutionary algo- 
rithms that are inspired by quantum mechanical concepts, 
specif i cally employing ���Q-bits��� and ���Q-gates��� to model 
populations and evolutionary processes [15]. These are the 
classical analogues of quantum qubits and quantum gates; 
Q-bits serve as probabilistic representations that maintain 
population diversity among individuals through the linear 
superposition of states, while Q-gates act as variational 
operators, driving individuals towards an optimal solution 
by modifying the probability distributions associated with 
Q-bits. Since these operate on classical computers, quantum 
phenomena is not observed, e.g. state collapse does not 
occur when the Q-bit state is ���measured���. Nevertheless, 
signif i cant performance improvements were observed when 
compared to its classical counterpart, highlighting the bene- 
i ts of using quantum-inspired methods. 
QIEAs form a subset of quantum-inspired metaheuris- 
tics, which are optimization techniques developed for i nd- 
ing approximate or near-optimal solutions inspired by 
quantum mechanics principles but are implemented on 
classical computers. This research area has experienced sig- 
nif i cant success in recent decades with various gains in per- 
formances [16], [17], [18], [19]. Quantum-inspired Genetic 
Algorithms (QGA) [13], [20] also belong to this category, 
employing Q-bits for probabilistic solution encoding and 
Q-gates for genetic operations like crossover and mutation. 
These features enable QGAs to maintain greater population 
diversity [15]. Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimiza- 
tion (QPSO) [21] represents particles as Q-bits, allowing for 
a probabilistic representation of the solution space instead 
of i xed positions and velocities. By maintaining particles 
in a superposition of states, the search space diversity and 
exploration capabilities are enhanced. Similarly, quantum- 
inspired ant colony optimization (QACO) [22] utilizes Q- 
bits and Q-gates to improve the classical ACO���s pheromone 
update mechanism. The traversal of the solution space via 
these mechanisms has been shown to augment exploration 
and exploitation capabilities [23], [24]. Quantum Simulated 
Annealing (QSA) [25] employs Monte Carlo methods to 
eff i ciently simulate classical annealing processes. Additional 
quantum concepts are also utilized, such as quantum ran- 
dom walks for eff i cient exploration of the energy landscape, 
quantum phase estimation for optimizing the annealing 
schedule, and quantum tunneling to escape local minima. 
Artif i cial intelligence methods have also benef i ted from 
quantum concepts. Menneer et al. [26] investigated a neural 
network training method inspired by the ���many universes��� 
interpretation of quantum behaviour. The authors trained 
multiple single-layer networks on individual patterns and 
derived a quantum network with weights calculated as 
a superposition of the individual network weights. This 
technique demonstrated increased eff i ciency compared to 
classical models and potentially provided a more accurate 
representation of human cognitive processes.

It is important to note that the research goals in devel- 
oping quantum-inspired methods can vary. Typically, the 
objectives include achieving faster and more stable conver- 
gence, enhancing the effectiveness of the solution search, or 
a combination of both [27]. 
Some works also introduce unique additions to their 
specif i cation of ���quantum-inspired���. Moore and Narayanan 
[11] further characterised quantum-inspired computing al- 
gorithms by stipulating that their output need only be 
verif i ed by classical computing methods, and not requiring 
a quantum computer for the task. Manju and Nigam [17] 
constrain quantum-inspired computing to methods for solv- 
ing engineering problems with cyclic or recurrent behavior. 
Further, some studies emphasize the use of quantum bits or 
Q-bits as the def i ning aspect of being quantum-inspired [27], 
[28], while others characterise different quantum concepts 
to be the core underpinning of the ���quantum inspired��� 
def i nition. 
These minor distinctions in def i ning ���quantum inspired��� 
do not signif i cantly impact the overall understanding of 
the term, as the core concept remains consistent with the 
generalization outlined earlier. 
2.2���Machine Learning��� 
Machine learning, as a i eld, has evolved signif i cantly since 
its inception, with its def i nition and scope adapting to ref l ect 
advancements in techniques and computational capabili- 
ties. Initially conceptualized in the 1950s as the concept 
of ���programming computers to learn from experience��� by 
Arthur Samuel [29], machine learning has witnessed several 
transformative milestones. Throughout these developments, 
the core idea of learning from data to make predictions 
or decisions has persisted, although the specif i c models, 
techniques, and learning paradigms have diversif i ed over 
time. Several foundational def i nitions of machine learning 
have been offered, each emphasizing various aspects of 
what constitutes the i eld. For example, [30] highlights 
the importance of learning from experience and improving 
performance over time, thus underscoring the iterative and 
adaptive nature of machine learning. Goodfellow et al. [31] 
position machine learning as a sub-f i eld of artif i cial intel- 
ligence, concerned with building algorithms that rely on a 
collection of examples of some phenomenon to be useful. 
A few authors def i ne machine learning rather as a broad 
collection of algorithms that learn patterns over feature 
spaces [32], [33]. Clear commonalities have been agreed 
upon, such as the importance of learning from patterns 
inherent within data [30], [31] via automatic processes [32], 
[34] without explicit programming [35], and the ability to 
improve performance based on the experience or data it is 
exposed to. While the specif i c techniques and approaches 
within machine learning have evolved and diversif i ed, its 
fundamental def i nition has remained consistently cohesive 
and integral to the i eld. 
2.3���Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning��� 
Both quantum computing and machine learning have 
gained tremendous popularity in the past couple of decades 
with signif i cant advances made compared to when they 
were i rst introduced. More recently, researchers have 
turned their attention to an inner subset at the intersection of 
these i elds; ���quantum-inspired machine learning��� (QiML). 
The interpretation of this term by researchers, however, has 
varied signif i cantly in the literature. Hence, this subsection 
aims to explore different perspectives and approaches taken 
by researchers in their attempts to def i ne ���quantum-inspired 
machine learning,��� shedding light on the nuances and chal- 
lenges involved in characterizing this rapidly developing 
i eld. We will thus also argue for a concrete description of 
the quantum-inspired machine learning term, which will 
better promote clarity, and assist in characterizing method- 
ologies within this, and related domains. 
The terms ���quantum-inspired���, or ���quantum-like��� ma- 
chine learning have, in early reviews, focused on describing 
optimization techniques inspired by quantum phenomena, 
and run on classical computers [33], likely in the absence 
of parameterized, iterative pattern recognition models more 
akin to classical machine learning methods. Other authors 
have corroborated this idea, with more explicit mention 
of machine learning rather than optimization [6], [7], [9], 
[10]. These def i nitions are consistent with the expected 
combination of the individual terms ���quantum-inspired��� 
and ���machine learning���. In recent years, the umbrella of 
QiML has been extended to include tensor network ma- 
chine learning models that parallel classical methodologies 
[36], [37], as well as ���dequantized��� algorithms, which aim 
to develop classical analogs of quantum algorithms with 
comparable computational advantages [4]. Although ten- 
sor network techniques agree with the concept of quan- 
tum inspiration (given that tensor decompositions aspire to 
model complex quantum wave functions), the classif i cation 
of dequantized algorithms as ���quantum-inspired��� may not 
wholly align with prevailing def i nitions of QiML. In the 
case of dequantized algorithms, the ���inspiration��� derives 
not from quantum mechanics itself but from the scrutiny of 
claims of quantum supremacy, or rather by the quantum 
algorithms themselves. In this sense, the relationship to 
quantum mechanics is indirect; the focus is on understand- 
ing the potential of quantum algorithms in classical settings. 
While the prevailing def i nitions of QiML offer some l ex- 
ibility and accommodate a variety of quantum applications 
to machine learning, they may also inadvertently lead to 
imprecise categorizations. Notably, certain techniques might 
be labeled as QiML when they may not accurately belong 
to this domain. Consider, for example, a quantum kernel 
used in a quantum support vector machine or a quantum 
variational circuit, methods typically relying on quantum 
circuit implementation, that has been simulated on classical 
hardware, as in [38], [39] using tools like Qiskit [40] or 
Pennylane [41]. These algorithms are now implemented on 
classical hardware and do not necessarily require quantum 
hardware, yet are often considered part of the broader 
quantum machine learning (QML) context, not QiML. The 
main reason for this distinction is not immediately clear, but 
may be related to the nature of the algorithms themselves, 
and that quantum circuit implementations have been col- 
loquial considered as QML, regardless of implementation 
device. Another explanation could be tied to the eff i ciency of 
implementation: if the translation of a quantum computing 
process to a classical setting is not intrinsically eff i cient, 
regardless of the circuit or input size, and does not scale

We classify works in QiML based on their underlying 
methodologies and purposes. Three overarching categories 
have been identif i ed: ���Dequantized Algorithms��� (Section 
4.1), ���Tensor Networks��� (Section 4.2), and ���Quantum Vari- 
ational Algorithm Simulation��� (Section 4.3). Methods that 
do not fail into these categories are group and labeled 
as ���Other QiML Methods��� (Section 4.4). Within each cate- 
gory, methods can be further grouped by their application 
domains, with the exception of Dequantized Algorithms, 
which are grouped via method due to lack of practical 
application domains. Figure 3 presents these categorizations 
in an organizational chart. 
4.1Dequantized Algorithms 
Inrecentyears,algorithmstermedas���dequantized��� 
have been developed. These algorithms aim to determine 
whether the speedups claimed by quantum machine learn- 
ing algorithms are genuinely attributed to the inherent 
power of quantum computation or are merely a byproduct 
of strong assumptions regarding input and output encod- 
ing/decoding (i.e. via state preparation). By scrutinizing 
these assumptions and their implications, researchers can 
more accurately assess the practicality of quantum algo- 
rithms and identify potential drawbacks that may impede 
their real-world applications. This line of inquiry has lead to 
the identif i cation of classical counterparts to quantum-based 
machine learning methods, which can be implemented on 
classical hardware and achieve performance levels compa- 
rable to their quantum analogs. By designing algorithms 
that can be eff i ciently executed on classical resources, the 
costly and arguably impractical requirements for quantum 
state preparation and hardware can both be circumvented 
[43]. Ewin Tang presented the seminal work in this area in 
2019 [44]. In an attempt to prove that no classical algorithm 
could match the runtime of the quantum recommendation 
system developed by Kerenidis and Prakash [45], the au- 
thor was instead able to devise a classical algorithm that 
matched the fast runtime. The classical algorithm ran in 
timeO(poly(k)log(mn)), only polynomially slower than the 
quantum algorithm���sO(poly(k)polylog(mn)), thus there is 
no quantum advantage observed. This was a signif i cant 
result, as this quantum algorithm was once thought to be 
one of the most promising candidates for demonstrably 
exponential improvements in quantum machine learning 
[3]. The key observation is that the exponential speedup 
achieved by the quantum algorithm relies on specif i c in- 
put assumptions about the user-product preference matrix. 
These were, in general, the prevailing assumptions for 
many quantum machine learning algorithms at the time; 
that either computing the corresponding quantum state|v��� 
from some input vectorvis arbitrarily fast, or that the 
necessary quantum states come into the system already 
prepared. However, the author emphasizes that the cost of 
state preparation is nontrivial; if state preparation cannot 
be performed in poly-logarithmic time, then the claimed 
exponential speedup of the associated quantum algorithm 
can not be realized in practice, as it does not account for the 
time constraints imposed by state preparation. 
The quantum recommendation system by Kerenidis and 
Prakash [45] describes an explicit data structure used to 
quickly prepare quantum states, as seen in Figure 4. This 
is implemented via a set of binary search trees, one for 
each row (user) in the preference matrix. Quantum states 
are encoded using the square amplitudes of the coeff i- 
cients of the given row vector|v���in 
a hierarchical manner: 
|v��� = Pn 
i=1vi|i��� forv ���Cn. 
The amplitudes and signs 
are stored as leaf nodes in the tree; the root node contains 
���v���2. 
This structure can be seen as a classical analogue to 
QRAM 1. Sampling from this requires randomly traversing 
down through each subsequent child node with probability 
proportional to its weight. This data structure allows for 
O(log(mn))query access, as well as timeO(log2(mn))for 
online updates to preference matrix elementsAij. However, 
the model assumes quantum access to this data structure 
with prepared quantum states. Tang demonstrated that 
this data structure employed to meet the state preparation 
assumptions can also fulf i ll classical L2-norm sampling 
assumptions, allowing for ���sample and query��� access (SQ 
1. We disregard the exact notion of QRAM for quantum settings, 
as the data structure is only interfaced with classically; no quantum 
operations are involved.

access) to the data. As a result, a classical algorithm aiming 
to ���equal��� the performance of the quantum algorithm can 
take advantage of these assumptions. In this way, more 
reasonable comparisons can be made between QML al- 
gorithms with state preparation assumptions and classical 
counterparts with sampling assumptions. 
Specif i cally, SQ access tox���SQ(x)is possible if, in 
timeO(T), the given data structure supports the following 
operations: 
���Sample: sample thei-th entry fromxwith probability 
x2 i/���x��� 
���Query: output entriesxi(i ��� [n]) ofx, and; 
���Norm: determine the L2-norm���x���. 
A data structure only supporting query operations overx 
will be denoted asQ(x). These assumptions serve as the 
classical analogue to quantum state preparation, and are 
often easier to satisfy. 
This work also introduces three dequantized linear alge- 
bra protocols, which have been widely used by subsequent 
studies to dequantize various machine learning techniques. 
Protocol 1: Inner Product Estimation (from Proposition 
4.2 in [44]): Forx,y ���CngivenSQ(x)andQ(y), the 
inner product���x|y���can 
be approximated with an additive 
error of���x������y�����, 
and a probability of at least1 ��� ��, 
using 
O(1/��2log(1/��))queries and samples.

sition 4.3 in [44]): Forw ���CkandV ���Cn��k,

The survey classifies works in Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning (QiML) into different categories based on their methodologies and purposes. The survey identifies three primary categories: "Dequantized Algorithms," "Tensor Networks," and "Quantum Variational Algorithm Simulation." These categories are further organized by their application domains, with "Other QiML Methods" encompassing those that don't fit into the main categories. An organizational chart depicting these categorizations is provided.
The "Dequantized Algorithms" category involves algorithms that investigate whether claimed quantum machine learning speedups are due to quantum computation itself or to specific input and output encoding assumptions. Researchers in this category aim to identify classical counterparts to quantum algorithms that can achieve comparable performance without the need for quantum hardware or state preparation.
One prominent work in this category is Ewin Tang's exploration of dequantized algorithms. Tang developed classical algorithms that matched the runtime of a quantum recommendation system. He demonstrated that exponential quantum speedups can be attributed to specific input assumptions, and if state preparation is time-consuming, the claimed advantages may not hold in practice. Tang introduced dequantized linear algebra protocols that have since been widely used to dequantize various machine learning techniques. These protocols include inner product estimation and "thin-matrix" multiplication.
Overall, the survey provides insights into how QiML is categorized based on methodologies and explores the "Dequantized Algorithms" category in detail, showcasing Ewin Tang's work and its implications.

Thank you for providing more context. It sounds like Figure 4 illustrates a QRAM-like Data Structure for a matrix A ��� C2x4. This figure shows a tree structure generated by a specific element within the matrix. The element is represented as a circle (���) in the second row and third column of the matrix A. The tree structure represents a sampling process, and nodes in the tree correspond to elements of the matrix. Traversing down the tree is based on L2-norm probability. The terminating nodes of the tree contain the sign of each element A(i, j).
The blue highlighting in the example for A(2,3) indicates that a specific path in the tree is being highlighted for the purpose of illustrating how sampling works. The probability of sampling the element A(2,3) is calculated as ���a2���^2 / ���A���^2 times the square of the absolute value of A(2,3).

4.1.2Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction 
Following their work in [44], Tang further went on to 
dequantize both quantum supervised clustering and prin- 
ciple component analysis (PCA) [49]. In that work, the 
dequantization model (SQ access input model with L2- 
norm sampling assumptions) is formalised, which directly 
comes from the prior work on the recommendation systems 
problem: 
A quantum protocol���s S: O(T)-time state preparation of 
|��1���,...,|��c��� ��� |�����is ���dequantized��� if a classical algorithm 
of the form CS: O(T)-timeSQ(��1,...,��c) ��� SQv(��)can 
be 
described with similar guarantees to S up to polynomial slowdown 
[49]. Under this framework, only a quadratic speedup (due 
to amplitude amplif i cation) is observed by the quantum 
nearest-centroid supervised clustering method proposed in 
[50], which aims to i nd the distance from a pointu ���Cn 
to the centroid of a cluster of points given byV ���Cmxn 
(and let �� 
VbeVwith unit normalized rows). Assuming SQ 
access to bothuand rows ofV, the problem reduces to 
approximating���Mw���, 
where: 
M := ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� 
u/���u��� 
1 
���n��V 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� 
andw := ? ���u��� ��� 
1 
���n��V ? 
(3) 
At this point, the quantum version will perform a swap test 
to construct|wM���. 
This can be effectively dequantized by 
reformulating���Mw���intow���M���Mw, 
which can be given 
as the inner product���a|b���of

Then, givenSQ(a)and using Protocol 1, the desired 
approximation is achieved inO(T(���w���2/��2)log(1/��))time. 
The Quantum Principle Component Analysis (QPCA) 
method [51] was dequantized via a similar methodology 
to that in [44], since the low rank approximation effec- 
tively produces a dimensionality reduction of the given 
matrix. In QPCA, the algorithm outputs estimates for both 
the top-ksingular values�� ��2 1,..., �� ��2k and singular vectors 
|�� v2 1���,...,|�� v2k���, 
using density matrix exponentiation to i nd 
these principal components. The dequantized version uses 
Protocol 3 to i ndSQ(S,��U,����)and produces the approx- 
imate large singular vectors �� 
V := S�����U�������1. The��i���s are 
taken from��, and thevi���s are given implicitly:�� vi=

in [49] for supervised clustering were reproduced, and

4.1.3Matrix Inversion and Solving Linear Systems 
The task of matrix inversion is an essential subroutine in 
many machine learning optimization operations. Solving 
the linear systemAx = bfor someA ���Rm��ntypically 
requires solving the pseudoinverse ofA:�� x = A+b(f i nding 
an�� xminimizing���Ax ��� b���whenAis not invertible). In 
classical settings, computing the pseudoinverse can be com- 
putationally diff i cult, especially for large or ill-conditioned 
matrices. Known methods of doing so, such as the Moore- 
Penrose pseudoinverse, may take, at worst, close toO(n3) 
time (wherem ��� n,m < n) 
[52]; a severe bottleneck 
in large data applications [53]. In the quantum setting, 
matrix inversion is performed using the famed HHL algo- 
rithm [54]. Dequantizing this in the sparse matrix inversion 
setting is generally diff i cult due to its BQP completeness 
[54]. However, many machine learning contexts operate in 
low rank settings, wherein which dequantization becomes 
possible, as demonstrated by the low-rank matrix inversion 
algorithms independently proposed by Gily�� en et al. [55] 
and Chia et al. [56]. These algorithms exploit the low- 
rank structure of the input matrix to perform the inversion 
eff i ciently using classical techniques. In [55] an exponential 
speed-up was shown to be possible for classical low-rank 
matrix inversion. GivenSQ(A)andSQ(b), both in constant 
time,SQ(A+b)is approximated in timeO(polylog(mn)), 
equivalent to the quantum version presented in [54], thus 
showing no quantum advantage. Specif i cally, the approxi- 
mation to�� xis given by:

It seems like you're providing a detailed overview of various dequantization methods applied to different machine learning tasks, particularly those involving matrices and linear algebra operations. These methods aim to dequantize quantum algorithms into classical algorithms with similar performance guarantees. The examples you mentioned include dequantizing quantum supervised clustering, principle component analysis (PCA), matrix inversion, and solving linear systems.
In the context of these methods:
Dequantization of quantum supervised clustering and PCA involves transforming quantum protocols into classical algorithms while maintaining similar performance guarantees, often achieving quadratic speedup due to amplitude amplification.
For quantum supervised clustering, the task is to find the distance from a point u ��� Cn to the centroid of a cluster given by matrix V ��� Cmxn. A classical algorithm approximates this using L2-norm sampling assumptions and a modified version of the swap test.
Quantum Principal Component Analysis (QPCA) was dequantized using a similar methodology to the one applied in previous works, resulting in dequantized approximations for singular values and vectors. This method effectively reduces the dimensionality of the input matrix.
Matrix inversion and solving linear systems are fundamental tasks in machine learning optimization. While the quantum HHL algorithm is challenging to dequantize due to its BQP completeness, algorithms for low-rank matrix inversion have been developed, taking advantage of the low-rank structure to achieve efficient inversion.
Your description provides a comprehensive overview of these dequantization approaches and how they can be applied to various machine learning tasks. If you have any specific questions or if you'd like to delve deeper into any aspect, feel free to ask!

4.2Tensor Networks 
A large focus in QiML research in the current day has been 
on the use of tensor networks (TNs) as a machine learning 
models. QiML-based tensor network research benef i ts from 
a rich body of prior knowledge5in the classical context, both 
in and out of the machine learning i eld; theory and practical 
applications show a useful degree of transferability into the 
quantum domain [81], [82]. A key motivator in the use of 
TNs is their ability to classically simulate the many-body 
quantum wave function eff i ciently, which has been shown to 
be consistent with higher-order tensor representations [77]. 
Hamiltonians of many physically realistic systems tend to 
exhibit strong locality; the interactions between constituent

analyzed in the literature outside of the machine learning context, 
with a multitude of informative, introductory materials available on 
the topic [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80].

particles are limited to next or nearest neighbors [83]. In the 
case of gapped, local Hamiltonians, the exponentially large 
and intractable Hilbert space is constrained to low energy 
states bounded by the entanglement area-law, i.e., these 
states cannot be highly entangled [83]. This constricts the 
exploration space to only a relevant fraction of the Hilbert 
space. When modelled by tensor networks, approximating 
this subset can be done in polynomial time [75]. 
Further, tensor networks form a bridge between classical 
neural network methods and quantum computing. Several 
works have identif i ed the natural corollary of tensor net- 
works to quantum circuits, where many tensor networks 
have a direct quantum circuit translation [77], [81]. Com- 
plex tensors under tensor network decomposition are rep- 
resented as unitary gates; the bond dimension connecting 
two nodes of the tensor network is determined by number 
of qubits connecting two sequential unitaries in the circuit. 
It is shown that qubit-eff i cient tree tensor network (TTN) 
and matrix product state (MPS) models can be devised, 
with logarithmic scaling in the number of physical (O(1), 
independent of the input data size) and ancilla (O(log2D)in 
bond dimensionD) qubits required [84]. This allows tensor 
networks to express higher order feature spaces in classical 
settings, and act as classical simulators for quantum circuits. 
Several works have since successfully implemented tensor 
networks as parameterized quantum circuits on small, near- 
term quantum devices for machine learning tasks, with 
many of the advancements in the classical setting being 
readily transferred to the quantum domain [84], [85], [86], 
[87]. The many-body quantum system ofNparticles can be 
described as follows: 
|����� = X 
s1s2������sN ��s1s2������sN|s1s2������sN���(14) 
where, in quantum computing, the quantum state ofN 
qubits|�����with amplitude��s1s2s3������sNis a composition 
of thesNsingle-qubit basis states. This can be effectively 
considered as one, large tensor. TNs aim to i nd alternative 
representations of this computationally-ineff i cient descrip- 
tion by reducing the complexity of the system. This is 
achieved by decomposing the large tensor into a network 
of many smaller tensors of smaller rank. The total num- 
ber of parameters in the i nal representation scales sub- 
exponentially with the number of composite tensors and 
the bond dimension (the dimension of the largest contracted 
15 
index within the tensor network) between them, which al- 
lows for the classical computation of expectation values [75]. 
For example, a tensor withNindices, each of dimensiond, 
must generally be specif i ed bydNparameters. In contrast, 
the MPS representation of such a tensor with bond dimen- 
sionmonly requiresNdm2parameters, which now scales 
linearly withN. Various such methods of tensor network 
decomposition exist, which depend on the properties of the 
original tensor and the desired resulting network. In further 
sections, we discuss relevant tensor network methods and 
their application as QiML techniques.

4.2.1Matrix Product States 
Matrix Product States (MPS), or Tensor Train Networks, are 
widely used for the eff i cient representation of 1D gapped 
quantum systems with low energy states [89]. In fact, any 
such quantum state can be exactly represented by the MPS 
structure eff i ciently [90]. The MPS is achieved through 
the decomposition of the quantum state into a product of 
smaller matrices which represent the constituent tensors. 
A general process involves successively partitioning away 
individual tensors from the rest of the system via the sin- 
gular value decomposition (SVD) [78]; several other related 
methods have been also been proposed for performing this 
decomposition in a practical manner [91]. By considering 
only relevant states with bounded entanglement, a com- 
pressed form is obtainable by truncating the least relevant 
singular values. This low rank approximation is what drives 
the eff i cient representation of the quantum state by the MPS, 
which would otherwise be described exponentially with an 
n-qubit state. 
Supervised Tensor Network Modeling: The i rst notable 
instance of tensor networks being used as machine learning 
models utilize the MPS decomposition. Stoudenmire and 
Schwab [92] demonstrated their capabilties in parameter- 
ized supervised learning. They note that handling high- 
dimensional vectors is also a critical challenge in non-linear 
kernel learning. Traditional approaches often rely on the 
���kernel trick��� [93] to solve the dual representation; instead 
the authors advocated for applying tensor network de- 
compositions. In their proposed model, the kernel learning 
problem is expressed as:

ized supervised learning. They note that handling high- 
dimensional vectors is also a critical challenge in non-linear 
kernel learning. Traditional approaches often rely on the 
���kernel trick��� [93] to solve the dual representation; instead 
the authors advocated for applying tensor network de- 
compositions. In their proposed model, the kernel learning 
problem is expressed as: 
fl(x) = Wl�� ��(x).(15) 
Here, vectorsxare mapped to a high-dimensional feature 
space through a non-linear mapping��(x), withWlas the 
weight matrix;lis a tensor index for the functionfl(x)that 
maps everyxto the space of classif i cation labels. BothW 
and��(x)could be considerably large, which presents large 
computational bottleneck scaling exponentially with their 
size; i.e. the resulting Hilbert space of��(x)is2N, and neces- 
sitates a compatibly sizedW. An MPS tensor decomposition 
is thus leveraged to reduce this computational complexity. 
By representingWvia an MPS and optimizing it directly, 
the model scales linearly with the training set size. An MPS 
decomposition can derived fromWl: 
Wl 
s1s2...sN = X 
{a} 
A��1 
s1A 
��1��2 
s2 ������Al:��j��j+1 
sj ������A��N���1 
sN ,(16) 
where index��jis the bond dimension between sites.��(x) 
is obtained via an embedding scheme that converts classical 
input data into a linear combination of quantum states in 
an orthogonal basis. In [92], the quantum mapping function 
��(xj)is used to embed everyj-th gray-scale pixel value 
��(xj) = h 
cos ?�� 
2 xj ? 
,sin ?�� 
2 xj ?i 
(17) 
into the L2-normalized trigonometric basis. A full image is 
thus the tensor product of��(xj)individual local embed- 
dings over allNpixels: 
��(x) = ��(x1) ��� ��(x2) ��� ������ ��� ��(xN).(18) 
Words and sentences within natural language documents 
can be associated with quantum systems by building their 
vector and tensor space representations [94], [95], [96]. Each 
wordwiis mapped to anm-dimensional vector space, with 
each dimension representing a different semantic meaning. 
A word can thus be represented as a linear combination of 
these orthogonal semantic bases: 
wi= 
m X 
i=1 ��i|ei���,(19) 
where��iis the coeff i cient of thei-th base vectorei. A 
sentences = (wi,...,wn)or lengthncan then be modeled 
as a tensor product of the word vectors: 
s = w1��� ������ ��� wn 
= 
m X 
i,...,n=1 Ai,...,n(ei��� ������ ��� en), 
(20) 
withAbeing themn-dimensional coeff i cient tensor of basis 
states. 
A few other local embedding methods have been dis- 
cussed in the literature, including the polynomial basis [97]: 
��(xj) = [1,xj],(21) 
16 
which enables a transformed feature space capturing inter- 
actions within categorical data, and simplifying the interpre- 
tation of the resulting model as a high-degree polynomial. 
Other kernels that are the product of someNlocal kernels 
could also potentially be used [92]. 
A quadratic cost function: 
L =

NT X 
n=1 X 
l 
(y��� n��� f 
���(xn))2, (22) 
is optimized via a ���sweeping��� algorithm, inspired by the 
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm 
successfully used in physics applications [98]. This process 
essentially involves ���sweeping��� across the MPS (Matrix 
Product State), where only two adjacent MPS tensors are 
varied at a time. The tensors at sitesjandj+1are combined 
into a single bond tensorB���, followed by the calculation of 
the derivative of the cost function with respect to the bond 
tensor for a gradient descent step. The gradient update to 
the tensorB���can be computed as: 
���B���= ��� 
���L 
���B���

NT X 
n=1 ? 
y��� n��� f ���(xn)?�� 
��n,(23) 
where �� 
��nis the projection of the input via the contrac- 
tion of the ���outer ends��� of the MPS that do not include 
B���.B���is then replaced by the updated bond tensor: 
B ������ = B���+ �����B���, where��is a scalar value that con- 
trols convergence. This can then be decomposed back into 
separate MPS tensors using a singular value decomposition 
(SVD), which assists in adapting the MPS bond dimension. 
The singular value matrixScan then be absorbed into the 
right singular vector matrix, resulting in the updated sites 
A���sj= UsjandA������ 
sj+1 = SV ��� 
sj+1. The MPS form is restored, 
with the���indexing moving to thej + 1site. The process 
then iteratively continues to the nextj +1andj +2tensors 
and returning through the opposite direction when an end 
node is reached for a predetermined number of ���sweeps���. A 
major advantage to this is that the resulting bond dimension 
can be chosen adaptively based on number of large singular 
values. This l exibility allows the MPS form ofWto undergo 
maximum possible compression; the degree of compression 
can vary for each bond, while still ensuring an optimal 
decision function. Inference is performed by successively 
contracting the network until the valuefl(x)is obtained, 
where the classif i cationlis determined by the largest|fl(x)|. 
While the DMRG sweeping method has seen success 
in several works, gradient descent based methods can be 
used to directly optimize tensor networks [97], [99], [100], 
[101]. This is i rst noted by Novikov et al. [97] who de- 
veloped parameterizing supervised learning models with 
MPS in parallel with the work in [92]. Gradient descent 
based approaches for minimizing the cost function incurs 
an increased bond dimension after each iteration, which 
[92] handles via successive SVD operations to reduce the 
rank. To avoid the bond dimension growth, a stochastic 
Riemannian optimization procedure is used instead, with 
the addition of a bond dimension regularisation term in the 
cost function. The polynomial basis (Equation 21) was used 
as the local feature mapping.

Efthymiou et al. [99] similarly provide an implemen- 
tation using automatic gradients for optimization, rather 
than DMRG. The results show strong performance over 
benchmark image classif i cation tasks.

4.2.2Tree-Tensor Networks/MERA 
Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) (also called the Hierarchical 
Tucker decomposition [79]) are a tensor network structure 
where the tensors are arranged hierarchically, often forming 
a binary tree structure [108]. TTNs exhibit advantages in 
computational eff i ciency compared with other tensor net- 
work forms, which stems from the tree structure that avoids 
loops in the network, enabling eff i cient and exact contrac- 
tion. The Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz 
(MERA) is a particular type of TTN, which is specif i cally 
designed to eff i ciently represent quantum states with long- 
range correlations [109] due to its incorporation of disentan- 
glers and isomorphisms in its network structure, accounting 
for and managing entanglement at different length scales. 
This makes it particularly suitable for representing ground 
states of critical systems or systems with power-law decay 
of correlations. While not as general as PEPS or MPS, TTNs 
and MERA offer advantages in specif i c contexts where their 
structure aligns with the physical system. 
The mathematical form of the TTN varies based on 
the compositional structure, dependant on the number of 
layers, the number of tensors, and the contraction of those 
tensors within those layers. The contractions are often de- 
i ned recursively. An example is given in Equation 26 for 
the construction of a binary TTN, with each tensor node 
connected to two children: 
W = X 
{��} 
A[1] 
��2,��3 
N Y 
n=2 
A[n] 
��n,��2n,��2n+1, (26) 
where tensorA[1]is the root tensor, with subsequentA[n] 
children overNtotal layers [110]. Similar to the MPS, 
the TTN can be trained via DMRG and gradient-based 
optimization. Predicting an output is then given by the 
contraction: | �� pn��� = W����� ��(xn).(27) 
In addition to gradient-descent based optimization used 
in the MPS, a MERA-like training process has also been 
proposed [111]. The cost function to be minimized is chosen 
as: f = ��� 
N X 
n=1 ���pn| �� pn���,(28) 
withNas the total number of samples. This cost can 
be reduced by imposing unitary constraints on all tensors 
Aof the TTN such thatA���A = I, inducing the whole 
transformation as a unitary:W���W = I. Thus the simplif i ed 
cost function becomes: 
f = 
N X 
n=1 ? �����(xn)|WW���|��(xn)��� ��� 2�����(xn)|W |pn��� + 1 ? 
= 
N X 
n=1 �����(xn)|W |pn���, (29) 
and is shown to reduce the complexity of optimization. Over 
the task of Modif i ed National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (MNIST) [112] image classif i cation in [111], this 
learning method exhibited relatively small entanglement be- 
tween classif i cation states, meaning that the TTN eff i ciently 
represents the MNIST dataset; a conjecture that may extend 
over classical images in general. 
2D hierarchical structures have also been proposed for 
generative modeling as a direct extension of the MPS ver- 
sion in [104], where the modeling of 2D images can be 
directly achieved [110]. This was shown to overcome the 
issue of exponential decay of correlations in MPS, making 
it more effective in capturing long-range correlations and 
perform better for large-size images. 
TTNs have been used as a means of coarse-grained 
unsupervised feature extraction in [88]. The model prepares 
quantum states from classical input and feeds them into a 
1D TTN. Optimal weightsWare computed from its left sin- 
gular vectorsWs= P

Since direct diagonalization of��is not feasible, the DMRG- 
like algorithm is employed to iteratively produce and diago- 
nalize reduced density matrices. This procedure is repeated 
log(N)times to produce a suitable approximation, leading 
to the diagonalizingUof isometry tensors, approximated 
as a layered TTN. To produce a classif i cation output, the 
reduced feature set is subsequently used in a supervised 
context, where the layers ofUare i xed and the top tensor 
is replaced with an MPS decomposition, optimized via 
DMRG.
