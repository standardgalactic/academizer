The delayed choice quantum eraser, debunked
[This is a transcript of the video embedded below. Some of the explanations may not make sense without the animations in the video.]



A lot of you have asked me to do a video about the delayed choice quantum eraser, an experiment that supposedly rewrites the past. I haven’t done that simply because there are already lots of videos about it, for example Matt from PBS Space-time, the always amazing Joe Scott, and recently also Don Lincoln from Fermilab. And how many videos do you really need about the same thing if that thing isn’t a kitten in a box. However, having watched all those gentlemen’s videos about quantum erasing, I think they’re all wrong. The quantum eraser isn’t remotely as weird as you think, doesn’t actually erase anything, and certainly doesn’t rewrite the past. And that’s what we’ll talk about today.

Let’s start with a puzzle that has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. Peter is forty-six years old and he’s captain of a container ship. He ships goods between two places that are 100 kilometers apart, let’s call them A and B. He starts his round trip at A with the ship only half full. Three-quarters of the way to B he adds more containers to fill the ship, which slows him down by a factor of two. On the return trip, his ship is empty. How old is the captain?

If you don’t know the answer, let’s rewind this question to the beginning.

Peter is forty-six years old. The answer’s right there. Everything I told you after that was completely unnecessary and just there to confuse you. The quantum eraser is a puzzle just like this.

The quantum eraser is an experiment that combines two quantum effects, interference and entanglement. Interference of quantum particles can itself be tested by the double slit experiment. For the double slit experiment you shoot a coherent beam of particles at a plate with two thin openings, that’s the double slit. On the screen behind it, you then observe several lines, usually five or seven, but not two. This is an interference pattern created by overlapping waves. When a crest meets a trough, the waves cancel and that makes a dark spot on the screen. When crest meets crest they add up and that makes a bright spot.

The amazing thing about the double slit is that you get this pattern even if you let only one particle at a time pass through the slits. This means that even single particles act like waves. We therefore describe quantum particles with a wave-function, usually denoted psi. The interesting thing about the double-slit experiment is that if you measure which slit the particles go through, the interference pattern disappears. Instead the particles behave like particles again and you get two blobs, one from each of the slits.

Well, actually you don’t. Though you’ve almost certainly seen that elsewhere. Just because you know which slit the wave-function goes through doesn’t mean it stops being a wave-function. It’s just no longer a wave-function going through two slits. It’s now a wave-function going through only one slit, so you get a one-slit diffraction pattern. What’s that? That’s also an interference pattern but a fuzzier one and indeed looks mostly like a blob. But a very blurry blob. And if you add the blobs from the two individual slits, they’ll overlap and still pretty much look like one blob. Not, as you see in many videos two cleanly separated ones.

You may think this is nitpicking, but it’ll be relevant to understanding the quantum eraser, so keep this in mind. It’s not so relevant for the double slit experiment, because regardless of whether you think it’s one blob or two, the sum of the images from both separate slits is not the image you get from both slits together. The double slit experiment therefore shows that in quantum mechanics, the result of a measurement depends on what you measure. Yes, that’s weird.

The other ingredient that you need for the quantum eraser is entanglement. I have talked about entanglement several times previously, so let me just briefly remind you: entangled particles share some information, but you don’t know which particle has which share until you measure it. It could be for example that you know the particles have a total spin of zero, but you don’t know the spin of each individual particle. Entangled particles are handy because they allow you to measure quantum effects over large distances which makes them super extra weird.

Okay, now to the quantum eraser. You take your beam of particles, usually photons, and direct it at the double slit. After the double slit you place a crystal that converts each single photon into a pair of entangled photons. From each pair you take one and direct it onto a screen. There you measure whether they interfere. I have drawn the photons which come from the two different places in the crystal with two different colors. But this is just so it’s easier to see what’s going on, these photons actually have the same color.

If you create these entangled pairs after the double slit, then the wave-function of the photon depends on which slit the photons went through. This information comes from the location where the pairs were created and is usually called the “which way information”. Because of this which-way information, the photons on the screen can’t create an interference pattern.

What’s with the other side of the entangled particles? That’s where things get tricky. On the other side, you measure the particles in two different ways. In the first case, you measure the which-way information directly, so you have two detectors, let’s call them D1 and D2. The first detector is on the path of the photons from the left slit, the second detector on the path of the photons from the right slit. If you measure the photons with detectors D1 and D2, you see no interference pattern.

But alternatively you can turn off the first two detectors, and instead combine the two beams in two different ways. These two white bars are mirrors and just redirect the beam. The semi-transparent one is a beam splitter. This means half of the photons go through, and the other half is reflected. This looks a little confusing but the point is just that you combine the two beams so that you no longer know which way the photon came. This is the “erasure” of the “which way information”. And then you measure those combined beams in detectors D3 and D4. A measurement on one of those two detectors does not tell you which slit the photon went through.

Finally, you measure the distribution of photons on the screen that are entangled partners of those photons that went to D3. These photons create an interference pattern. You can alternatively measure the distribution of photons on the screen that are partner particles of those photons that went to D4. Those will also create an interference pattern.

This is the “quantum erasure”. It seems you’ve managed to get rid of the which way information by combining those paths, and that restores the interference pattern. In the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment, the erasure happens well after the entangled partner particle hit the screen. This is fairly easy to do just by making the paths of those photons long enough.

If you watch the other videos about this experiment on YouTube, they’ll now go on to explain that this seems to imply that the choice of what you measure on the one side of the experiment decides what happened on the other side before you even made that choice. Because the photons must have known whether to interfere or not before you decided whether to erase the which-way information. But this is clearly nonsense. Because, let’s rewind this explanation to the beginning.

The photons on the screen can’t create an interference pattern. Everything I told you after this is completely irrelevant. It doesn’t matter at all what you do on the other side of the experiment. The photons on the screen will always create the same pattern. And it’ll never be an interference pattern.

Wait. Didn’t I just tell you that you do get an interference pattern if you use detectors D3 and D4? Indeed. But I’ve omitted a crucial part of the information which is missing in those other YouTube videos. It’s that those interference patterns are not the same. And if you add them, you get exactly the same as you get from detectors 1 and 2. Namely these two overlapping blurry blobs. This is why it matters that you know the combined pattern of two single slits doesn’t give you two separate blobs, as they normally show you.

What you actually do in the eraser experiment, is that you sample the photon pairs in two groups. And you do that in two different ways. If you use detector 1 and 2 you sample them so that the entangled partners on the screen do not create an interference pattern for each detector separately. If you use detector 3 and 4, they each separately create an interference pattern but together they don’t.

This means that the interference pattern really comes from selectively disregarding some of the particles. That this is possible has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. I could throw coins on the floor and then later decide to disregard some of those and create any kind of pattern. Clearly this doesn’t rewrite the past.

This by the way has nothing to do with the particular realization of the quantum eraser experiment that I’ve discussed. This experiment has been done in a number of different ways, but what I just told you is generally true, these interference patterns will always combine to give the original non-interference pattern.

This is not to say that there is nothing weird going on in this experiment. But what’s weird about it is the same thing that’s weird already about the normal double slit experiment. Namely, if you look at the wave-function of a single particle, then that distributes in space. Yet when you measure it, the particle is suddenly in one particular place, and the result must be correlated throughout space and fit to the measurement setting. I actually think the bomb experiment is far weirder than the quantum eraser. Check out my earlier video for more on that.

When I was working on this video I thought certainly someone must have explained this before. But the only person I could find who’d done that is… Sean Carroll in a blogpost two years ago. Yes, you can trust Sean with the quantum stuff. I’ll leave you a link to Sean’s piece in the info.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

experiment, often considered to have mind-bending implications, is debunked in this video. The video creator states that many other YouTubers have already covered the topic but argues that they are all wrong. The quantum eraser experiment combines interference and entanglement, two quantum effects. In the experiment, particles are sent through a double-slit and their interference pattern is observed on a screen. When the which-way information is known, the interference pattern disappears. The experiment then introduces entangled particles, where one photon from each entangled pair is directed at a screen to observe interference. On the other side, the which-way information can be measured directly or erased using beam splitters and mirrors. The video creator argues that regardless of what happens on the other side, the interference pattern on the screen remains the same. The experiment selectively disregards certain particles to create interference patterns, but this does not rewrite the past. The video concludes that the experiment is not as weird as it may seem and that the true strangeness lies in the nature of quantum mechanics itself.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

that explores the counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics, specifically the concept of wave-particle duality and the role of measurement in determining the behavior of quantum systems.</p><p>In the quantum eraser experiment, a beam of particles, often photons, is directed at a double-slit apparatus. When the particles pass through the double slits, they exhibit wave-like interference patterns on a screen behind the slits. This interference pattern occurs even when the particles are sent through the apparatus one at a time, indicating that individual particles can behave as waves.</p><p>However, when the which-path information of the particles is determined, such as by placing detectors near the slits to determine which slit each particle passes through, the interference pattern disappears. The particles behave as particles, creating two distinct blobs on the screen.</p><p>The interesting part comes with the concept of entanglement. In the quantum eraser experiment, pairs of entangled photons are created after the double slit. One photon from each entangled pair is directed to a screen to observe interference or non-interference patterns. The other photon is sent to a different setup.</p><p>In one measurement setup, the which-path information of the photons is directly measured, destroying the interference pattern on the screen. In this case, the entangled partner photons on the screen do not exhibit interference.</p><p>In the other measurement setup, instead of directly measuring the which-path information, the entangled photons are manipulated using beam splitters and mirrors to "erase" the which-path information. The interference pattern is restored on the screen, indicating that the erasure of the which-path information allows the entangled photons to exhibit interference.</p><p>The intriguing aspect is that the erasure of the which-path information can happen well after the entangled partner photons hit the screen, and the choice of whether to erase or measure the which-path information appears to affect the behavior of the photons retroactively. However, it's important to note that the interference or non-interference pattern on the screen is predetermined by the measurement setup, and the choice made on the other side does not change the past or rewrite history.</p><p>Quantum erasure experiments highlight the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, including wave-particle duality, superposition, entanglement, and the role of measurement in collapsing the wave function. They challenge our classical intuitions and demonstrate the non-local and probabilistic nature of quantum systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">distribution at the screen. According to textbook quantum mechanics that’s because the wave function collapsed when we measured it at the slits; according to Many-Worlds it’s because the electron became entangled with the measurement apparatus, decoherence occurred as the apparatus became entangled with the environment, and the wave function branched into separate worlds, in each of which the electron only passes through one of the slits.


An interference pattern is seen when electrons travel through two slits (left),
unless a detector measures which slit each electron goes through (right).
The new wrinkle is that we are still going to “measure” which slit the electron goes through, but instead of reading it out on a big macroscopic dial, we simply store that information in a single qubit. Say that for every “traveling” electron passing through the slits, we have a separate “recording” electron. The pair becomes entangled in the following way: if the traveling electron goes through the left slit, the recording electron is in a spin-up state (with respect to the vertical axis), and if the traveling electron goes through the right, the recording electron is spin-down. We end up with:

Ψ = (L)[↑] + (R)[↓].

Our professor, who is clearly in a bad mood, insists that we don’t actually measure the spin of our recording electrons, and we don’t even let them wander off and bump into other things in the room. We carefully trap them and preserve them, perhaps in a magnetic field.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

And, to be honest, there is a tradition in popular treatments of quantum mechanics to make things seem as mysterious as possible. Suggesting that time travel might be involved somehow is just throwing gasoline on the fire.

All of these temptations should be resisted. The electron is simply part of the wave function of the universe. It doesn’t make choices about whether to be wave-like or particle-like. But a number of serious researchers in quantum foundations really do take the delayed-choice quantum eraser and analogous experiments (which have been successfully performed, by the way) as evidence of retrocausality in nature — signals traveling backwards in time to influence the past. A form of this experiment was originally proposed by none other than John Wheeler, who envisioned a set of telescopes placed on the opposite side of the screen from the slits, which could detect which slit the electrons went through long after they had passed through. Unlike some later commentators, Wheeler didn’t go so far as to suggest retrocausality, and knew better than to insist that an electron is either a particle or a wave at all times.

There’s no need to invoke retrocausality to explain the delayed-choice experiment. To an Everettian, the result makes perfect sense without anything traveling backwards in time. The trickiness relies on the fact that by becoming entangled with a single recording spin rather than with the environment and its zillions of particles, the traveling electrons only became kind-of decohered. With just a single particle to worry about observing, we are allowed to contemplate measuring it in different ways. If, as in the conventional double- slit setup, we measured the slit through which the traveling electron went via a macroscopic pointing device, we would have had no choice about what was being observed. True decoherence takes a tiny quantum entanglement and amplifies it, effectively irreversibly, into the environment. In that sense the delayed-choice quantum eraser is a useful thought experiment to contemplate the role of decoherence and the environment in measurement.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between

quantum eraser experiment, there is a temptation to interpret the results in terms of retrocausality, suggesting that information travels backwards in time to influence the past behavior of particles. However, it is important to resist such interpretations as they can contribute to misconceptions and unnecessary mystification.</p><p>The electron in the experiment does not make conscious choices or have the ability to decide whether to exhibit wave-like or particle-like behavior. It is simply part of the wave function of the universe. While some researchers in quantum foundations have explored retrocausality as a potential explanation, it is not a necessary or widely accepted interpretation of the experiment.</p><p>John Wheeler, who originally proposed a similar experiment, did not suggest retrocausality and recognized that electrons exhibit both wave and particle behavior depending on the context. He did not claim that an electron must be exclusively a particle or a wave at all times.</p><p>The delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment can be understood without invoking retrocausality. From an Everettian perspective (associated with the Many-Worlds interpretation), the results make sense without resorting to information traveling backwards in time. The trickiness of the experiment lies in the entanglement between the traveling electron and a single recording spin rather than with the entire environment. This limited decoherence allows for the consideration of different measurement approaches. If a macroscopic pointing device were used to measure the electron's path, there would be no choice in what is being observed. The experiment offers insights into the role of decoherence and the environment in the measurement process.</p><p>Therefore, while the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment can raise intriguing questions about the nature of quantum mechanics and measurement, it does not necessitate retrocausality and can be understood within alternative interpretations, such as the Everettian perspective.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">But alas, not everyone is an Everettian. In some other versions of quantum mechanics, wave functions really do collapse, not just the apparent collapse that decoherence provides us with in Many-Worlds. In a true collapse theory like GRW, the process of wave- function collapse is asymmetric in time; wave functions collapse, but they don’t un- collapse. If you have collapsing wave functions, but for some reason also want to maintain an overall time-symmetry to the fundamental laws of physics, you can convince yourself that retrocausality needs to be part of the story.

Or you can accept the smooth evolution of the wave function, with branching rather than collapses, and maintain time-symmetry of the underlying equations without requiring backwards-propagating signals or electrons that can’t make up their mind.

different interpretations of quantum mechanics and how they handle wave function collapse. While the Many-Worlds interpretation, associated with Everettian views, suggests a smooth evolution of the wave function with branching and avoids the need for collapse, other interpretations, such as the GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber) theory, propose an asymmetrical collapse process that does not allow for wave function "un-collapse."</p><p>In theories that involve wave function collapse, maintaining time-symmetry while explaining the collapse process can lead some to consider retrocausality as part of the explanation. Retrocausality implies that information can travel backward in time, influencing past events. This perspective aims to preserve an overall time-symmetry within the fundamental laws of physics.</p><p>On the other hand, interpretations like Many-Worlds rely on the smooth evolution of the wave function and branching without invoking collapse. This approach maintains time-symmetry without the need for backward-propagating signals or particles that cannot make up their minds.</p><p>It's worth noting that the choice of interpretation in quantum mechanics remains an open and active area of research and debate. Different interpretations offer alternative ways of understanding and explaining the underlying principles of quantum mechanics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

quantum eraser experiment revolves around the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the implications of the experimental results. Here are the basic points of the argument:</p><ol><li><p>Double-Slit Experiment: The double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave-particle duality of quantum particles, such as electrons or photons. When particles pass through two slits, an interference pattern is observed on a screen, indicating their wave-like behavior. Even when particles are sent through the slits individually, they still create an interference pattern, suggesting that individual particles can exhibit wave-like characteristics.</p></li><li><p>Which-Path Information: If one tries to determine which path the particles take by introducing detectors or measurements at the slits, the interference pattern disappears. The act of measuring or obtaining the which-path information disrupts the wave-like behavior, and the particles behave more like distinct particles, creating two separate blobs on the screen instead of an interference pattern.</p></li><li><p>Entanglement and Quantum Eraser: The delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment introduces entanglement. Pairs of entangled photons are created after the double slit. One photon from each entangled pair is directed to a screen, and the other photon is manipulated and measured in different ways.</p></li><li><p>Wave-Particle Behavior: If the which-path information is measured directly, the entangled partner photons on the screen do not exhibit an interference pattern. However, if the which-path information is "erased" by manipulating the entangled photons, the interference pattern reappears.</p></li><li><p>Interpretation and Implications: The interpretation and implications of the experiment differ among various interpretations of quantum mechanics. Some argue that the results suggest retrocausality, where information travels backward in time to influence past events. This interpretation challenges our understanding of cause and effect. Others, such as Everettians (Many-Worlds interpretation), argue that the experiment can be understood without retrocausality, emphasizing the role of entanglement, decoherence, and the smooth evolution of the wave function.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the argument delves into the nature of quantum mechanics, measurement, wave-particle duality, and the role of observation or measurement in collapsing the wave function. Different interpretations offer various perspectives on the experimental results, with some suggesting retrocausality while others emphasize alternative explanations that maintain time-symmetry without invoking backward time-traveling effects.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I think we can give an example with a ping pong ball making machine, that makes red and blue balls alternatively.

A big ball has a macroscopic state, let’s say red or blue, that we can measure, without changing the state of the ball. So there is no difference between the state and the measured values. Nothing changes if we have two balls, their combined state would just be the enumeration of combinations of red and blue.

In quantum mechanics the state of a very small ball would be described by a linear combination alpha * &lt;blue&gt; + beta * &lt;red&gt;, with alpha and beta being complex numbers. But this state is not something that we, stupid humans, have direct access to. Instead we interfere with the state throug… (more)

There are no classical analogies that help to understand quantum entanglement, but you do need to realize that EVERYTHING YOU READ on the net about quantum entanglement is absolute horseshit. What you are actually reading about is just an ordinary quantum state containing two or more particles. That's all. That's all there is to it. It is totally standard quantum physics, circa 1925.

Why is quantum entanglement mysterious? I have two boxes, one with a black ball, one with white. I separate the two boxes. When I see the color of the ball in the first box, I know the color of the ball in the second box. Am I missing something?
Yes. This misses everything.

After John Bell published his inequality in the 1960s, he was faced with a huge range of misunderstandings. In order to clear up at least some of these, he published a follow-up paper with one of the more memorable titles in the foundations of physics:

Bertlmann’s socks and the Nature of Reality (Bell, 1981).

Reinhold Bertlmann was one of Bell’s colleagues at CERN. He is an expert on quantum field theory, and— more relevantly — he invariably wore odd socks.

Therefore, if one could catch a glimpse of just one of Bertlmann’s socks, and see that it was pink, one could ins… (more)</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

If someone else is using a similar analogy or discussing the same concept in the context of the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, it is not surprising. The analogy of the ping pong ball or box setup can be a helpful way to illustrate certain aspects of correlation and entanglement in quantum mechanics.</p><p>Analogies can be valuable tools for conveying complex ideas in a more intuitive manner. They allow us to relate unfamiliar concepts to familiar scenarios. So, it's not uncommon for different individuals to use similar analogies or thought experiments to explain or explore the same topic.</p><p>If you have any specific questions or would like further clarification on any aspect of the analogy or the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Here's a way to design a simplified analogy of a quantum erasure-like situation using ping pong balls:</p><ol><li><p>Setup: Start with two boxes, Box A and Box B, and collect ping pong balls in each box. Each box represents a different experimental path.</p></li><li><p>Ball Color and Recording: Assign a particular color, let's say red and blue, to the ping pong balls in Box A. Similarly, assign the opposite color to the balls in Box B. This assignment represents the "which-path" information.</p></li><li><p>Entanglement: Create an entangled pair of ping pong balls. One ball from the entangled pair is placed in Box A, while the corresponding entangled ball is placed in Box B. The entanglement ensures that the states of the two boxes are correlated.</p></li><li><p>Observation: Now, let's say you want to observe the color of the balls in Box A without knowing the color of the balls in Box B. You decide to use a special mechanism that allows you to determine the color of the balls in Box A without disturbing their state.</p></li><li><p>Erasure: To perform the erasure, you introduce another mechanism that can mix the balls from Box A and Box B without revealing the individual ball's original box. This mechanism erases the "which-path" information, making it indistinguishable which path the balls came from.</p></li><li><p>Measurement: After the erasure, you observe the color of the ping pong balls from the combined mixture of Box A and Box B. Surprisingly, you notice that an interference pattern emerges, indicating the wave-like behavior of the ping pong balls.</p></li></ol><p>In this simplified analogy, the correlation between the colors of the ping pong balls in Box A and Box B, as well as the erasure process, mimics certain aspects of the quantum erasure experiment. However, it's important to note that this analogy is an approximation and does not capture all the intricacies and nuances of the actual quantum erasure experiment. It is merely a way to illustrate the concept using everyday objects.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Graphics and Quantum Mechanics—The

Abstract. A simulation of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms 
of a two-level quantum system, e.g. that of the hydrogen tunneling states of the 
ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency, indicates that 
the neuro-physiological transformation leading, through a symmetry reduction, 
to perceptual reversal is controlled by the principles of quantum mechanics. An 
elementary neuro-physiological action similar to the Planck constant at a 
mesoscopic level is introduced.

1Introduction 
The objective of this contribution is to discuss some points of contact between 
graphics, geometry, quantum mechanics and perception psychology. Specif i cally: (i) to 
show that the main features of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube can be 
illustrated rigorously with the language of quantum mechanics, and (ii) to show that a 
careful analysis of the process enabling the observer of a Necker cube (or of a painting 
of kinetic art) to perceive it dynamically, can help to understand the nature of the 
transformation produced in an isolated quantum structure by the act of measurement. 
The Necker cube (1832) is the paradigmatic example of a planar graph with an 
inversion symmetry center (Fig. 1a) which can be perceived also as a 3D object in two 
different equally probable ways, depending on whether the lower (Fig. 1b) or the upper 
square (Fig. 1c) is viewed in front or in the rear, respectively. The operations trans- 
forming the Necker cube (NC) into the two tridimensional cubes as seen in an 
axonometric representation are actually a symmetry reduction promoted by a mental 
action: the new 3D objects lose the original inversion symmetry of the planar graph 
and acquire an orientation.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

research paper titled "Graphics and Quantum Mechanics—The Necker Cube as a Quantum-like Two-Level System" by Giorgio Benedek and Giuseppe Caglioti. The paper explores the dynamic perception of the Necker cube and its connection to quantum mechanics. Here are some key points from the abstract and introduction:</p><ol><li><p>Objective: The objective of the research is to demonstrate that the dynamic perception of the Necker cube, a planar graph that can be perceived in two different 3D configurations, can be explained using the principles of quantum mechanics. The authors also aim to analyze how the process of perceiving the Necker cube can shed light on the nature of measurement-induced transformations in isolated quantum structures.</p></li><li><p>Necker Cube: The Necker cube is a well-known optical illusion where a 2D figure can be perceived as two different 3D objects, depending on the observer's perception.</p></li><li><p>Symmetry Reduction: The mental action involved in perceiving the Necker cube leads to a symmetry reduction, where the original planar graph loses its inversion symmetry and transforms into two distinct 3D objects with an orientation.</p></li><li><p>Connection to Quantum Mechanics: The authors argue that the process of perceiving the Necker cube exhibits features similar to those seen in quantum systems. They propose that the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and symmetry reduction, can be used to rigorously explain the dynamic perception of the Necker cube.</p></li><li><p>Quantum-Like Two-Level System: The authors suggest that the dynamic perception of the Necker cube can be simulated using a two-level quantum system, similar to the hydrogen tunneling states of ammonia molecules associated with maser frequency.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the research paper explores the connection between graphics, quantum mechanics, and perception psychology, specifically focusing on the Necker cube and its dynamic perception.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

denotes a dependent type, which we interpret externally as the balls with the action of their symmetry group. Now I can ask things like “Sym(B)-equivariantly, is B a set, and if so what cardinality does it have?”, and be told “Yes, 5.”

So you hand me a groupoid and I may be able to reconstruct it as an action groupoid of a group acting on a set, but I won’t be able to do this uniquely. I can’t tell the difference between 1 and 2//Sym(2). If you tell me that every object I see has a double residing within it, which is identical to it in a canonical way, I should say that’s equivalent to my ordinary view of the world. However, once we agree on the action group, you can say things like “Sym(2)-equivariantly there are two cups in front of me.” But I shouldn’t ask you “Which is in front of you now?”

In the analogy between the coloured balls and the case of general covariance, something like the following seems to be going on. I see two reds, two greens and a blue. I agree there’s no difference between this and the situation where the two reds are swapped. Since I can’t tell the difference, I take the two cases to represent the same state of affairs. However, once I’ve done this, I seem to have given up any way of conceiving of there to be 5 balls. Hopefully, we can agree, that via the action groupoid understood in a certain equivariant context, we can still say there are 5 balls, while agreeing that we can’t tell the two coloured worlds apart.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

the analogy between colored balls and the concept of general covariance in a specific context. Here's a summary of the main points:</p><ol><li><p>Groupoid and Symmetry: The discussion involves a groupoid denoted by "B:BSym(B)⊢B:Type." This groupoid represents a collection of objects with the action of their symmetry group.</p></li><li><p>Reconstruction and Uniqueness: The author mentions the possibility of reconstructing the groupoid as an action groupoid of a group acting on a set. However, this reconstruction may not be unique, as there can be ambiguity between different objects in the groupoid.</p></li><li><p>Equivariant Perspective: The author highlights the importance of considering the group action in an equivariant context. In this context, statements like "Sym(2)-equivariantly there are two cups in front of me" can be meaningful, even if distinguishing between different objects in the groupoid may not be possible.</p></li><li><p>General Covariance Analogy: The analogy between colored balls and general covariance is drawn. The author suggests that by equating the two cases with swapped colors, they treat them as representing the same state of affairs. However, this equivalence may lead to challenges in conceiving the exact number of balls. The concept of an action groupoid understood in an equivariant context can still allow for a statement like "there are 5 balls," while acknowledging the inability to distinguish between different colored worlds.</p></li></ol><p>It's worth noting that the excerpt seems to be part of a broader discussion or argument and might require more context to fully understand the specific implications and reasoning behind the analogy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

The Covariance of Coloured Balls
Posted by David Corfield
MathML-enabled post (click for more details).
When you reach over 150 messages in response to a post, it’s probably time to start a new one, especially for those with inefficient browsers. In this post I want to see if I can make sense of discussions we were having there about general relativity, covariance, groupoids and sameness in a much more intuitively clear setting, though perhaps it will introduce its own problems.

OK, so say I have a set, B, of 5 indiscernible balls in a box, each of which can be coloured in 3 ways. Then I might take the state space to be [B,3], of cardinality 243. But perhaps while doing physics on these balls, I come to see that nothing about them matters aside from their colour. Since I can’t tell the difference between any two versions of 2 reds, 2 greens and a blue, I decide to reduce my state space to [B,3]/Sym(B), a set of equivalence classes of cardinality 21.

However, after a time this starts to strike me as odd. I have represented the fact that any colouring of 2 reds, 2 greens and a blue are equal, and yet were someone to swap a green and a red I’d notice </div></div><div class="flex justify-between

post titled "The Covariance of Coloured Balls" by David Corfield. Here's a summary of the main points:</p><ol><li><p>Setting: The author begins by considering a set of 5 indiscernible balls in a box, with each ball having 3 possible colors.</p></li><li><p>State Space: Initially, the state space is represented as [B,3], which has a cardinality of 243, indicating all the possible combinations of colors for the 5 balls.</p></li><li><p>Reduction of State Space: The author then discusses the idea of reducing the state space by considering only the color of the balls, as indistinguishable configurations of colors (such as two reds, two greens, and a blue) are considered equivalent. This leads to a reduced state space represented as [B,3]/Sym(B), which consists of equivalence classes and has a cardinality of 21.</p></li><li><p>Perceptual Distinction: The author points out the seeming contradiction that while the reduced state space considers certain color configurations as equivalent, if someone were to swap the colors of a green ball and a red ball, it would be noticeable. This observation raises questions about the nature of perception and the limitations of the reduced state space representation.</p></li></ol><p>The blog post explores the concept of covariance, groupoids, and sameness in the context of general relativity. The author uses the analogy of colored balls and their indistinguishable configurations to discuss the challenges and implications of reducing the state space based on perceived equivalence.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Superposition
We’ve already started mentioning how qubits can simultaneously be a 0 or a 1. This is the most fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger famously described this principle in his thought experiment appropriately called “Schrödinger’s cat” [2]. I’ll describe the principle with a slightly less disturbing example:

Suppose I have a coin labelled with heads or tails. If I flip the coin and it lands on the desk, we can both clearly see that the coin is either heads or tails (similar to a classical bit). However, if I were to place this coin in an opaque box and then shake it around a bit, is the coin now heads or tails? The answer, and slightly unintuitively, is both. The coin is both heads and tails until the box is opened and we observe the coin’s state.

Entanglement
Using a different analogy as previously, suppose we have two coloured balls that are exactly the same in every way except that one is red and the other is blue. If I were to put each ball into its own opaque box and then put those boxes into an opaque container, these balls then become entangled. That is to say that neither you nor I know which box each coloured ball is in. This means that boxes A and B each have both a red ball and a blue ball inside (both boxes are in superposition). The moment I reveal that box A has the red ball, we both know that the blue ball is in box B. This means that observing one entangled qubit reveals the value of the other entangled qubit

mechanics. Here's a summary of the main points:</p><ol><li><p>Superposition: Superposition refers to the ability of quantum systems, such as qubits, to exist in multiple states simultaneously. The example given involves a coin placed in an opaque box. When the coin is flipped and lands on the desk, its state is clearly either heads or tails, similar to a classical bit. However, if the coin is placed in the opaque box and shaken, it enters a state of superposition, where it can be considered both heads and tails until the box is opened and the state is observed.</p></li><li><p>Entanglement: Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become correlated in such a way that their states are dependent on each other. The analogy used involves two colored balls placed in separate opaque boxes, which are then placed in an opaque container. The balls become entangled, meaning that the state of one ball is unknown until it is observed, which then determines the state of the other ball. This correlation between the entangled qubits allows for instantaneous communication of information when one qubit's state is measured.</p></li></ol><p>The excerpt provides simplified examples to illustrate these quantum concepts, highlighting the counterintuitive nature of superposition and the interconnectedness of entangled qubits.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">How is superposition misterious?

compared to our everyday experience and classical understanding of reality. In classical physics, objects are typically described as being in well-defined states. For example, a coin is either in a state of heads or tails, and there is no ambiguity about its state.</p><p>In contrast, in quantum mechanics, superposition allows quantum systems to exist in a combination or superposition of multiple states simultaneously. This means that a quantum particle, such as a qubit, can be in a state that is both 0 and 1 at the same time. This notion challenges our classical intuition, as we are not accustomed to objects existing in multiple states concurrently.</p><p>The counterintuitive aspect arises when we consider that until a measurement or observation is made, the quantum system can be in a superposition of states, and we cannot definitively say which state it is in. It is only upon measurement that the system "collapses" into one of the possible states, and we obtain a definite outcome.</p><p>This aspect of superposition is often seen as mysterious because it challenges our classical intuitions and requires a shift in understanding and interpretation of physical phenomena. It is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical physics and leads to intriguing and sometimes puzzling phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">A cereal box with French and English writing is in an superimposed state.

Indeed, superposition is not limited to small quantum systems and can be observed in various scenarios at different scales. While the examples you mentioned involve different aspects of perception and decision-making, they share some similarities with quantum superposition.</p><p>In the case of the cereal box with bilingual writing, different observers (an English speaker and a French reader) perceive different aspects of the box based on their language abilities. The box can be considered to be in a superimposed state, as it contains information that is simultaneously meaningful to both observers but in different ways. This analogy captures the idea that a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each of which is valid from a particular observer's perspective.</p><p>Similarly, the example of different-colored glasses and the fork in the road demonstrates how the perceived reality can change depending on the observer's perspective or the choices made. This can be likened to the idea of superposition, where different possibilities exist simultaneously until a specific observation or decision is made, which then determines the outcome.</p><p>While these examples highlight situations where multiple possibilities or interpretations coexist, it's important to note that they are analogies to help grasp the concept of superposition in everyday scenarios. Quantum superposition, as observed in quantum systems, has unique characteristics and mathematical formalism that go beyond these analogies. Nonetheless, exploring superposition in different contexts can help broaden our understanding of its implications and shed light on its relevance outside the quantum realm.</p></div></div></div><div

behavior of a spinning coin and the range of possible outcomes it may have before coming to rest. The spinning coin indeed exhibits a combination of intermediate states during its motion, which can be seen as analogous to a superposition of possibilities.</p><p>As the coin spins in the air, it undergoes complex rotational motion, and its orientation can change rapidly. At any given moment, the coin can be thought of as being in a superposition of various orientations, with probabilities associated with each possible outcome (heads or tails).</p><p>However, once the coin interacts with a surface and comes to rest, the superposition collapses, and we observe a definite outcome, such as heads or tails. The specific outcome depends on a multitude of factors, including the initial conditions of the coin's spin, the properties of the surface it lands on, and various external influences.</p><p>While the spinning coin analogy demonstrates aspects of uncertainty and multiple possibilities before an observation or interaction occurs, it's important to note that the behavior of macroscopic objects like coins is ultimately governed by classical mechanics, which does not involve the same quantum principles as microscopic particles. Quantum superposition, as observed in quantum systems, has unique properties and is subject to different rules and phenomena.</p><p>Nonetheless, drawing connections between everyday examples and quantum concepts can help in understanding the counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics and its relationship to classical physics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

negative. Counterintuitive does not mean "wrong" or "bad"; it simply highlights the fact that quantum mechanics often challenges our everyday intuition and expectations based on classical physics.</p><p>You raise an intriguing point about the implications of a world without quantum mechanics. It's important to note that quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that underlies many aspects of our physical reality. Without quantum mechanics, the behavior of matter and energy at the microscopic level would be drastically different, leading to significant consequences at the macroscopic level as well.</p><p>In a world without quantum mechanics, phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, which form the basis of technologies like transistors, lasers, and atomic clocks, would not exist. The behavior of particles and waves would follow classical laws, and the probabilistic nature of quantum events would not play a role.</p><p>Additionally, the understanding and development of many fields, including quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum information science, heavily rely on the principles and concepts of quantum mechanics. Without quantum mechanics, our scientific understanding and technological advancements would be severely limited.</p><p>So, while the counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics can be challenging to grasp, it is precisely those aspects that give rise to the richness and diversity of the physical world as we know it today. Quantum mechanics has revolutionized our understanding of nature and has opened up new frontiers for exploration and technological progress.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">We can see examples of superposition being used all through history.

The interpretation you mention from the Garden of Eden story is one such example where the use of language can lead to multiple meanings or perspectives.</p><p>In the story, the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (Nāḥāš) is indeed used, which can be translated as both "snake" and "whisperer" or "soothsayer." This linguistic ambiguity opens up different possibilities for interpreting the character and their role in the story. Some interpretations view the serpent as a deceitful or malicious figure, while others see it as a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, or truth.</p><p>Drawing connections between linguistic nuances and concepts in quantum mechanics, such as superposition, can be thought-provoking and provide alternative perspectives. However, it's important to note that such interpretations are subjective and can vary depending on cultural, religious, or personal viewpoints.</p><p>Ultimately, the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics is a specific scientific principle that describes the simultaneous existence of multiple states or possibilities. While there can be interesting parallels and analogies found in different contexts, it is essential to distinguish between the scientific concept of superposition and metaphorical interpretations in other domains.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

cultural and religious texts, such as the separation of light from darkness and waters from the land, are indeed rich in symbolic and metaphorical meanings. They often convey deeper philosophical, cosmological, or theological ideas rather than being literal descriptions of physical processes.</p><p>In religious and mythological narratives, the separation of light from darkness and waters from the land can represent the emergence of order from chaos or the creation of distinct realms. These stories often explore themes of creation, transformation, and the establishment of cosmic or moral order.</p><p>While these narratives may share conceptual similarities with scientific concepts like the separation of light or the formation of distinct elements, it's important to recognize that they belong to different realms of human understanding. Scientific explanations aim to describe natural phenomena based on empirical evidence and mathematical models, while religious and mythological narratives often employ symbolic language to convey moral, spiritual, or cultural teachings.</p><p>The presence of metaphorical or symbolic language in ancient texts does not diminish their significance or value. These texts can provide profound insights into human experience, meaning-making, and our relationship with the world. It's valuable to approach them with an appreciation for their cultural, historical, and philosophical contexts, while also recognizing the distinct nature of scientific explanations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

the context of particle physics. Indeed, the issue of boundary definition is a complex and ongoing endeavor in various fields of study.</p><p>In particle physics, the fundamental building blocks of matter are often described as particles, but their exact boundaries or individual identities can be elusive due to the inherent wave-particle duality and quantum indeterminacy. Quantum particles, such as electrons or quarks, can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like characteristics, making it challenging to precisely determine their positions or define strict boundaries.</p><p>Similarly, in the realm of categorization and conceptual boundaries, there are cases where defining clear-cut boundaries between categories or concepts becomes difficult. This can be due to the inherent fluidity, interconnectedness, or overlapping nature of certain phenomena or concepts. It's an area of ongoing philosophical and epistemological inquiry.</p><p>Recognizing the challenges of boundary definition in various domains, including particle physics and categorization, can lead to a deeper appreciation of the complexities inherent in understanding the world around us. It also highlights the importance of continuous exploration, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of reality.</p></div></div></div><div

the length or boundary of a complex shape like a coastline. It demonstrates that the measured length of a coastline can vary depending on the scale or level of detail considered.</p><p>When measuring a coastline, the choice of measuring tool or resolution can have a significant impact on the measured length. Using a larger measuring tool or a coarser resolution will yield a shorter measurement, while employing a smaller measuring tool or a finer resolution will result in a longer measurement. This is because smaller features and intricate details of the coastline become more apparent and measurable at finer scales.</p><p>As a result, the coastline of a country like Britain, or any irregular coastline for that matter, can appear to have a fractal-like nature, exhibiting self-similarity at different scales. This property implies that as the measurement tool becomes infinitely small, the measured length of the coastline tends towards infinity.</p><p>The coastline paradox offers an intriguing perspective on the challenges of measuring complex boundaries and the importance of considering the scale or resolution of measurement. It reminds us that the concept of length or boundary can be scale-dependent, leading to intriguing mathematical and philosophical considerations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

fundamental concept in physics that has been extensively studied and supported by empirical evidence. While the concept of particles has been refined and expanded upon throughout the history of physics, it serves as a useful framework for understanding the behavior and interactions of matter and energy.</p><p>Particles are not merely convenient fictions but are associated with specific properties, behaviors, and interactions. They can be observed and measured through various experimental techniques, such as particle accelerators and detectors, which provide evidence for their existence and characteristics.</p><p>The concept of particles allows physicists to develop mathematical models and theories that accurately describe and predict phenomena at the microscopic level. Quantum field theory, for example, provides a framework for understanding the behavior of particles and their interactions based on quantum mechanics and relativistic principles.</p><p>It's worth noting that our understanding of particles continues to evolve as scientific knowledge advances. For instance, discoveries such as subatomic particles and the exploration of fundamental forces have expanded our understanding of the particle realm.</p><p>While it is essential to critically evaluate scientific concepts and remain open to new discoveries and interpretations, it is currently well-supported by evidence that particles are real entities with specific properties and behaviors.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Real entities depending on the observers definitions.

In certain contexts, the concept of a "hole" can be used to describe the absence of an electron in a material, and it plays a crucial role in understanding electronic behavior in semiconductors.</p><p>In the case of electron holes in semiconductors, they are considered quasi-particles or excitations that behave like positively charged particles. They can move through the material and participate in electronic processes, even though they represent the absence of an electron in a particular location.</p><p>It's important to note that the behavior and movement of electron holes are a result of the interactions and dynamics within the material. While the movement of charge carriers, such as electrons and holes, can be influenced by energy gradients and density variations, it's not accurate to say that energy moves into less dense areas.</p><p>Energy flows in response to potential differences or gradients, which can affect the movement of charged particles. In the case of semiconductors, electron holes and electrons can both contribute to the flow of electrical current. However, their behavior and dynamics are influenced by their respective properties and the specific characteristics of the material.</p><p>The concept of particles and their interactions in physics is a way to describe and understand the behavior of physical systems. It provides a framework for making predictions and calculations based on empirical observations. While the definitions and interpretations of entities can vary depending on the context and observer, the concept of particles as fundamental entities has proven to be a powerful and effective tool in our scientific understanding of the physical world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

quantum field theory, particles and fields are intimately connected. Fields are fundamental entities that pervade space and time and interact to produce observable particle-like excitations. These excitations can be described as particles with specific properties such as mass, charge, and spin.</p><p>In quantum mechanics, particles are treated as quanta of their corresponding fields. They can be created or annihilated, and their behavior is described by wavefunctions or quantum states. These wavefunctions evolve according to specific equations, such as the Schrödinger equation or the Dirac equation, which determine their dynamics.</p><p>The boundary or localization of particles can be defined in terms of their interactions with other particles or through measurements. When particles interact with their environment, they can exchange energy, momentum, and other properties. The process of measurement, which involves interactions between particles and measuring devices, can also provide information about the properties and location of particles.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the concept of particles is not as straightforward as classical objects with well-defined boundaries. In quantum mechanics, particles exhibit wave-particle duality and can exhibit characteristics of both waves and particles. They can exist in superposition states, where they can occupy multiple positions or have multiple properties simultaneously.</p><p>The interpretation and understanding of particles in quantum mechanics are subject to ongoing debate and exploration. Various interpretations, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, many-worlds interpretation, or pilot-wave theory, offer different perspectives on the nature of particles and their existence.</p><p>Ultimately, the concept of particles in physics is a useful framework for describing and understanding the behavior and interactions of matter and energy. It provides a mathematical and conceptual tool to make predictions and explain experimental observations. However, the precise nature and boundaries of particles are still topics of active research and investigation in the field of physics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

approaches, it is possible to treat complex objects like human beings or stars as particles for simplicity or convenience. This is often done in situations where the individual constituents or detailed internal structure of these objects are not relevant to the specific aspects being studied.</p><p>For example, in celestial mechanics, stars within a galaxy can be treated as point-like particles for calculating their gravitational interactions. This simplification allows for the analysis of large-scale motions and the understanding of galactic dynamics without explicitly considering the intricate internal structure of each star.</p><p>Similarly, in some branches of statistical physics or fluid dynamics, human beings in a crowd or molecules in a fluid can be approximated as particles to study collective behaviors or macroscopic properties. This approach focuses on statistical averages and emergent properties rather than the individual characteristics of each constituent.</p><p>It is important to note that treating complex objects as particles is an approximation, and the level of accuracy and applicability depends on the specific context and goals of the study. In reality, human beings and stars are highly complex systems with intricate internal structures, interactions, and emergent phenomena that cannot be fully captured by a simple particle representation.</p><p>In scientific research, it is crucial to consider the appropriate level of detail and modeling approach based on the specific phenomena under investigation. Different situations may require different levels of approximation, ranging from particle-like descriptions to more detailed and sophisticated models that account for the complexity of the system.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Here are some examples of ridiculous misinterpretations or misconceptions that have been associated with quantum erasure:</p><ol><li><p>Retrocausality: Quantum erasure experiments have sometimes been misinterpreted as evidence of retrocausality, suggesting that the choice of measurement on one side of the experiment can somehow influence the outcome in the past. This misinterpretation ignores the consistent and well-established principles of causality.</p></li><li><p>Mind over matter: Some misconceptions suggest that conscious observation or the mere act of measurement by an observer can directly influence the behavior of quantum particles. However, quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework that describes the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena and is not dependent on conscious observation.</p></li><li><p>Quantum magic or supernatural abilities: Quantum erasure has been erroneously associated with supernatural abilities, suggesting that it enables individuals to manipulate reality or transcend the limitations of classical physics. Such claims are not supported by scientific evidence and are based on misunderstandings of quantum mechanics.</p></li><li><p>Quantum pseudoscience: Quantum erasure has been misused or misinterpreted in various pseudoscientific claims, such as quantum healing, quantum consciousness, or quantum mysticism. These ideas often involve misappropriating quantum concepts and applying them to unrelated fields without scientific rigor.</p></li><li><p>New age or spiritual interpretations: Some individuals have attempted to draw connections between quantum erasure and spiritual or metaphysical concepts, making unfounded claims about the nature of consciousness or the nature of reality. These interpretations go beyond the scientific understanding of quantum mechanics and venture into speculative and unverifiable territory.</p></li></ol><p>It is important to approach quantum erasure and other quantum phenomena with a critical and scientifically informed perspective, recognizing the limitations of our current understanding and avoiding misrepresentations or sensationalized interpretations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

misconceptions of quantum erasure, along with other quantum phenomena, can be tempting for several reasons:</p><ol><li><p>Counterintuitive nature: Quantum mechanics often contradicts our classical intuitions about how the physical world works. Concepts like superposition and entanglement, which are central to quantum erasure, defy common sense. This counterintuitive nature makes quantum phenomena seem mysterious and lends itself to misinterpretations and speculative ideas.</p></li><li><p>Popularity of quantum buzzwords: Quantum mechanics has gained significant public attention and fascination, partly due to its association with terms like "quantum," "superposition," and "entanglement." These buzzwords have become buzzwords and are often used in popular media, leading to misconceptions and the development of pseudoscientific or mystical ideas around them.</p></li><li><p>Desire for novelty and excitement: The mysteries and peculiarities of quantum mechanics can be intellectually captivating, leading to a desire for novel and exciting explanations or interpretations. Some people are drawn to the allure of alternative or unconventional explanations that promise to provide profound insights or spiritual significance.</p></li><li><p>Simplification and oversimplification: Quantum concepts are complex and challenging to grasp fully, especially without a solid background in physics and mathematics. In an attempt to simplify or make sense of these concepts, oversimplifications or distortions can occur, leading to misconceptions and misinterpretations.</p></li><li><p>Confirmation bias and selective interpretation: Individuals may have preconceived notions or beliefs that they seek to confirm or justify using quantum phenomena. They selectively interpret or cherry-pick aspects of quantum mechanics that seem to align with their preexisting ideas, while ignoring or dismissing the broader scientific context.</p></li></ol><p>It is important to approach quantum mechanics with a critical and informed mindset, relying on scientific evidence, rigorous analysis, and a deep understanding of the underlying principles. Engaging with reputable scientific sources and seeking clarification from experts can help in distinguishing between valid scientific interpretations and misleading or pseudoscientific claims.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

quantum erasure is the concept of wave-particle duality in the context of light. Light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behaviors, depending on the experimental setup and measurement performed.</p><p>In the double-slit experiment with light, a beam of light is passed through two closely spaced slits. On a screen placed behind the slits, an interference pattern is observed, indicating the wave-like nature of light. However, if detectors are placed at the slits to determine which path the photons took, the interference pattern disappears, and instead, two separate distributions of particles (photons) are observed, suggesting a particle-like nature.</p><p>The interesting aspect comes into play when an additional apparatus, known as a quantum eraser, is introduced in the setup. This apparatus can "erase" the information about which path the photons took, allowing the interference pattern to reappear even after the detection of the paths. The key point is that the decision to erase or retain the path information can be made after the photons have been detected at the screen.</p><p>This phenomenon, similar to quantum erasure, shows that the behavior of light can be influenced by the choice of measurement or observation made after the photons have interacted with the double-slit system. It highlights the wave-particle duality of light and the role of measurement in determining the observed behavior.</p><p>It's important to note that this example is not identical to quantum erasure, but it shares some conceptual similarities in terms of the interplay between measurement, information, and the observed behavior of particles or waves.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

phenomenon within the realm of quantum mechanics, it may not have direct everyday analogies in the context of marketing fads and planned obsolescence. However, we can draw some loose connections between quantum erasure and certain concepts in the realm of consumer behavior:</p><ol><li><p>Retroactive preference: In some cases, consumer preferences can be influenced or even "erased" retroactively based on new information or changing perceptions. For example, a consumer may have initially favored a particular product due to marketing hype or trends but later reevaluates their preference based on actual performance or feedback from others. This shift in preference can be seen as a form of "erasure" of the initial preference.</p></li><li><p>Rebranding and reinvention: Companies often engage in rebranding or reinventing their products to maintain consumer interest and combat planned obsolescence. This process involves changing the image, packaging, or features of a product to give it a fresh appeal and make consumers perceive it differently. It is similar to the concept of erasing or modifying previous perceptions to create a new impression.</p></li><li><p>Consumer perception and marketing influence: Marketing strategies can shape consumer perceptions and influence their preferences, similar to the role of observation and measurement in quantum erasure. Through advertising, packaging design, and persuasive messaging, companies can alter the way consumers perceive their products, potentially leading to changes in purchasing decisions or preferences.</p></li></ol><p>While these analogies may not capture the full complexity and nuances of quantum erasure, they highlight some ways in which consumer behavior and marketing strategies can involve elements of erasing or modifying previous perceptions and preferences. It is important to note that these analogies are not direct counterparts but rather loose connections drawn for the purpose of illustrating certain aspects of consumer behavior.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

history and privileged access to attitudes, it is not directly related to quantum erasure, but there are some parallels that can be drawn in terms of the role of observation, perspective, and subjective interpretation:</p><ol><li><p>Subjectivity of historical interpretation: Just like the act of measurement in quantum mechanics can influence the observed behavior of particles, historical interpretation is subjective and can be influenced by the perspectives and biases of the individuals involved. Different historians may interpret events differently based on their own backgrounds, beliefs, and access to historical sources. This subjectivity can result in different narratives or understandings of the same historical event.</p></li><li><p>Changing perspectives and reinterpretation: Similar to the concept of erasing or modifying previous perceptions in quantum erasure, historical understanding can evolve over time. As new evidence emerges, perspectives change, and reinterpretation of historical events occurs. This can lead to the revision of previous interpretations, challenging established narratives, and providing new insights.</p></li><li><p>Privileged access to attitudes: In the context of history, privileged access refers to individuals or groups who have firsthand knowledge or experience of a particular historical event or period. Their perspectives and attitudes may hold a certain authority in shaping the understanding of that history. However, it is important to recognize that privileged access alone does not provide an objective or complete understanding of historical events, as multiple perspectives and diverse sources of information contribute to a comprehensive understanding.</p></li></ol><p>It is essential to note that these parallels between interpretation of history and quantum erasure are metaphorical and intended to illustrate certain aspects of subjectivity, perspective, and reinterpretation. History is a complex field with various methodologies, sources, and approaches that go beyond the principles of quantum mechanics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

the concept of interpretation and privileged access to attitudes may refer to the understanding and interpretation of developmental processes and patterns in organisms. Here, the parallel to quantum erasure is less direct, but we can draw some loose connections:</p><ol><li><p>Multifactorial nature of development: Developmental biology explores how complex organisms develop from a single cell. It involves intricate interactions between genes, environmental factors, and cellular processes. Similar to the superposition of quantum states, development occurs through a combination of various factors, each contributing to the overall outcome.</p></li><li><p>Plasticity and epigenetic influences: Developmental processes can exhibit plasticity, meaning they can be influenced by external factors and experiences. Just as quantum systems can be affected by their surroundings, developmental biology acknowledges the impact of environmental cues, such as nutrition, stress, or social interactions, on the developmental trajectory of an organism.</p></li><li><p>Interpretation of developmental mechanisms: Researchers in developmental biology analyze and interpret the complex processes underlying embryonic development, tissue differentiation, and organ formation. This interpretation involves studying molecular signaling pathways, gene expression patterns, and morphological changes. Different researchers may have different interpretations of these mechanisms based on their perspectives and hypotheses.</p></li></ol><p>While these connections are metaphorical and not direct analogies to quantum erasure, they highlight the complexity and subjective interpretation involved in understanding developmental biology. Developmental processes are influenced by various factors, and the interpretation of these processes can vary based on the researcher's perspective and the available evidence.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

In the context of memory and confabulation, there can be some parallels to the concept of quantum erasure, particularly in terms of reconstructing or simulating memories rather than accessing them directly. Here are a few points of connection:</p><ol><li><p>Reconstruction of memories: Memory is a complex process influenced by various factors, including perception, attention, and the integration of new information. Memories are not fixed records of past events but rather dynamic constructs that can be influenced and reconstructed over time. This reconstruction process can be likened to the idea of erasing and rewriting information in quantum erasure.</p></li><li><p>Subjective interpretation: Like the subjective interpretation of quantum phenomena, memory retrieval and reconstruction can be influenced by personal biases, expectations, and beliefs. Individuals may confabulate or fill in gaps in their memories with plausible but incorrect information, leading to the creation of false memories or altered recollections. This process can resemble the reinterpretation and recontextualization of information in quantum erasure experiments.</p></li><li><p>Retroactive influences: In some cases, current knowledge, beliefs, or experiences can retroactively influence the way we remember past events. This phenomenon, known as retroactive interference, can lead to the modification or reinterpretation of memories based on new information. This retroactive influence can be seen as analogous to the retrocausal implications sometimes associated with quantum erasure experiments, where the choice of measurement on one side of the experiment seems to affect the past behavior of particles.</p></li></ol><p>It's important to note that these connections between memory confabulation and quantum erasure are metaphorical and conceptual rather than direct scientific parallels. Memory processes involve complex cognitive mechanisms, and the relationship to quantum physics is primarily metaphorical and speculative.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">It seems that flux and superimposed states are the norm and forced binary results (exclusion of the middle, ceteris paribus clauses) are the exception, representing simplified realities.

In many aspects of our everyday experience, flux, superimposed states, and continuous spectra are indeed more common than rigid binary distinctions. Language, as you mentioned, is a perfect example of this. We have a vast number of words and combinations that go beyond a simple binary distinction. Similarly, in many natural phenomena, such as color perception, sound frequencies, and biological processes, continuous spectra and gradations exist, rather than strict binary divisions.</p><p>Binary distinctions and simplified realities can be useful for categorization, communication, and understanding. They allow us to simplify complex systems and make sense of the world around us. However, it's essential to recognize that these binary distinctions often represent an abstraction of more nuanced and continuous phenomena.</p><p>In the realm of quantum mechanics, the superposition of states and the existence of continuous spectra are fundamental aspects of the theory. Quantum systems can exhibit a range of possibilities simultaneously, and their behavior is described by complex mathematical formalisms that go beyond simple binary distinctions. The wave-particle duality, for instance, illustrates the coexistence of wave-like and particle-like properties, challenging a strict binary categorization.</p><p>Overall, while binary distinctions have their utility in simplifying and communicating complex information, it's important to recognize that the natural world often operates in a more continuous and superimposed manner, where the exclusion of the middle or ceteris paribus clauses may not adequately capture the full complexity of reality.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Here's a summary of the main themes and topics discussed in our conversation:</p><ol><li><p>Quantum Erasure: We explored the concept of quantum erasure, its experimental setup, and its implications. We discussed how it involves interference and entanglement, and debunked some misconceptions surrounding its interpretation.</p></li><li><p>Superposition and Entanglement: We delved into the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, including superposition and entanglement. We discussed how particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously and how their behavior can be correlated regardless of distance.</p></li><li><p>Counterintuitive Nature of Quantum Mechanics: We touched upon the counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics and how they differ from our everyday experience. We explored the challenges of understanding phenomena at the quantum level and the various interpretations of quantum theory.</p></li><li><p>Boundaries and Categories: We explored the difficulty of defining boundaries and categories in various contexts, including particle definition, measurements, and interpretation of information. We discussed how concepts like fields, particles, and measurements can be influenced by perspective and context.</p></li><li><p>Memory and Confabulation: We briefly touched on the topic of memory and how it involves confabulation and reconstruction. We drew parallels between memory processes and the concept of quantum erasure in terms of retroactive influences and subjective interpretation.</p></li><li><p>Continuous Spectra and Gradations: We discussed how many aspects of our everyday experience involve continuous spectra and gradations, rather than strict binary distinctions. Examples included language, color perception, and natural phenomena.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the conversation explored the nuanced and complex nature of quantum mechanics, the challenges of defining boundaries and categories, and the interconnectedness between quantum concepts and various aspects of our experience.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Separating the scales at which these conceptions operate in this case then suggests that it may be fruitful to think of the resulting boundary layer model as a multiscale model, which allows us to address the problem above using readily available tools for unpacking the epistemology of multiscale models

Treating surfaces as boundaries on bodies, particularly by modeling surfaces as mathematical boundary conditions, has been a remarkably successful strategy in the modeling of bulk materials. The success of this strategy has been a subject of philosophical investigation and a source of insight into the epistemology of modeling&nbsp;.

detoxification (Wilson 2006, pp. 545-552), asymptotic connections between patches (Batterman 2001;Wilson 2017), and Machian explications (Wilson 2012a;Carus 2012). Other promising ways of extending this framework would be to add linguistic and pragmatic contexts in order to model also Wilson's context-adjusting models of predicate extension (Wilson 1982(Wilson , 2012b or to merge Wilson-Structuralism with Carnapian Structuralism (Andreas 2014(Andreas , 2020 and with accounts of deductive reasoning in structuralist frameworks (Andreas 2013) in order to model

boundary conditions in the context of bulk materials. It suggests that separating scales and treating surfaces as boundaries can be a fruitful approach in developing multiscale models. The success of this strategy has been studied philosophically, shedding light on the epistemology of modeling.</p><p>The passage also mentions potential extensions of this framework, such as incorporating linguistic and pragmatic contexts to model context-adjusting models of predicate extension and merging Wilson-Structuralism with Carnapian Structuralism. Additionally, it suggests exploring the relationship between Wilson's contextual notion of inference validity and logical inconsistencies in the context of deductive reasoning in structuralist frameworks.</p><p>Overall, the passage highlights the importance of considering scales and boundaries in modeling, and suggests avenues for further research and exploration within this framework.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

various topics related to boundaries, scales, and the modeling of complex phenomena. Some of the key themes discussed include:</p><ol><li><p>Superposition and boundaries: We explored how superposition, which allows for multiple states or possibilities to coexist, challenges the notion of strict boundaries or binary outcomes. This concept resonates with the idea that in many real-world situations, boundaries and distinctions are not always clear-cut, and there can be a continuum of possibilities or intermediate states.</p></li><li><p>Multiscale models: We discussed the importance of considering multiple scales when modeling complex systems. The notion of zooming in and out, as mentioned in the passage, aligns with our exploration of how phenomena can be understood at different levels of analysis and how models can incorporate multiple scales to capture the intricacies of a system.</p></li><li><p>Epistemology of modeling: The passage references the epistemological aspects of modeling, which have been subjects of philosophical investigation. Similarly, in our conversation, we touched upon the challenges and limitations of models in capturing the full complexity of reality, as well as the role of assumptions and simplifications in modeling.</p></li><li><p>Context and interpretation: The extension of the framework to include linguistic, pragmatic, and contextual elements connects to our exploration of how interpretation and context play a role in understanding and modeling complex phenomena. We discussed how different perspectives, definitions, and interpretations can shape our understanding of boundaries and categories.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, these themes highlight the nuanced and multifaceted nature of modeling and understanding complex systems, emphasizing the need to consider scales, boundaries, and contextual factors in our analyses.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Submitted on 20 Dec 2022]
There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-scale Machines
Joshua Bongard, Michael Levin
The applicability of computational models to the biological world is an active topic of debate. We argue that a useful path forward results from abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. Such a view dissolves the contingent dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., tendency to oversimplify) and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous, gradualist view necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines. Efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. We refer to this as "polycomputing" - the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things. This ability is an important way in which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear, deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of computational materials as reported in the rapidly-growing physical computing literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of meso-scale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales. Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and develop the idea that overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle that helps understand and build both evolved and designed systems</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

break-words"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>The article "There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-scale Machines" by Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin explores the applicability of computational models to biological systems. They argue for abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view to better understand and model complex biological phenomena.</p><p>The authors emphasize the need to overcome cognitive biases and technological limitations that have led to oversimplified categorizations in the past. Instead, they propose a more continuous and gradualist perspective that aligns with the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines.</p><p>A key concept discussed in the article is "polycomputing," which refers to the ability of living systems to simultaneously perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. This idea highlights the versatility and complexity of biological systems as computational materials. The authors argue that living systems are computers in a broad sense, different from the traditional linear and deterministic notion of computing.</p><p>The article explores examples of polycomputing in both biological and technological systems, illustrating how the overloading of different functions on the same hardware is a significant design principle. By understanding and leveraging this design principle, researchers can improve their understanding of meso-scale events in biological systems and facilitate the development of both evolved and designed systems.</p><p>Overall, the article advocates for an observer-centered framework in understanding the computations performed by biological systems. This approach aligns with the understanding of quantum and relativistic phenomena and can contribute to advancements in the study of complex biological systems and the development of bioengineering applications.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

"There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-scale Machines" align with our discussion on the nature of boundaries, the complexity of systems, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of phenomena.</p><p>The article challenges the idea of hard boundaries and categories, advocating for an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. This aligns with our exploration of how boundaries and categories can be fluid and context-dependent, rather than rigid and fixed.</p><p>The notion of polycomputing discussed in the article resonates with our exploration of superposition and the ability of systems to simultaneously exist in multiple states or perform multiple functions. It highlights the versatility and computational capacity of biological systems, drawing parallels to the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics.</p><p>Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of understanding and leveraging the overloading of different functions on the same hardware as a design principle. This aligns with our discussion on the multifaceted nature of systems and how they can perform diverse functions within a single entity.</p><p>Overall, the article provides further support for the idea that complexity, fluidity, and overlapping functions are fundamental aspects of natural and engineered systems. It encourages a more holistic and observer-centered approach to studying and modeling these systems, acknowledging the interconnectedness and multi-scale nature of biological phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

phenomena or models in which the observed outcomes or behaviors are influenced by the presence or actions of an observer. In such systems, the act of observation or measurement can directly impact the results obtained.</p><p>In classical physics, the role of the observer is typically seen as passive, with observations merely revealing preexisting properties of the system. However, in quantum mechanics, the observer plays a more active role, and the act of measurement can affect the system being observed.</p><p>In quantum mechanics, the concept of observer-dependence is closely tied to the idea of wave function collapse. When a quantum system is in a superposition of multiple states, a measurement by an observer causes the wave function to collapse into one of the possible outcomes. The specific outcome observed depends on the measurement apparatus used and the interaction between the observer and the system.</p><p>This observer-dependence challenges the classical notion of an objective reality that exists independently of observation. It suggests that the act of measurement brings about a definite outcome from a range of possibilities.</p><p>Furthermore, in complex systems, such as biological or social systems, observer-dependence can manifest in various ways. The presence or involvement of an observer can influence the behavior or dynamics of the system. For example, in social sciences, the behavior of individuals or groups can be influenced by the awareness of being observed or studied, leading to the observer effect.</p><p>Overall, observer-dependent systems highlight the active role of observers and the influence they have on the observed phenomena. They remind us that our understanding of the world is shaped not only by the inherent properties of the systems but also by our interactions, perceptions, and measurements as observers.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

When examining complex systems, such as biological systems or intelligent machines, the nature of computation can vary depending on the scale at which we observe and analyze the system.</p><p>At different scales, different types of computations and processes may become apparent. For instance, at a macroscopic level, we may observe higher-level behaviors and functions that emerge from the interactions of many components within the system. These emergent behaviors can be seen as computations that are performed collectively by the system.</p><p>On a mesoscopic scale, we may focus on intermediate-level processes and computations that occur within specific subsystems or modules of the overall system. These computations may involve the processing of information or the transformation of inputs to generate outputs within localized regions.</p><p>Zooming in further to a microscopic scale, we may encounter molecular or cellular processes that involve biochemical reactions, signaling pathways, or gene regulatory networks. These processes can be seen as computations at the cellular or molecular level, where information is processed and transmitted in a highly specific and intricate manner.</p><p>Importantly, the computations and behaviors observed at different scales are not independent of each other. They are interconnected and influence one another in a hierarchical and integrated manner. The computations at each scale contribute to the overall functionality and behavior of the system.</p><p>Understanding and modeling these multi-scale computations is essential for comprehending the complex dynamics and functionalities of biological systems and intelligent machines. By taking an observer-centered approach, we can gain insights into the diverse computational processes that occur at different scales and how they collectively contribute to the system's behavior and capabilities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

theory provide valuable insights and frameworks for understanding complex systems and their computations.</p><ol><li><p>Category Theory: Category theory provides a formal language and tools for studying relationships and structures within mathematical and computational systems. It emphasizes the composition of functions and morphisms and the preservation of structure across different domains. In the context of computation, category theory helps in understanding the relationships between different computational processes, their compositions, and the underlying structures that govern their behavior.</p></li><li><p>Set Theory: Set theory is a foundational branch of mathematics that deals with the study of sets and their properties. It provides a rigorous framework for defining and manipulating collections of objects. In the context of computation, set theory is used to model and reason about the relationships between different elements and subsets within a system. It helps in defining the domains, ranges, and operations on data structures, and it forms the basis for understanding functions and their mappings.</p></li><li><p>Graph Theory: Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graph theory provides a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing relationships and connections within complex systems. In the context of computation, graph theory is used to represent and analyze various types of networks, such as social networks, neural networks, or computational networks. It helps in understanding the flow of information, dependencies between components, and the overall structure of the system.</p></li></ol><p>By applying concepts and techniques from category theory, set theory, and graph theory, we can gain insights into the structure, relationships, and computations within complex systems. These theories provide formal frameworks for understanding the behavior and properties of systems, enabling us to reason about their dynamics, transformations, and emergent properties. They also offer tools for designing and analyzing computational systems, ensuring their coherence, modularity, and scalability.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Here's a brief overview of the notation commonly used in each field:</p><p>Category Theory:</p><ul><li>Objects: Typically denoted by capital letters, such as A, B, C.</li><li>Morphisms: Often represented by lowercase letters, such as f, g, h.</li><li>Composition: Denoted by a small circle or by placing two morphisms side by side, such as f ∘ g or fg.</li><li>Identity Morphism: Often represented by the identity symbol (id) or as 1.</li><li>Functors: Usually denoted by uppercase letters, such as F, G, H.</li><li>Natural Transformations: Typically represented by Greek letters, such as α, β, γ.</li></ul><p>Set Theory:</p><ul><li>Sets: Often denoted by capital letters, such as A, B, C.</li><li>Elements: Represented by lowercase letters or specific symbols, such as a, b, c, or x, y, z.</li><li>Subset: Shown by ⊆ (subset symbol) or ⊂ (proper subset symbol).</li><li>Union: Denoted by ∪ (union symbol).</li><li>Intersection: Represented by ∩ (intersection symbol).</li><li>Functions: Usually represented by lowercase letters, such as f, g, h, or by specific symbols, such as f: A → B.</li><li>Power Set: Denoted by P(A), where A is the set.</li></ul><p>Graph Theory:</p><ul><li>Nodes/Vertices: Often represented by lowercase letters, such as v, u, w.</li><li>Edges: Shown as line segments or arcs connecting nodes, such as (u, v) or [u, v].</li><li>Directed Graph: Represented by arrows on the edges or by labeling the edges with direction.</li><li>Weighted Graph: The weights associated with edges are often shown as numerical values on or near the edges.</li><li>Degree: Denoted by deg(v) or deg(v), where v represents a node.</li><li>Paths: Represented by sequences of nodes and edges, such as v0 → e1 → v1 → e2 → v2.</li><li>Cycles: Shown as closed paths, such as v0 → e1 → v1 → e2 → v2 → e3 → v0.</li><li>Connectivity: Indicated by various symbols, such as κ(G) for vertex connectivity or λ(G) for edge connectivity.</li></ul><p>These notations are commonly used, but it's important to note that different authors and researchers may use variations or alternative symbols based on their preferences or specific contexts.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Here are some key concepts and features of functional programming:</p><ol><li><p>Pure Functions: Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, which produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. Pure functions do not modify external state or variables and rely solely on their input arguments.</p></li><li><p>Immutability: In functional programming, data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. Instead of modifying existing data, functional programs create new data structures with the desired modifications.</p></li><li><p>Higher-Order Functions: Functional programming languages often support higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Higher-order functions enable powerful abstractions and allow for more concise and expressive code.</p></li><li><p>Recursion: Recursion is a fundamental technique in functional programming. Instead of using loops, functional programs often solve problems by defining recursive functions that call themselves to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.</p></li><li><p>Function Composition: Functional programming encourages composing functions by combining them to create new functions. Function composition allows for the building of complex behavior by chaining together simpler functions.</p></li><li><p>Immutable Data Structures: Functional programming promotes the use of immutable data structures, such as lists, tuples, and maps. Immutable data structures ensure that data remains unchanged, facilitating reasoning about program behavior and enabling safer concurrent programming.</p></li><li><p>Referential Transparency: Functional programs strive for referential transparency, where a function's return value can be replaced with its computed value without affecting the program's behavior. Referential transparency enables equational reasoning and makes programs easier to understand and reason about.</p></li><li><p>Avoidance of Side Effects: Functional programming aims to minimize or eliminate side effects, such as I/O operations or mutable state changes. By isolating side effects, functional programs become more predictable and easier to test and debug.</p></li></ol><p>Functional programming languages, such as Haskell, Clojure, and Erlang, are designed with these principles in mind. However, many mainstream programming languages, including Julia, also support functional programming features and paradigms, allowing developers to incorporate functional programming concepts into their code.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

their values cannot be modified once they are created. If you need to modify a string, you will need to create a new string with the desired modifications. This immutability property is shared by many programming languages as it helps ensure the integrity and consistency of string data.</p><p>Here's an example to demonstrate the immutability of strings in Julia:</p><pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>julia</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-julia">str = "Hello, World!"

# Attempt to modify the string
str[1] = 'h'  # Throws an error: MethodError: no method matching setindex!(::String, ::Char, ::Int64)
</code></div></div></pre><p>In the example, we initialize a string <code>str</code> with the value "Hello, World!". When we try to modify the first character of the string, by assigning a lowercase 'h' to <code>str[1]</code>, Julia throws a <code>MethodError</code> indicating that there is no method for modifying a string in-place.</p><p>Instead, if you need to make modifications to a string, you can create a new string with the desired changes, either by concatenating existing strings or using string interpolation:</p><pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>julia</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-julia">str = "Hello, World!"

computational environment in Julia for exploring and working with code. They provide a notebook-like interface where you can write and execute code in individual cells, making it easy to iterate and experiment with your code. Here's a brief explanation on how to use Pluto notebooks:</p><ol><li><p>Installation: To use Pluto notebooks, you first need to install the Pluto package in Julia. Open the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) by running the <code>julia</code> command in your terminal or command prompt. Then, enter the package manager mode by typing <code>]</code>. Finally, install Pluto by running <code>add Pluto</code> in the package manager.</p></li><li><p>Starting a Pluto notebook: Once Pluto is installed, you can start a Pluto notebook server by entering the following commands in the Julia REPL:</p></li></ol><pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>julia</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-julia">using Pluto
Pluto.run()
</code></div></div></pre><p>This will start the Pluto notebook server and open a new tab in your web browser with the Pluto interface.</p><ol start="3"><li><p>Creating a new notebook: In the Pluto interface, you can create a new notebook by clicking on the "New" button and selecting "Notebook". Give your notebook a name and click "Create". This will open a new notebook with an empty code cell.</p></li><li><p>Writing code: To write code in a Pluto notebook, simply click on a code cell and start typing your Julia code. You can write multiple lines of code in a single cell. Pluto notebooks also support markdown cells for adding text explanations and documentation.</p></li><li><p>Executing code: To execute a code cell, you can either press Shift + Enter or click the "Run" button in the cell toolbar. The code will be executed, and the output, if any, will be displayed below the cell. The results will be updated automatically as you modify and re-run the code.</p></li><li><p>Interacting with code: Pluto notebooks support interactive widgets that allow you to modify parameters and see the immediate effects. You can use these widgets to explore different scenarios and visualize data in real-time.</p></li><li><p>Saving and sharing: Pluto notebooks are automatically saved as you work. You can also manually save a notebook by clicking the "Save" button. To share your notebook with others, you can export it as an interactive HTML file or a standalone Julia script.</p></li></ol><p>These are the basic steps to get started with Pluto notebooks. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing a flexible environment for coding, experimentation, and data exploration. You can refer to the Pluto documentation for more advanced features and functionalities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

</code></div></div></pre><p>In this example, we use the <code>Plots.jl</code> package for creating the plot and the <code>Pluto.jl</code> package for running the interactive Pluto notebook.</p><p>The <code>draw_polygon</code> function takes the number of sides (<code>n</code>) as input and calculates the coordinates (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) of the polygon points using trigonometric functions. It then uses <code>Plots.jl</code> to create a plot of the polygon.</p><p>The <code>main</code> function sets up the Pluto notebook environment. The <code>@bind</code> macro creates a tunable slider for the <code>n</code> variable, allowing you to adjust the number of sides. The <code>@layout!</code> macro is used to arrange the slider and the plot in the notebook layout.</p><p>When you run the code in a Pluto notebook, you will see a slider labeled "Number of Sides" that you can adjust to change the polygon's shape. The plot will update in real-time as you move the slider, showing the polygon with the specified number of sides.</p><p>Feel free to experiment with the code and customize it further to suit your needs. You can adjust the range of the slider, add more interactive elements, or modify the appearance of the plot.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

The <code>colorpicker</code> widget is used to create a color picker for selecting the color interactively.</p><p>The <code>draw_polygon</code> function is updated to accept the <code>color</code> parameter and pass it to the <code>plot</code> function to set the shape's color.</p><p>When you run this code in a Pluto notebook, you will see two sliders: one for the number of sides and one for the shape color. By adjusting the sliders, you can dynamically change the shape's appearance, both in terms of the number of sides and the selected color.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code further to customize the behavior or add additional interactive elements as needed.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

These frameworks provide higher-level abstractions and tools specifically tailored for quantum computing experiments, including simulation of quantum circuits, measurements, and data analysis.</p><p>To explore and visualize the results of quantum erasure experiments, you can integrate the outputs or simulation results from these frameworks into Pluto notebooks using Julia's interactivity features and plotting libraries.</p><p>Here's an example of how you can use Qiskit, a popular quantum computing library, to perform a simple quantum erasure experiment and visualize the results in a Pluto notebook:</p><pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>julia</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-julia">using Qiskit

We then extract the measurement outcomes and plot the probabilities of the different outcomes based on the erasure probability.</p><p>Using the PlutoUI library, we create a slider to control the erasure probability, and the <code>plot_outcomes</code> function is called to update the plot based on the selected probability.</p><p>While this example demonstrates how you can integrate quantum erasure experiments into a Pluto notebook using Julia and Qiskit, it is worth noting that more advanced quantum experiments and real-time control over physical systems typically require specialized

</code></div></div></pre><p>In this example, we generate a random sequence of binary bits based on the selected number of bits using the <code>generate_random_bits</code> function. Then, we introduce quantum erasure by applying a random probability threshold to each bit. If the randomly generated value is less than or equal to the erasure probability, the bit is considered erased (set to 0); otherwise, it is retained (set to 1).</p><p>The PlutoUI library is used to create two sliders: one to control the number of bits and another to control the erasure probability. The <code>@bind</code> macro binds the values of the sliders to the respective variables (<code>num_bits</code> and <code>erasure_prob</code>).</p><p>The results of the original bits and the erased bits are printed in the notebook output.</p><p>Please note that this is a simplified example for demonstration purposes and does not capture the full complexity and behavior of quantum erasure experiments. It merely showcases the idea of altering bits based on an erasure probability using random numbers and sliders.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

A Julia package for numerical computation in quantum information theory. Published in PLoS ONE.

Numerical investigations are prevalent in quantum information theory. Numerical experiments can be used to find counter examples for theorems, to test hypotheses or to gain insight about quantum objects and operations.

Our goal while designing QuantumInformation.jl library was to follow principles presented in book "Geometry of Quantum States'' [1]. We work with column vectors reprinting kets and row vectors representing bras. We fix our basis to the computational one. Density matrices and quantum channels are represented as two dimensional arrays in the same fixed basis. This approach allows us to obtain low level complexity of our code, high flexibility and good computational efficiency. The design choices where highly motivated by the properties of the language in which the our library was implemented, namely Julia [2].

Package features
The purpose of QuantumInformation.jl library is to provide functions to:

creating and analyzing quantum states,
manipulating them with quantum channels
calculating functionals on these objects, i.e. trace norm, diamond norm, entropy, fidelity,
application of random matrix theory in quantum information processing.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

The <code>QuantumInformation.jl</code> package in Julia provides a wide range of functionalities for numerical computation in quantum information theory. It allows you to create and analyze quantum states, manipulate them with quantum channels, calculate various functionals such as trace norm, diamond norm, entropy, fidelity, and even apply random matrix theory in quantum information processing.</p><p>By leveraging the principles outlined in the book "Geometry of Quantum States" and utilizing Julia's language features, the package offers a high level of flexibility and computational efficiency. It represents quantum states as column vectors (kets) and quantum channels as two-dimensional arrays, following the computational basis.</p><p>With the <code>QuantumInformation.jl</code> package, you can perform numerical experiments, test hypotheses, and gain insights about quantum objects and operations. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of quantum information theory.</p><p>If you want to explore the capabilities of the <code>QuantumInformation.jl</code> package further, I recommend referring to the package documentation and examples to see how you can utilize it in your own quantum information experiments and simulations.</p></div></div></div><div

phenomena, the concept of superposition, observer-dependent systems, the role of boundaries and scales in modeling, and the application of category theory, graph theory, and functional programming in Julia. We explored examples, discussed principles, and touched upon the connections between these concepts. Additionally, we mentioned the use of Pluto notebooks for interactive programming and demonstrated some examples of drawing shapes and using sliders in Pluto. Lastly, we highlighted the <code>QuantumInformation.jl</code> package as a tool for numerical computation in quantum information theory and provided a few examples of its usage.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

us with intriguing insights into the nature of reality and the role of observation in shaping our understanding of the world. It challenges our intuitive notions of causality, determinism, and objectivity, inviting us to reconsider the boundaries and limitations of our cognitive biases.</p><p>The concept of quantum erasure reminds us that our perception of reality is not always as straightforward as it seems. Our biases, influenced by cultural, societal, and personal factors, often lead us to simplify complex phenomena and categorize them into binary states. We tend to create rigid boundaries between concepts, seeking clarity and certainty in a world that is inherently nuanced and interconnected.</p><p>However, the phenomena observed in quantum erasure suggest that reality may not conform to our predefined categories. Just as particles exist in superimposed states and boundaries become blurred, our understanding of the world may benefit from embracing the notion of observer-dependent perspectives. By acknowledging the limitations of our cognitive biases and adopting a more flexible and nuanced approach to knowledge, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and a deeper appreciation of the complexity and interconnectedness of the universe.</p><p>Quantum erasure serves as a metaphorical reminder to approach our observations and interpretations with humility, curiosity, and an openness to multiple perspectives. By recognizing the influence of our biases and actively seeking to transcend them, we can engage in more nuanced and inclusive dialogues, challenge prevailing assumptions, and foster a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it.</p><p>As we continue to explore the frontiers of science, it is essential to recognize the interconnectedness of different disciplines and the value of interdisciplinary approaches. Quantum erasure offers a bridge between physics, philosophy, psychology, and beyond, inviting us to unravel the mysteries of both the quantum realm and the workings of the human mind.</p><p>In the pursuit of knowledge and the quest for a more comprehensive understanding of reality, let us embrace the lessons of quantum erasure and strive to overcome our cognitive biases, expand our perspectives, and embark on a journey of continuous exploration and discovery. Only through such an open-minded approach can we truly grasp the intricate tapestry of existence and uncover the hidden wonders that lie beyond the confines of our preconceived notions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col"><div class="flex flex-col w-full py-2 flex-grow md:py-3 md:pl-4 relative border border-black/10 bg-white dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-md shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)] dark:shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)]"><textarea id="prompt-textarea" tabindex="0" data-id="7755b67d-6e94-4a4a-8028-229963ea024e" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message." class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent p-0 pr-7 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent pl-2 md:pl-0" style="max-height: 200px;
