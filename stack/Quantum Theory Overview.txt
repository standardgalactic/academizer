Quantum Theory, Groups and Representations: 
An Introduction 
Revised and expanded version, under

Preface 
This book began as course notes prepared for a class taught at Columbia Uni- 
versity during the 2012-13 academic year. The intent was to cover the basics of 
quantum mechanics, up to and including relativistic quantum i eld theory of free 
i elds, from a point of view emphasizing the role of unitary representations of 
Lie groups in the foundations of the subject. The notes were later signif i cantly 
rewritten and extended, partially based upon experience teaching the same ma- 
terial during 2014-15, and published by Springer in 2017. The current version 
is under revision as I teach the course again during the 2020-21 academic year. 
The approach to this material is simultaneously rather advanced, using cru- 
cially some fundamental mathematical structures discussed, if at all, only in 
graduate mathematics courses, while at the same time trying to do this in as 
elementary terms as possible.The Lie groups needed are (with one crucial 
exception) ones that can be described simply in terms of matrices. Much of 
the representation theory will also just use standard manipulations of matrices. 
The only prerequisite for the course as taught was linear algebra and multi- 
variable calculus (while a full appreciation of the topics covered would benef i t 
from quite a bit more than this). My hope is that this level of presentation will 
simultaneously be useful to mathematics students trying to learn something 
about both quantum mechanics and Lie groups and their representations, as 
well as to physics students who already have seen some quantum mechanics, 
but would like to know more about the mathematics underlying the subject, 
especially that relevant to exploiting symmetry principles. 
The topics covered emphasize the mathematical structure of the subject, and 
often intentionally avoid overlap with the material of standard physics courses 
in quantum mechanics and quantum i eld theory, for which many excellent text- 
books are available. This document is best read in conjunction with such a text. 
In particular, some experience with the details of the physics not covered here 
is needed to truly appreciate the subject. Some of the main dif f erences with 
standard physics presentations include: 
��� The role of Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their unitary representations is 
systematically emphasized, including not just the standard use of these to 
derive consequences for the theory of a ���symmetry��� generated by operators 
commuting with the Hamiltonian. 
��� Symplectic geometry and the role of the Lie algebra of functions on phase space in the classical theory of Hamiltonian mechanics is emphasized. 
���Quantization��� is then the passage to a unitary representation (unique 
by the Stone-von Neumann theorem) of a subalgebra of this Lie algebra. 
��� The role of the metaplectic representation and the subtleties of the pro- 
jective factor involved are described in detail. This includes phenomena 
depending on the choice of a complex structure, a topic known to physi- 
cists as ���Bogoliubov transformations���. 
��� The closely parallel story of the Clif f ord algebra and spinor representa- 
tion is extensively investigated. These are related to the Heisenberg Lie 
algebra and the metaplectic representation by interchanging commutative 
(���bosonic���) and anticommutative (���fermionic���) generators, introducing 
the notion of a ���Lie superalgebra��� generalizing that of a Lie algebra. 
��� Many topics usually i rst encountered in physics texts in the context of 
relativistic quantum i eld theory are instead i rst developed in simpler 
non-relativistic or i nite dimensional contexts. Non-relativistic quantum 
i eld theory based on the Schr�� odinger equation is described in detail before 
moving on to the relativistic case. The topic of irreducible representations 
of space-time symmetry groups is i rst addressed with the case of the 
Euclidean group, where the implications for the non-relativistic theory 
are explained. The analogous problem for the relativistic case, that of the 
irreducible representations of the Poincar�� e group, is then worked out later 
on. 
��� The emphasis is on the Hamiltonian formalism and its representation- 
theoretical implications, with the Lagrangian formalism (the basis of most 
quantum i eld theory textbooks) de-emphasized. In particular, the opera- 
tors generating symmetry transformations are derived using the moment 
map for the action of such transformations on phase space, not by invoking 
Noether���s theorem for transformations that leave invariant a Lagrangian. 
��� Care is taken to keep track of the distinction between vector spaces and 
their duals. It is the dual of phase space (linear coordinates on phase 
space) that appears in the Heisenberg Lie algebra, with quantization a 
representation of this Lie algebra by linear operators. 
��� The distinction between real and complex vector spaces, along with the 
role of complexif i cation and choice of a complex structure, is systemati- 
cally emphasized. A choice of complex structure plays a crucial part in 
quantization using annihilation and creation operator methods, especially 
in relativistic quantum i eld theory, where a dif f erent sort of choice than 
in the non-relativistic case is responsible for the existence of antiparticles. 
Some dif f erences with other mathematics treatments of this material are: 
��� A fully rigorous treatment of the subject is not attempted. At the same 
time an ef f ort is made to indicate where signif i cant issues arise should one pursue such a treatment, and to provide references to rigorous discussions 
of these issues.An attempt is also made to make clear the dif f erence 
between where a rigorous treatment could be pursued relatively straight- 
forwardly, and where there are serious problems of principle making a 
rigorous treatment hard to achieve. 
��� The discussion of Lie groups and their representations is focused on spe- 
cif i c examples, not the general theory. For compact Lie groups, emphasis 
is on the groups U(1),SO(3),SU(2) and their i nite dimensional repre- 
sentations. Central to the basic structure of quantum mechanics are the 
Heisenberg group, the symplectic groups Sp(2n,R) and the metaplectic 
representation, as well as the spinor groups and the spin representation. 
The geometry of space-time leads to the study of Euclidean groups in two 
and three dimensions, and the Lorentz (SO(3,1)) and Poincar�� e groups, 
together with their representations. These examples of non-compact Lie 
groups are a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, but not a con- 
ventional topic in the mathematics curriculum. 
��� A central example studied thoroughly and in some generality is that of the 
metaplectic representation of the double cover of Sp(2n,R) (in the com- 
mutative case), or spin representation of the double cover of SO(2n,R) 
(anticommutative case). This specif i c example of a representation provides 
the foundation of quantum theory, with quantum i eld theory involving a 
generalization to the case of n inf i nite. 
��� No attempt is made to pursue a general notion of quantization, despite 
the great mathematical interest of such generalizations. In particular, at- 
tention is restricted to the case of quantization of linear symplectic man- 
ifolds. The linear structure plays a crucial role, with quantization given 
by a representation of a Heisenberg algebra in the commutative case, a 
Clif f ord algebra in the anticommutative case.The very explicit meth- 
ods used (staying close to the physics formalism) mostly do not apply to 
more general conceptions of quantization (e.g., geometric quantization) of 
mathematical interest for their applications in representation theory. 
The scope of material covered in later sections of the book is governed by 
a desire to give some explanation of what the central mathematical objects are 
that occur in the Standard Model of particle physics, while staying within the 
bounds of a one-year course. The Standard Model embodies our best current 
understanding of the fundamental nature of reality, making a better understand- 
ing of its mathematical nature a central problem for anyone who believes that 
mathematics and physics are intimately connected at their deepest levels. The 
author hopes that the treatment of this subject here will be helpful to anyone 
interested in pursuing a better understanding of this connection.

It sounds like you've shared an excerpt from a book by Peter Woit titled
"Quantum Theory, Groups and Representations: An Introduction"
. This book delves deeply into quantum mechanics and its underlying mathematical principles, particularly emphasizing the role of Lie groups and their representations. Woit's work seems to aim at bridging the gap between mathematical rigor and practical understanding in quantum physics, making it accessible to students with a background primarily in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, while also being beneficial for those seeking a deeper understanding of the mathematical framework behind quantum mechanics and field theories. The book appears to adopt an educational approach by first establishing foundational concepts in non-relativistic settings before advancing to more complex topics such as relativistic field theories and the mathematics of the Standard Model of particle physics. This gradual progression aids in the comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, making it a valuable resource for both mathematicians and physicists.

1.2Basic principles of quantum mechanics 
We���ll divide the conventional list of basic principles of quantum mechanics into 
two parts, with the i rst covering the fundamental mathematics structures. 
1.2.1Fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics 
In classical physics, the state of a system is given by a point in a ���phase space���, 
which can be thought of equivalently as the space of solutions of an equation 
of motion, or as (parametrizing solutions by initial value data) the space of 
coordinates and momenta. Observable quantities are just functions on this space 
(e.g., functions of the coordinates and momenta). There is one distinguished 
observable, the energy or Hamiltonian, and it determines how states evolve in 
time through Hamilton���s equations. 
The basic structure of quantum mechanics is quite dif f erent, with the for- 
malism built on the following simple axioms: 
Axiom (States). The state of a quantum mechanical system is given by a non- 
zero vector in a complex vector space H with Hermitian inner product �����,�����. 
We���ll review in chapter 4 some linear algebra, including the properties of in- 
ner products on complex vector spaces. H may be i nite or inf i nite dimensional, 
with further restrictions required in the inf i nite dimensional case (e.g., we may 
want to require H to be a Hilbert space). Note two very important dif f erences 
with classical mechanical states: 
��� The state space is always linear: a linear combination of states is also a 
state. 
��� The state space is a complex vector space: these linear combinations can 
and do crucially involve complex numbers, in an inescapable way. In the 
classical case only real numbers appear, with complex numbers used only 
as an inessential calculational tool. 
We will sometimes use the notation introduced by Dirac for vectors in the state 
space H: such a vector with a label �� is denoted

In the segment you've shared, the text outlines some of the fundamental principles and axioms of quantum mechanics, contrasting them with classical physics concepts to highlight their unique characteristics.
Key Points from the Segment:
Quantum vs. Classical States
:
In classical physics, the state of a system is defined as a point in phase space, described by coordinates and momenta derived from initial conditions. The evolution of these states is governed by Hamilton's equations, with the energy or Hamiltonian functioning as a primary observable that dictates how states change over time.
In quantum mechanics, states are defined fundamentally differently. A quantum state is represented by a non-zero vector in a complex vector space (denoted
H
H
H
), equipped with a Hermitian inner product. This space may be finite or infinite dimensional, with infinite dimensions often requiring the structure of a Hilbert space to manage more complex mathematical properties.
Linear and Complex Nature of Quantum States
:
Quantum state spaces are inherently linear, meaning that any linear combination of states also constitutes a valid state. This principle underlies the superposition principle in quantum mechanics, where a system can exist simultaneously in multiple states until measured.
The use of complex numbers is essential and intrinsic in quantum mechanics, unlike in classical mechanics where complex numbers might be used merely as computational tools. This fundamental use of complex numbers in quantum mechanics enables the description of phenomena such as interference and quantum coherence.
Notation
:
The text introduces the notation commonly used in quantum mechanics, often referred to as Dirac or bra-ket notation. States are denoted by
���
��
���
|\psi\rangle
���
��
���
, where
��
\psi
��
is a label for the vector in the complex vector space
H
H
H
. This notation is particularly useful for handling the abstract concepts of state vectors, their transformations, and interactions in a compact and mathematically rigorous manner.
Implications and Further Topics:
These foundational differences between classical and quantum mechanics set the stage for further discussions on quantum observables, measurement theory, and operator algebra. Each of these areas builds on the basic structure described, integrating more complex mathematical tools and concepts to explore the behaviors and properties of quantum systems.
The segment you provided does a good job of summarizing these core distinctions and axiomatic foundations in quantum mechanics, setting up for a deeper exploration of the subject in subsequent chapters, particularly focusing on the mathematical underpinnings and implications for physical phenomena observed in quantum systems.

Axiom (Quantum observables). The observables of a quantum mechanical sys- 
tem are given by self-adjoint linear operators on H. 
We���ll review the def i nition of self-adjointness for H i nite dimensional in 
chapter 4. For H inf i nite dimensional, the def i nition becomes much more subtle, 
and we will not enter into the analysis needed. 
Axiom (Dynamics). There is a distinguished quantum observable, the Hamil-

The Hamiltonian observable H will have a physical interpretation in terms of en- 
ergy, with the boundedness condition necessary in order to assure the existence 
of a stable lowest energy state.

(eV is the unit of ���electron-Volt���, the energy acquired by an electron moving 
through a one-Volt electric potential). The most natural units to use for quan- 
tum mechanical problems would be energy and time units chosen so that ��� = 1. 
For instance one could use seconds for time and measure energies in the very 
small units of 6.6 �� 10���16eV, 
or use eV for energies, and then the very small 
units of 6.6��10���16seconds 
for time. Schr�� odinger���s equation implies that if one 
is looking at a system where the typical energy scale is an eV, one���s state-vector 
will be changing on the very short time scale of 6.6 �� 10���16seconds. 
When we 
do computations, usually we will set ��� = 1, implicitly going to a unit system 
natural for quantum mechanics. After calculating a i nal result, appropriate 
factors of ��� can be inserted to get answers in more conventional unit systems. 
It is sometimes convenient however to carry along factors of ���, since this 
can help make clear which terms correspond to classical physics behavior, and 
which ones are purely quantum mechanical in nature. Typically classical physics

life, but it can also always be achieved by taking ��� ��� 0, and this is what will 
often be referred to as the ���classical limit���. One should keep in mind though 
that the manner in which classical behavior emerges out of quantum theory in 
such a limit can be a very complicated phenomenon.

The text provides a deeper look into two core axioms that define the framework of quantum mechanics:
Axiom: Quantum Observables
Self-adjoint Operators
: Quantum observables are described as self-adjoint linear operators on a complex vector space
H
H
H
, where
H
H
H
can be either finite or infinite dimensional. Self-adjointness ensures that the eigenvalues of these operators (which correspond to the measurable values of the observables) are real, a necessary condition for physical observables.
Complexity in Infinite Dimensions
: The definition of self-adjointness is straightforward in finite dimensions but becomes more nuanced in infinite dimensions. The text indicates that a detailed discussion on infinite dimensions is avoided, suggesting that it involves more advanced mathematical analysis.
Axiom: Dynamics
Schrodinger Equation
: The fundamental equation of motion in quantum mechanics is the Schrodinger equation, which describes how the state of a quantum system evolves over time. This equation is linear, reflecting the underlying linearity of the quantum state space.
Hamiltonian as an Observable
: The Hamiltonian
H
H
H
is a special observable representing the total energy of the system. It plays a crucial role in the dynamics of quantum states, where its eigenvalues must be bounded below to ensure the existence of a stable ground state, or lowest energy state.
Planck���s Constant
���
\hbar
���
: This constant is fundamental in quantum mechanics, linking the units of energy and time. It appears in the Schrodinger equation as a scaling factor and has significant physical implications, particularly when considering the scales of quantum phenomena versus classical phenomena.
Practical Implications and Further Insights
Units and Scaling
: The text explains the practical use of
���
\hbar
���
in computations, often setting
���
=
1
\hbar = 1
���
=
1
to simplify calculations within a natural quantum mechanical unit system. Converting back to standard units after calculations is common to relate results to more familiar scales.
Classical Limit
: An interesting aspect discussed is the classical limit of quantum mechanics, which is approached by considering the product of energy and time scales relative to
���
\hbar
���
. In daily life, this product is typically much larger than
���
\hbar
���
, indicating classical behavior. However, understanding how classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics in this limit can be complex and is a fundamental topic in theoretical physics.
These axioms encapsulate the conceptual transition from classical to quantum mechanics, highlighting how quantum mechanics redefines our understanding of physical systems through its unique mathematical structure and principles. The text sets up a foundational framework for exploring further how these principles manifest in physical phenomena and experimental outcomes.

1.2.2Principles of measurement theory 
The above axioms characterize the mathematical structure of a quantum theory, 
but they don���t address the ���measurement problem���. This is the question of 
how to apply this structure to a physical system interacting with some sort 
of macroscopic, human-scale experimental apparatus that ���measures��� what is 
going on. This is a highly thorny issue, requiring in principle the study of two 
interacting quantum systems (the one being measured, and the measurement 
apparatus) in an overall state that is not just the product of the two states, 
but is highly ���entangled��� (for the meaning of this term, see chapter 9). Since a 
macroscopic apparatus will involve something like 1023degrees of freedom, this 
question is extremely hard to analyze purely within the quantum mechanical 
4 
framework (requiring for instance the solution of a Schr�� odinger equation in 1023 
variables). 
Instead of trying to resolve in general this problem of how macroscopic clas- 
sical physics behavior emerges in a measurement process, one can adopt the 
following two principles as providing a phenomenological description of what 
will happen, and these allow one to make precise statistical predictions using 
quantum theory: 
Principle (Observables). States for which the value of an observable can be 
characterized by a well-def i ned number are the states that are eigenvectors for 
the corresponding self-adjoint operator. The value of the observable in such a 
state will be a real number, the eigenvalue of the operator. 
This principle identif i es the states we have some hope of sensibly associating 
a label to (the eigenvalue), a label which in some contexts corresponds to an 
observable quantity characterizing states in classical mechanics. The observ- 
ables with important physical signif i cance (for instance the energy, momentum, 
angular momentum, or charge) will turn out to correspond to some group action 
on the physical system.

Expanded Explanation of the Principles of Measurement Theory in Quantum Mechanics
The text introduces two key principles related to measurement theory in quantum mechanics, contextualizing how quantum theory translates into observable phenomena in experimental setups. Let's explore these concepts in more detail:
1.
Challenges Posed by the Measurement Problem
Measurement Problem
: This fundamental issue in quantum mechanics arises when attempting to describe how quantum systems interact with measurement apparatuses, which are typically macroscopic and involve a vast number of particles (e.g., on the order of
1
0
23
10^{23}
1
0
23
). The complexity of describing such interactions using quantum mechanics alone, especially given the entangled nature of states in quantum systems, is immensely challenging.
Macroscopic Scale and Entanglement
: Quantum systems, when measured, do not exist in isolation but interact with the measuring device, leading to states that are not merely the sum of their individual parts but are entangled. This entanglement complicates the prediction of measurement outcomes because the overall system state involves interactions across an enormous number of degrees of freedom.
2.
Phenomenological Principles for Measurement
Observable-Eigenstate Correspondence
: The principle proposed simplifies the measurement problem phenomenologically by stating that only the states that are eigenvectors of a self-adjoint operator associated with an observable can have well-defined, observable values. These values are the eigenvalues of the operator, and measuring the observable yields one of these eigenvalues.
Real Values and Physical Observables
: The eigenvalues being real is crucial because it ensures that the measurements correspond to physically meaningful quantities (like energy or momentum). This principle aligns with the foundational axioms of quantum mechanics, where observables are represented by self-adjoint operators to guarantee real eigenvalues, thus observable physical realities.
3.
Role of Group Actions in Physical Observables
Group Theoretical Basis
: The measurement principle further suggests that significant physical observables are linked to group actions on the physical system. This ties into the broader framework where symmetries (described by group actions) play a pivotal role in defining the properties and conservation laws observed in quantum systems.
Implications and Further Considerations
Statistical Predictions
: While the principles do not solve the measurement problem in its entirety, they provide a framework for making statistical predictions about the outcomes of quantum measurements. This is a practical approach used in quantum mechanics to handle the complexities of state outcomes.
Interpretational Aspects
: The measurement problem also touches on deeper philosophical and interpretational issues in quantum mechanics, such as the nature of reality, the role of an observer, and how classical realities emerge from quantum probabilities.
This section of the text emphasizes a pragmatic approach to understanding how quantum measurements can be theoretically described and experimentally observed, focusing on the eigenstates and eigenvalues of observables within the quantum framework. It prepares the reader for a more detailed exploration of these topics in later chapters, particularly looking at how these principles play out in real-world quantum experiments and the theoretical implications for quantum mechanics.

Principle (The Born rule). Given an observable O and two unit-norm states 
|��1��� and |��2��� that are eigenvectors of O with distinct eigenvalues ��1and 
��2 
O|��1��� = ��1|��1���,O|��2��� = ��2|��2��� 
the complex linear combination state 
c1|��1��� + c2|��2��� 
will not have a well-def i ned value for the observable O.If one attempts to 
measure this observable, one will get either ��1or ��2, with probabilities 
|c2 1| 
|c2 1| + |c22| 
and |c2 2| 
|c2 1| + |c22| 
respectively. 
The Born rule is sometimes raised to the level of an axiom of the theory, but 
it is plausible to expect that, given a full understanding of how measurements 
work, it can be derived from the more fundamental axioms of the previous 
section. Such an understanding though of how classical behavior emerges in 
experiments is a very challenging topic, with the notion of ���decoherence��� playing 
an important role. See the end of this chapter for some references that discuss 
these issues in detail. 
Note that the state c|����� will have the same eigenvalues and probabilities as 
the state |�����, for any complex number c. It is conventional to work with states 
5 
of norm i xed to the value 1, which i xes the amplitude of c, leaving a remaining 
ambiguity which is a phase ei��. By the above principles this phase will not 
contribute to the calculated probabilities of measurements. We will however 
not take the point of view that this phase information can just be ignored. It 
plays an important role in the mathematical structure, and the relative phase 
of two dif f erent states certainly does af f ect measurement probabilities.

. These probabilities are derived from the magnitudes squared of the coefficients in the state's linear combination, reflecting how likely each outcome is based on the state's composition.
Significance of the Born Rule
Fundamental to Quantum Measurement
: The Born Rule is crucial because it quantitatively connects the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics (wave functions or state vectors) with the experimental outcomes observed in the laboratory. It allows for precise predictions of measurement probabilities.
Potential Derivability
: While the Born Rule is often considered an axiom due to its foundational role, there is ongoing discussion in the physics community about whether it could potentially be derived from more fundamental principles. This would deepen our understanding of quantum mechanics and provide a more unified theory.
Role of Decoherence
Decoherence
: The text hints at "decoherence" as a significant concept in understanding how quantum superpositions lead to definite outcomes observed in macroscopic systems. Decoherence describes how interactions with the environment cause a quantum system to "lose" its quantum properties (like superposition), resulting in classical behavior. This process helps explain the transition from quantum to classical outcomes, a pivotal area of research in quantum mechanics.
Importance of Quantum Phases
Phase Information
: The discussion also notes that while normalization of quantum states often ignores overall phase factors (since they do not affect probabilities), the relative phase between states in superpositions is crucial. These phases influence interference patterns and other quantum phenomena, indicating that phase information has significant physical implications.
Conclusion
The Born Rule and the principles surrounding it highlight the intricacies of quantum measurement and the challenges in bridging theory with empirical data. Understanding and potentially deriving the Born Rule from more fundamental axioms could mark a significant advancement in the field, reflecting a deeper grasp of the quantum world���s underlying nature. The role of decoherence in transitioning from quantum to classical is also pivotal, pointing to ongoing areas of research in quantum theory and measurement.

1.3Unitary group representations 
The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is closely related to what 
mathematicians describe as the theory of ���unitary group representations���. We 
will be examining this notion in great detail and working through many examples 
in coming chapters, but here is a quick summary of the general theory. 
1.3.1Lie groups 
A fundamental notion that appears throughout dif f erent i elds of mathematics 
is that of a group: 
Def i nition (Group). A group G is a set with an associative multiplication, such 
that the set contains an identity element, as well as the multiplicative inverse 
of each element. 
If the set has a i nite number of elements, this is called a ���f i nite group���. 
The theory of these and their use in quantum mechanics is a well-developed 
subject, but one we mostly will bypass in favor of the study of ���Lie groups���, 
which have an inf i nite number of elements. The elements of a Lie group make 
up a geometrical space of some dimension, and choosing local coordinates on the 
space, the group operations are given by dif f erentiable functions. Most of the Lie 
groups we will consider are ���matrix groups���, meaning subgroups of the group 
of n by n invertible matrices (with real or complex matrix entries). The group 
multiplication in this case is matrix multiplication. An example we will consider 
in great detail is the group of all rotations about a point in three dimensional 
space, in which case such rotations can be identif i ed with 3 by 3 matrices, with 
composition of rotations corresponding to multiplication of matrices. 
Digression. A standard def i nition of a Lie group is as a smooth manifold, with 
group laws given by smooth (inf i nitely dif f erentiable) maps. More generally, one 
might consider topological manifolds and continuous maps, but this gives nothing 
new (by the solution to Hilbert���s Fifth problem). Most of the i nite dimensional 
Lie groups of interest are matrix Lie groups, which can be def i ned as closed 
subgroups of the group of invertible matrices of some i xed dimension.One 
particular group of importance in quantum mechanics (the metaplectic group, 
see chapter 20) is not a matrix group, so the more general def i nition is needed 
to include this case.

Overview of Unitary Group Representations in Quantum Mechanics
The segment introduces the concept of unitary group representations, which are crucial in understanding the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key elements from the text:
1.
Lie Groups and Their Role in Quantum Mechanics
Definition of a Group
: At the foundational level, a group
G
G
G
is described as a set equipped with an associative multiplication operation, containing an identity element and where every element has a multiplicative inverse. Groups can be finite or infinite in number.
Lie Groups
: Unlike finite groups, Lie groups consist of an infinite number of elements and are pivotal in many areas of mathematics, including quantum mechanics. Lie groups are characterized by their continuous, differentiable structure, making them suitable for describing symmetries and dynamics in physical systems.
2.
Matrix Groups as Lie Groups
Matrix Groups
: Many Lie groups relevant to quantum mechanics are matrix groups, which are subgroups of invertible
n
��
n
n \times n
n
��
n
matrices (with real or complex entries). The operations of the group are performed through matrix multiplication, facilitating the application of these groups to physical phenomena, particularly rotations and transformations.
Example - Rotation Groups
: An essential example provided is the group of all rotations about a point in three-dimensional space, represented by
3
��
3
3 \times 3
3
��
3
rotation matrices. These matrices and their multiplications correspond to physical rotations, embodying a direct application of Lie group theory to quantum mechanics.
3.
Smooth Manifold and Differentiability
Smooth Manifolds
: A standard definition of a Lie group involves it being a smooth manifold, where the group operations are defined by smooth (infinitely differentiable) maps. This aspect is crucial as it ensures that the Lie group operations are well-defined and can be analyzed using calculus.
Importance of Closure
: In the context of matrix Lie groups, these groups are defined as closed subgroups of the group of invertible matrices, ensuring they are well-behaved mathematically and suitable for rigorous analysis.
4.
The Metaplectic Group
Beyond Matrix Groups
: While most Lie groups of interest in quantum mechanics can be represented as matrix groups, some, like the metaplectic group (discussed in a later chapter), cannot. This necessitates a more general definition of Lie groups to accommodate such cases, highlighting the diversity and complexity of structures involved in quantum theory.
Implications for Quantum Mechanics
The discussion underscores the profound relationship between the abstract mathematical concepts of Lie groups and practical applications in quantum mechanics. Lie groups provide a framework for understanding the symmetries and invariances in quantum systems, which are fundamental to formulating and solving physical problems, from the behavior of elementary particles to the properties of quantum fields.
In quantum mechanics, the representations of these groups (how the abstract group elements correspond to physical operations or transformations) are essential for developing a deep understanding of the system's behavior under various symmetries and transformations. This theory helps in predicting outcomes, designing experiments, and formulating further theories in physics.

1.3.2Group representations 
Groups often occur as ���transformation groups���, meaning groups of elements 
acting as transformations of some particular geometric object. In the example 
mentioned above of the group of three dimensional rotations, such rotations are 
linear transformations of R3. In general: 
Def i nition (Group action on a set). An action of a group G on a set M is 
given by a map (g,x) ��� G �� M ��� g �� x ��� M 
that takes a pair (g,x) of a group element g ��� G and an element x ��� M to 
another element g �� x ��� M such that 
g1�� (g2�� x) = (g1g2) �� x(1.2) 
and e �� x = x 
where e is the identity element of G 
A good example to keep in mind is that of three dimensional space M = R3 
with the standard inner product. This comes with two dif f erent group actions 
preserving the inner product 
��� An action of the group G1= R3on R3by translations. 
��� An action of the group G2= O(3) of three dimensional orthogonal trans- 
formations of R3.These are the rotations about the origin (possibly 
combined with a ref l ection). Note that in this case order matters: for 
non-commutative groups like O(3) one has g1g2��= g2g1for 
some group 
elements g1,g2. 
A fundamental principle of modern mathematics is that the way to under- 
stand a space M, given as some set of points, is to look at F(M), the set of 
functions on this space. This ���linearizes��� the problem, since the function space 
is a vector space, no matter what the geometrical structure of the original set 
is. If the set has a i nite number of elements, the function space will be a i nite 
dimensional vector space. In general though it will be inf i nite dimensional and 
one will need to further specify the space of functions (e.g., continuous functions, 
dif f erentiable functions, functions with i nite norm, etc.) under consideration. 
Given a group action of G on M, functions on M come with an action of G 
by linear transformations, given by 
(g �� f)(x) = f(g���1�� x)(1.3) 
where f is some function on M.

The study of group actions on function spaces also aids in understanding how quantum states transform under various symmetries and how these transformations affect the probabilities of different quantum outcomes, embodying the core principles of quantum mechanics and field theory.

The order in which elements of the group act may matter, so the inverse is 
needed to get the group action property 1.2, since 
g1�� (g2�� f)(x) = (g2�� f)(g���1 
1 �� x) 
= f(g���1 
2 �� (g���1 
1 �� x)) 
= f((g���1 
2 g���1 
1 ) �� x) 
= f((g1g2)���1�� x) 
= (g1g2) �� f(x) 
This calculation would not work out properly for non-commutative G if one 
def i ned (g �� f)(x) = f(g �� x). 
One can abstract from this situation and def i ne as follows a representation 
as an action of a group by linear transformations on a vector space: 
Def i nition (Representation). A representation (��,V ) of a group G is a homo- 
morphism �� : g ��� G ��� ��(g) ��� GL(V ) 
where GL(V ) is the group of invertible linear maps V ��� V , with V a vector 
space. 
Saying the map �� is a homomorphism means 
��(g1)��(g2) = ��(g1g2) 
for all g1,g2��� G, i.e., that it satisf i es the property needed to get a group action. 
We will mostly be interested in the case of complex representations, where V is a 
complex vector space, so one should assume from now on that a representation is 
complex unless otherwise specif i ed (there will be cases where the representations 
are real). 
When V is i nite dimensional and a basis of V has been chosen, then linear 
maps and matrices can be identif i ed (see the review of linear algebra in chapter 
4). Such an identif i cation provides an isomorphism 
GL(V ) ��� GL(n,C) 
of the group of invertible linear maps of V with GL(n,C), the group of invertible 
n by n complex matrices. We will begin by studying representations that are 
i nite dimensional and will try to make rigorous statements. Later on we will 
get to representations on function spaces, which are inf i nite dimensional, and 
will then often neglect rigor and analytical dif i culties. Note that only in the 
case of M a i nite set of points will we get an action by i nite dimensional 
matrices this way, since then F(M) will be a i nite dimensional vector space 
(C# of points in M). 
A good example to consider to understand this construction in the i nite 
dimensional case is the following: ��� Take M to be a set of 3 elements x1,x2,x3. So F(M) = C3. For f ��� 
F(M), f is a vector in C3, with components (f(x1),f(x2),f(x3)). 
��� Take G = S3, the group of permutations of 3 elements. This group has 
3! = 6 elements. 
��� Take G to act on M by permuting the 3 elements 
(g,xj) ��� g �� xj 
��� This group action provides a representation of G on F(M) by the linear 
maps (��(g)f)(xj) = f(g���1�� xj) 
Taking the standard basis of F(M) = C3, the j���th basis element will correspond 
to the function f that takes value 1 on xj, and 0 on the other two elements. 
With respect to this basis the ��(g) give six 3 by 3 complex matrices, which 
under multiplication of matrices satisfy the same relations as the elements of 
the group under group multiplication. In this particular case, all the entries of 
the matrix will be 0 or 1, but that is special to the permutation representation. 
A common source of confusion is that representations (��,V ) are sometimes 
referred to by the map ��, leaving implicit the vector space V that the matrices 
��(g) act on, but at other times referred to by specifying the vector space V , 
leaving implicit the map ��. One reason for this is that the map �� may be the 
identity map: often G is a matrix group, so a subgroup of GL(n,C), acting 
on V ��� Cnby 
the standard action of matrices on vectors. One should keep 
in mind though that just specifying V is generally not enough to specify the 
representation, since it may not be the standard one. For example, it could very 
well be the trivial representation on V , where 
��(g) = 1n 
i.e., each element of G acts on V as the identity.

1.3.3Unitary group representations 
The most interesting classes of complex representations are often those for which 
the linear transformations ��(g) are ���unitary���, preserving the notion of length 
given by the standard Hermitian inner product, and thus taking unit vectors to 
unit vectors. We have the def i nition: 
Def i nition (Unitary representation). A representation (��,V ) on a complex vec- 
tor space V with Hermitian inner product �����,����� is a unitary representation if it 
preserves the inner product, i.e., 
�����(g)v1,��(g)v2��� = ���v1,v2��� 
for all g ��� G and v1,v2��� V . 9 
For a unitary representation, the matrices ��(g) take values in a subgroup 
U(n) ��� GL(n,C). In our review of linear algebra (chapter 4) we will see that 
U(n) can be characterized as the group of n by n complex matrices U such that 
U���1= U��� 
where U���is the conjugate-transpose of U. Note that we���ll be using the notation 
��������� to mean the ���adjoint��� or conjugate-transpose matrix. This notation is pretty 
universal in physics, whereas mathematicians prefer to use ��������� instead of ���������.

1.4Representations and quantum mechanics 
The fundamental relationship between quantum mechanics and representation 
theory is that whenever we have a physical quantum system with a group G 
acting on it, the space of states H will carry a unitary representation of G (at 
least up to a phase factor ambiguity). For physicists working with quantum 
mechanics, this implies that representation theory provides information about 
quantum mechanical state spaces when G acts on the system. For mathemati- 
cians studying representation theory, this means that physics is a very fruitful 
source of unitary representations to study: any physical system with a group G 
acting on it will provide one. 
For a representation �� and group elements g that are close to the identity, 
exponentiation can be used to write ��(g) ��� GL(n,C) as 
��(g) = eA 
where A is also a matrix, close to the zero matrix. We will study this situation 
in much more detail and work extensively with examples, showing in particular 
that if ��(g) is unitary (i.e., in the subgroup U(n) ��� GL(n,C)), then A will be 
skew-adjoint: A���= ���A 
where A���is the conjugate-transpose matrix. Def i ning B = iA, we i nd that B 
is self-adjoint B���= B 
We thus see that, at least in the case of i nite dimensional H, the unitary 
representation �� of G on H coming from an action of G on our physical sys- 
tem gives us not just unitary matrices ��(g), but also corresponding self-adjoint 
operators B on H. Lie group actions thus provide us with a class of quantum 
mechanical observables, with the self-adjointness property of these operators 
corresponding to the unitarity of the representation on state space. It is a re- 
markable fact that for many physical systems the class of observables that arise 
in this way include the ones of most physical interest. 
In the following chapters we���ll see many examples of this phenomenon. A 
fundamental example that we will study in detail is that of action by translation 
in time. Here the group is G = R (with the additive group law) and we get 
10 
a unitary representation of R on the space of states H.The 
corresponding 
self-adjoint operator is the Hamiltonian operator H (divided by ���) and the 
representation is given by t ��� R ��� ��(t) = e��� 
i ���Ht 
which one can check is a group homomorphism from the additive group R to a 
group of unitary operators. This unitary representation gives the dynamics of 
the theory, with the Schr�� odinger equation 1.1 just the statement that ��� 
i ���H���t 
is the skew-adjoint operator that gets exponentiated to give the unitary trans- 
formation that moves states ��(t) ahead in time by an amount ���t. 
One way to construct quantum mechanical state spaces H is as ���wavefunc- 
tions���, meaning complex-valued functions on space-time. Given any group ac- 
tion on space-time, we get a representation �� on the state space H of such 
wavefunctions by the construction of equation 1.3. Many of the representations 
of interest will however not come from this construction, and we will begin our 
study of the subject in the next few chapters with such examples, which are 
simpler because they are i nite dimensional. In later chapters we will turn to 
representations induced from group actions on space-time, which will be inf i nite

1.5Groups and symmetries 
The subject we are considering is often described as the study of ���symmetry 
groups���, since the groups may occur as groups of elements acting by transfor- 
mations of a space M preserving some particular structure (thus, a ���symmetry 
transformation���). We would like to emphasize though that it is not necessary 
that the transformations under consideration preserve any particular structure. 
In the applications to physics, the term ���symmetry��� is best restricted to the 
case of groups acting on a physical system in a way that preserves the equations 
of motion (for example, by leaving the Hamiltonian function unchanged in the 
case of a classical mechanical system). For the case of groups of such symme- 
try transformations, the use of the representation theory of the group to derive 
implications for the behavior of a quantum mechanical system is an important 
application of the theory. We will see however that the role of representation 
theory in quantum mechanics is quite a bit deeper than this, with the overall 
structure of the theory determined by group actions that are not symmetries 
(in the sense of not preserving the Hamiltonian). 
1.6For further reading 
We will be approaching the subject of quantum theory from a dif f erent direc- 
tion than the conventional one, starting with the role of symmetry and with the 
simplest possible i nite dimensional quantum systems, systems which are purely 
11 
quantum mechanical, with no classical analog. This means that the early dis- 
cussion found in most physics textbooks is rather dif f erent from the one here. 
They will generally include the same fundamental principles described here, but 
often begin with the theory of motion of a quantized particle, trying to motivate 
it from classical mechanics. The state space is then a space of wavefunctions, 
which is inf i nite dimensional and necessarily brings some analytical dif i culties. 
Quantum mechanics is inherently a quite dif f erent conceptual structure than 
classical mechanics. The relationship of the two subjects is rather complicated, 
but it is clear that quantum mechanics cannot be derived from classical me- 
chanics, so attempts to motivate it that way are unconvincing, although they 
correspond to the very interesting historical story of how the subject evolved. 
We will come to the topic of the quantized motion of a particle only in chapter 
10, at which point it should become much easier to follow the standard books. 
There are many good physics quantum mechanics textbooks available, aimed 
at a wide variety of backgrounds, and a reader of this book should look for one 
at an appropriate level to supplement the discussions here. One example would 
be [81], which is not really an introductory text, but it includes the physicist���s 
version of many of the standard calculations we will also be considering. Some 
useful textbooks on the subject aimed at mathematicians are [20], [41], [43], [57], 
and [91]. The i rst few chapters of [28] provide an excellent while very concise 
summary of both basic physics and quantum mechanics. One important topic 
we won���t discuss is that of the application of the representation theory of i nite 
groups in quantum mechanics. For this as well as a discussion that overlaps quite 
a bit with the point of view of this book while emphasizing dif f erent topics, see 
[85]. For another textbook at the level of this one emphasizing the physicist���s 
point of view, see [107]. 
For the dif i cult issue of how measurements work and how classical physics 
emerges from quantum theory, an important part of the story is the notion of 
���decoherence���. Good places to read about this are Wojciech Zurek���s updated 
version of his 1991 Physics Today article [111], as well as his more recent work 
on ���quantum Darwinism��� [112].There is an excellent book on the subject 
by Schlosshauer [75] and for the details of what happens in real experimental 
setups, see the book by Haroche and Raimond [44]. For a review of how classical 
physics emerges from quantum physics written from the mathematical point of 
view, see Landsman [54]. Finally, to get an idea of the wide variety of points 
of view available on the topic of the ���interpretation��� of quantum mechanics, 
there���s a volume of interviews [76] with experts on the topic. 
The topic of Lie groups and their representation theory is a standard part 
of the mathematical curriculum at a more advanced level. As we work through 
examples in later chapters we���ll give references to textbooks covering this ma- 
terial.

While typically associated with preserving symmetrical properties, representation theory in quantum mechanics often explores deeper, influencing the overall structure of the theory through actions that may not directly preserve the Hamiltonian.
2. Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics
Divergence from Classical Motivations
: The text mentions that quantum mechanics is introduced differently than in traditional physics textbooks, which often derive quantum concepts from classical mechanics. Instead, the approach here starts with symmetries and simple finite-dimensional quantum systems that lack classical analogs.
Complexity of Infinite Dimensions

The Group U(1) and its 
Representations 
The simplest example of a Lie group is the group of rotations of the plane, with 
elements parametrized by a single number, the angle of rotation ��. It is useful 
to identify such group elements with unit vectors ei��in the complex plane. 
The group is then denoted U(1), since such complex numbers can be thought 
of as 1 by 1 unitary matrices . We will see in this chapter how the general 
picture described in chapter 1 works out in this simple case. State spaces will 
be unitary representations of the group U(1), and we will see that any such 
representation decomposes into a sum of one dimensional representations. These 
one dimensional representations will be characterized by an integer q, and such 
integers are the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator we will call Q, which is an 
observable of the quantum theory. 
One motivation for the notation Q is that this is the conventional physics 
notation for electric charge, and this is one of the places where a U(1) group 
occurs in physics. Examples of U(1) groups acting on physical systems include: 
��� Quantum particles can be described by a complex-valued ���wavefunction��� 
(see chapter 10), and U(1) acts on such wavefunctions by pointwise phase 
transformations of the value of the function. This phenomenon can be 
used to understand how particles interact with electromagnetic i elds, and 
in this case the physical interpretation of the eigenvalue of the Q operator 
will be the electric charge of the state. We will discuss this in detail in 
chapter 45. 
��� If one chooses a particular direction in three dimensional space, then the 
group of rotations about that axis can be identif i ed with the group U(1). 
The eigenvalues of Q will have a physical interpretation as the quantum 
version of angular momentum in the chosen direction. The fact that such 
eigenvalues are not continuous, but integral, shows that quantum angular 
momentum has quite dif f erent behavior than classical angular momentum. 
13 
��� When we study the harmonic oscillator (chapter 22) we will i nd that it 
has a U(1) symmetry (rotations in the position-momentum plane), and 
that the Hamiltonian operator is a multiple of the operator Q for this 
case. This implies that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (which give 
the energy of the system) will be integers times some i xed value. When 
one describes multi-particle systems in terms of quantum i elds one i nds 
a harmonic oscillator for each momentum mode, and then the Q for that 
mode counts the number of particles with that momentum. 
We will sometimes refer to the operator Q as a ���charge��� operator, assigning a 
much more general meaning to the term than that of the specif i c example of 
electric charge. U(1) representations are also ubiquitous in mathematics, where 
often the integral eigenvalues of the Q operator will be called ���weights���. 
In a very real sense, the reason for the ���quantum��� in ���quantum mechanics��� 
is precisely because of the role of U(1) groups acting on the state space. Such 
an action implies observables that characterize states by an integer eigenvalue 
of an operator Q, and it is this ���quantization��� of observables that motivates the 
name of the subject.

is sometimes more broadly referred to as the "charge" operator, encompassing various quantifiable properties of quantum states across different systems.
5. Conceptual Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
Quantization and Naming
: The quantization inherent in the U(1) representations���where observables are characterized by integral eigenvalues���profoundly influences the foundational concepts of quantum mechanics. This discrete nature of observable quantities under U(1) actions is a core reason for the term "quantum" in quantum mechanics.
Conclusion
The U(1) group and its representations furnish a critical framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of quantum systems. By illustrating the integral and discrete nature of certain physical properties, U(1) helps bridge observations with theory, providing a quantifiable and predictable structure to quantum mechanics. This makes U(1) not only foundational in theoretical physics but also essential in practical applications across various fields of quantum research.
