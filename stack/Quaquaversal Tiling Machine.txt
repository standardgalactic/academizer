Summarize: The Quantum House Of Cards 
Xavier Waintal1 
1Universit�� e Grenoble Alpes, PHELIQS, CEA, Grenoble INP, IRIG, Grenoble 38000, France��� 
Quantum computers have been proposed to solve a number of important problems such as discov- 
ering new drugs, new catalysts for fertilizer production, breaking encryption protocols, optimizing 
i nancial portfolios, or implementing new artif i cial intelligence applications. Yet, to date, a sim- 
ple task such as multiplying 3 by 5 is beyond existing quantum hardware. This article examines 
the dif i culties that would need to be solved for quantum computers to live up to their promises. 
I discuss the whole stack of technologies that has been envisioned to build a quantum computer 
from the top layers (the actual algorithms and associated applications) down to the very bottom 
ones (the quantum hardware, its control electronics, cryogeny, etc.) while not forgetting the crucial 
intermediate layer of quantum error correction. 
Introduction 
I am very skeptical that a quantum computer will ever 
solve serious problems. When I express these doubts to 
colleagues, the answer I mostly get is a variation along 
the line of the following: ���You���re right, it looks dif i cult. 
But when the i rst transistor was built, one could never 
have foreseen the computer revolution, internet, smart- 
phones, AI... Quantum bits might be the new transistor.��� 
This is a very compelling argument. In fact, some qubits 
are actually made of transistors [1]. Such analogies can 
be very striking, yet they can also be very deceptive as 
we are naturally inclined to use the one that i ts our pur- 
pose best. Other analogies compare quantum computing 
with the early days of aviation or the qubit with the brick 
with which we eventually built skyscrapers. I i nd that 
these analogies miss a crucial dif f erence between quan- 
tum computing and earlier technologies: the brick, the 
airplane, and the +1 Volt/ -1 Volt state of the transistor 
are all intrinsically robust. Qubits are much closer to a 
deck of cards than to a brick. Could we have built our 
skyscrapers with cards? Probably not, the house of cards 
technology lacks robustness. Quantum technologies are 
also, almost by def i nition, the opposite of robust; they 
rely on subtle, volatile, transient physical ef f ects. They 
intend to prevent a macroscopic object from behaving 
classically. Every single player in the game, be it a vi- 
bration, an electromagnetic mode, or a nearby charge 
wants the quantum computer to behave like a classical 
object; this is decoherence [2]. Trying to build a quan- 
tum computer means picking up a i ght with the second 
law of thermodynamics. The entropy of the system can- 
not be allowed to increase or the quantum state is simply 
gone. 
The goal of this article is to dispel a few myths around 
quantum computers, and coldly examine what it would 
take to build one. I will point out the dif f erent challenges 
that lie on the path to building a quantum computer, the 
leading one being the exponential decay of the i delity

due to decoherence. I will also discuss the envisioned ap- 
plications of quantum computing and the extraordinary 
constraints that they put on quantum hardware. As far 
as I am aware, the statements written below are not par- 
ticularly controversial, at least to the scientif i c experts in 
the i eld. Depending on the reader���s background, some 
of these statements might be obvious, some of them new. 
Taken together, they provide a global picture that should 
help one to make an informed opinion on the main ques- 
tion of the i eld: Will it work? 
As advertized in the i rst sentence, the author of this 
review is very skeptical about the prospects of quantum 
computing.It should be stressed, however, that this 
skepticism does not extend to quantum physics in gen- 
eral or to other aspects of quantum technologies. The 
revolution going on in experimental quantum physics is 
genuine. What is unclear, in my opinion, is the possibility 
to use this progress to perform new types of computation.

"The Quantum House of Cards" by Xavier Waintal critically examines the challenges and potential of quantum computing. Waintal expresses skepticism about the practicality of quantum computers in solving significant problems, despite their proposed applications in fields like drug discovery, encryption, and artificial intelligence. The article highlights the inherent fragility and complexity of quantum bits (qubits), comparing them to a deck of cards rather than robust bricks, indicating their vulnerability to decoherence and the difficulty in maintaining their quantum state.
Waintal discusses the entire technology stack required for quantum computing, from algorithms to hardware, emphasizing the challenges in each layer, particularly quantum error correction. He draws parallels between the development of quantum computing and historical technological advances like the transistor, but also notes the unique challenges of quantum technology, which, unlike earlier technologies, is intrinsically non-robust and relies on subtle, transient physical effects.
The article aims to dispel myths about quantum computing and realistically assess what it would take to build a functional quantum computer. Waintal points out the exponential decay of fidelity due to decoherence as a primary challenge and questions the feasibility of quantum computing's proposed applications given the current technological constraints. While acknowledging the ongoing revolution in experimental quantum physics, Waintal remains doubtful about the application of these advancements in computing, differentiating his skepticism about quantum computing from quantum physics and other quantum technologies.

The fundamental law of analog machines 
At the root of this analysis is the simple observation 
that a quantum computer is an analog machine [3], i.e. 
its internal state is described by a large set of complex 
numbers that can vary continuously. This is in contrast 
to digital machines, like our desktop computers, whose 
internal states are described by bits that can take two 
(macroscopically distinct) values: zero and one. Micro- 
electronics experts know very well that it is very dif i cult

to perform long calculations with analog machines be- 
cause every operation is executed with a i nite precision. 
The same limitation applies to operations on quantum 
bits: For instance, we might want to rotate one by 40 
degrees around the z-axis, but instead end up doing a 
40.1 degree rotation around a slightly tilted axis. These 
errors accumulate, and eventually the internal state of 
the quantum computer becomes blurred. 
We measure the global precision that we have achieved 
with a quantity called the i delity F [4]. One can think 
of the i delity as the probability for the result of the full 
calculation to be correct. The i delity decreases exponen- 
tially as, F ��� e�����0N0�����1N1�����2N2���...(1) 
where ��1is the error per one qubit operation and N1the 
number of such operations. Similarly, ��2and N2refer 
to the error level for operations that couple two qubits. 
There exist also other error channels (e.g. measurement 
errors, leakage errors, etc.) not discussed here. Interest- 
ingly, the phenomena of decoherence occur even when we 
do nothing, so that we have to introduce the error level 
��0for the N0idle times as well. Physically, ��0N0is essen- 
tially given by ��0N0��� nT/T2where 
n is the number of 
qubits, T the duration of the calculation and T2the phase 
coherence time of the quantum hardware. Since T scales 
at least as n for non-trivial calculations (much faster in 
the case of e.g. Grover algorithm), it follows that the i- 
delity decreases at least as fast as F ��� exp(���an2) 
(a is a 
constant). The error levels ��1and ��2include, in addition 
to decoherence, the errors due to the act of manipulating 
the qubits such as the i nite precision of the amplitude 
and duration of the microwave pulses or the ef f ect of e.g. 
crosstalks. There is a tremendous level of evidence, both 
theoretical and experimental, for the validity of (1); it 
is actually used to benchmark the quality of the qubits. 
Perhaps the most compelling validation so far of (1) is the 
seminal Google experiment of ���quantum supremacy��� [5]. 
Indeed, if one sets aside the supremacy claim, what this 
experiment really does is establishing that (1) actually 
holds for a rather large system of n = 53 quantum bits. 
Typical values shown by the best existing hardware are 
around ��1��� 0.0001 and ��2��� 0.002. The numbers N0, 
N1, N2depend on the type of application, and on the 
size of the problem, i.e. the number of quantum bits n 
that will have to be used. For a given problem, one may 
use (1) to evaluate the probability of success on given 
hardware.

The excerpt from the paper discusses the fundamental nature of quantum computers as analog machines and the implications of this for their precision and fidelity. The key points are:
Analog Nature of Quantum Computers
: Unlike digital machines, which use discrete bits (0 or 1), a quantum computer's internal state is described by a large set of complex numbers that vary continuously. This analog characteristic presents unique challenges.
Finite Precision of Operations
: In quantum computing, operations on quantum bits (qubits) are executed with finite precision. For example, an intended 40-degree rotation around an axis might slightly deviate in angle or axis. These small errors accumulate over time, blurring the internal state of the quantum computer.
Fidelity (F)
: The global precision achieved in a quantum computer is measured by a quantity called fidelity (F), which can be thought of as the probability of obtaining a correct result from the entire calculation. Fidelity decreases exponentially with errors and operations.
Error Accumulation Formula

is significant and increases with the number of qubits and duration of the calculation.
Challenges of Scaling
: Since the calculation duration generally scales with the number of qubits, fidelity decreases rapidly as the number of qubits increases. This scaling problem poses a significant challenge for complex, large-scale quantum computations.
Benchmarking with Experimental Evidence
: The validity of this fidelity model is supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence, and it is used to benchmark the quality of qubits. The Google "quantum supremacy" experiment is cited as a compelling validation of this model for a system of 53 qubits.
Application-Specific Implications
: The probability of successfully executing a quantum computing task can be estimated using the fidelity equation. However, the success probability depends on the specific application and the number of qubits involved.
In summary, the paper highlights the critical challenges in quantum computing due to its analog nature, particularly the accumulation of errors and the rapid decrease in fidelity, which are major obstacles in scaling up quantum computers for practical applications.

The fruits are few and not hanging low 
There is a small paradox attached to quantum com- 
puting with respect to applications. The way it has been 
presented to the public, there exists a large number of 
them, with dazzling implications. It has been claimed 
that quantum computers would help with food produc- 
tion by designing new catalyzers for fertilizer produc- 
tion; they would allow one to design new drugs or chem- 
icals; they would play a major role in (quantum) ma- 
chine learning; they would address cryptographic secu- 
rity problems...On the other hand, at the moment, only 
a handful of separate quantum algorithms exist. In fact, 
all the above mentionned applications use variations on 
these few algorithms. This is in sharp contrast to classi- 
cal computing where it is relatively easy to design a new 
algorithm and there exists an almost unlimited number 
of them. The contrast remains even after taking into ac- 
count the relative size and age of the two i elds: there is 
no simple path to write a new quantum algorithm. Also, 
as we shall see, all known algorithms are very demanding 
in terms of hardware quality and quantity. 
The most famous one is Shor���s algorithm that solves 
the factoring problem [6]. Given a large integer c = ab 
of n bits, it calculates the two factors a and b. Its im- 
portance stems from the fact that, because this problem 
was believed to be exponentially hard, it is at the root of 
the RSA encryption system that is used throughout the 
internet. So someone in possession of a quantum com- 
puter could eavesdrop on internet communications that 
are supposed to be secure. Because this threat has been 
taken seriously, new encryption protocols, proven to be 
quantum resilient, will soon be deployed to replace RSA. 
Considering only two-qubit gate error, N2��� 10n3for 
Shor���s algorithm. Breaking RSA for realistic key sizes 
would imply factoring numbers represented by n = 2048 
bits. From F ��� e�����210n 
3, we obtain that one would need 
��2��� 10���11for 
the algorithm to succeed with a reasonably 
high probability. This would require an improvement by 
a factor of one billion with respect to the current exper- 
imental state of the art. In the particular case of Shor���s 
algorithm, the ef f ect of noise can be put onto i rm math- 
ematical grounds [7]. 
Second after Shor comes Grover. Grover���s algorithm 
[8] provides a more modest speed-up than Shor���s, at most 
quadratic from 2ndown to ���2n operations. It is however 
widely popular because in contrast to Shor���s algorithm, 
which is highly specialized, Grover can be applied to a 
wide variety of problems including the dif i cult ���NP com- 
plete��� class. Its applicability is however questionable [9] 
since it requires an exponentially large number of oper- 
ations to complete, hence the i delity decays as the ex- 
ponential of an exponential: F ��� e�����2n 
���2n . Solving a 
n = 100 instance (where it is expected to become faster 
than its classical analogue in the most favorable situa- 
tion) would require ��2��� 10���17not 
to mention an unin- 
terrupted computation of thousands of years [9]. Using 
existing technologies, it is actually not possible to apply 
Grover reliably on just 5 qubits. A recent attempt that 
used advanced noise mitigation techniques (not applica- 
ble to large systems) obtained the correct answer with 
just 15% probability [10]. Beyond the dif i culty to run 
Grover���s algorithm in practice, a widely overlooked as- 
pect is that a quantum advantage can only be obtained 
for the most unstructured problems. Real life problems 
almost always possess a lot of structure that classical algorithms take advantage of for dramatic speed-up [4, 9]. 
Many proposals for quantum advantage are rather naive 
in that respect. 
The third class of algorithm does not provide a quan- 
tum speed-up in theory, but the hope is that it might 
provide one in practice.Among the possible applica- 
tions, one that has attracted a very large interest is the 
possibility to construct variational ansatz to solve prob- 
lems arising in quantum chemistry, e.g.calculate the 
activation energy for a chemical reaction and the inf l u- 
ence of potential catalysts. The gate count N2is directly 
linked to the expressivity of the ansatz; in order to reach 
a suf i cient (so called ���chemical���) accuracy, one needs 
to include at least excitations with three electron-holes 
[11] (which translates into N2��� n6) 
and a large i delity 
F ��� 0.999. For a n = 30 electron problem accessible to 
most classical techniques, one arrives at ��2��� 10���12[12].

This section of the paper addresses the paradoxical situation in quantum computing concerning its applications and the challenges in developing quantum algorithms. Key points include:
Perceived Versus Actual Applications
: Quantum computing is often presented as having numerous dazzling applications, such as improving food production, drug design, quantum machine learning, and cryptographic security. However, in reality, only a few distinct quantum algorithms exist, and most proposed applications are variations of these algorithms. This is in contrast to classical computing, where designing new algorithms is relatively easy and there is an abundance of them.
Challenges in Writing Quantum Algorithms
: Writing new quantum algorithms is not straightforward, partly due to the complexity and the high demands these algorithms place on hardware in terms of quality and quantity.
Shor���s Algorithm
: This well-known algorithm addresses the factoring problem and has implications for RSA encryption, which underpins internet security. However, to break RSA encryption with key sizes used in practice (e.g., 2048 bits), an error rate (��2) of less than 10^(-11) is required, which is a billion times better than the current state of the art. The noise effects in Shor's algorithm can be mathematically quantified.
Grover���s Algorithm
: Grover's algorithm offers a more modest speed-up (quadratic) and can be applied to a wide variety of problems, including NP-complete class problems. However, its practical applicability is questionable due to the requirement of an exponentially large number of operations. For instance, solving a 100-instance problem would require an error rate (��2) of less than 10^(-17) and an impractically long uninterrupted computation time.
Real-Life Problems and Quantum Advantage
: Most real-life problems have inherent structures that classical algorithms exploit for speed-up. Quantum advantage is mainly hypothesized for unstructured problems, making many proposals for quantum advantage somewhat naive.
Quantum Chemistry Applications
: Another class of algorithms focuses on quantum chemistry, such as calculating activation energy for chemical reactions. The complexity of these problems requires high gate counts (N2) and fidelity (F), making them challenging for current quantum technologies. For a 30-electron problem, an error rate (��2) of less than 10^(-12) would be necessary.
Overall, the section highlights the significant gap between the theoretical promises of quantum computing and the practical challenges in realizing these promises, especially in terms of developing effective quantum algorithms and meeting the stringent hardware requirements.

The above examples are actually very generic: to be 
useful, a quantum computer must be able to employ 
rather deep quantum circuits. This statement can actu- 
ally be put on i rm grounds since shallow circuits can be 
simulated on classical computers very ef i ciently [4, 13]. 
In return, this means that to be useful a quantum com- 
puter must present very low error levels to keep the suc- 
cess probability of the computation close to one. To most 
physicists the numbers above speak by themselves; it 
is not realistic to imagine this level of precision to be 
reached. Suppose one is playing darts with a 1m wide 
target. Putting several darts within a circle of 5 cm of 
diameter is accessible with a little work.Putting the 
darts inside the 2 mm center requires a lot of impressive 
work (this is where we are now, ��2= 0.002). For the 
above quantum algorithms to work, one needs to put all 
the darts within a 10���11m wide target. 
All attempts to use quantum hardware for applications 
have been so far restricted to very small problem sizes 
in order to evade the precision issue. For instance, the 
quantum circuit to perform 3��5 is still beyond the reach 
of existing chips and so is the quantum circuit to fac- 
torize 15.Indeed, in the seminal article where such a 
factorization has been advertized, the classical logic was 
pre-calculated on a classical computer in order to main- 
tain the gate count at a low enough level [14].Also, 
the above estimates assume perfect connectivity between 
all qubits. In practice, this is never achieved except for 
small systems and one should therefore expect additional 
overheads due to the need of shuf l ing qubits around. 
Finding applications where quantum computers could 
have a genuine advantage is dif i cult. However, there is a 
simple criterion that allows one to state what they won���t 
be able to do [15]. Under very optimistic resource usage 
assumptions, it takes a quantum computer hours or days 
to arrive at a solution that would be challenging for a 
classical computer [16, 17]. Since this solution encom- 
passes only a few tens of bits, it means that the informa- 
tion throughput that such a quantum computer would 
deliver is a few tens of bits per hour which translates 
into less than a milli-byte per second, i.e. twelve orders of 
magnitude less than what any laptop routinely provides 
(gigabytes per seconds). In other words, quantum com- 
puters deliver very few bits of information. These might 
be very useful bits but still they will be very few, so quan- 
tum computers will always be restricted to highly specif i c 
applications; they will not replace classical computers. 
For instance a quantum computer could in principle be 
used to calculate the binding energy of a molecule (this 
can be stored in few bits) but will not be able to generate 
an image (this would require millions of logical qubits). 
Conversely, applications that require large inputs to be 
given to quantum computers, for instance an image for 
a quantum machine learning application, will require at 
least as large a gate count to load this information into 
the quantum hardware hence automatically require ultra 
low noise levels to keep the fidelity high enough.

This section elaborates on the practical challenges and limitations of quantum computers, emphasizing their need for deep quantum circuits and extremely low error levels. The key points are:
Need for Deep Quantum Circuits
: For a quantum computer to be useful, it must employ deep quantum circuits. Shallow circuits can be efficiently simulated on classical computers, so the real advantage of quantum computing lies in deeper circuits.
Challenges of Achieving Low Error Levels
: Quantum computers must have very low error levels to maintain a high success probability. The paper likens this to hitting an extremely small target in a game of darts. Current technology (with an error rate of ��2 = 0.002) is compared to hitting within a 2 mm center, but for quantum algorithms to be effective, one would need to hit a target less than 10^(-11) meters wide.
Limited Applications due to Precision Issues
: So far, quantum hardware has only been used for very small problems to avoid the issue of precision. Even simple calculations, like multiplying 3 by 5 or factoring 15, are beyond the capabilities of current quantum computers. The paper notes that in some demonstrations, much of the classical logic was pre-calculated on classical computers to keep the gate count low.
Connectivity Challenges
: The estimates discussed assume perfect connectivity between all qubits, which is rarely achieved in practice, especially for larger systems. This leads to additional complications and overheads.
Difficulty in Finding Advantageous Applications
: It's challenging to find applications where quantum computers have a genuine advantage. Under optimistic assumptions, quantum computers take hours or days to solve problems that are challenging for classical computers, but the information throughput is extremely low (a few tens of bits per hour).
Limited Scope of Applications
: Quantum computers will likely be limited to highly specific applications. They might be used for tasks that require only a few bits of information, like calculating the binding energy of a molecule, but not for tasks requiring large amounts of data, like image generation.
Input Size Constraints
: Applications that require large inputs, such as images for quantum machine learning, would necessitate a correspondingly large gate count. This, in turn, demands ultra-low noise levels to maintain high fidelity.
In summary, the paper underscores that quantum computers, despite their potential, face significant challenges in error rates, circuit depth, and practical applications. These factors currently limit their use to very specific, small-scale problems, and they are far from replacing classical computers in most applications.

The duality of good coupling vs. low decoherence 
On the physics side, every i eld of quantum physics has 
proposed one or more platforms on which one could try to 
realize a quantum computer. These dif f erent approaches 
can roughly be put on a scale from the ones best coupled 
to their environment (and hence can be manipulated ef i- 
ciently but also suf f er more from decoherence) to the least 
coupled ones (showcasing excellent coherence times but 
slow to manipulate). It is dif i cult to make an exhaustive 
list of what is being tried but one should keep in mind 
that optimizing one aspect is often done at the expense 
of another one and that the advantages of one approach 
often end up in being also a disadvantage. For instance, 
semiconducting approaches based e.g. on the spin of a 
single electron can provide very small qubits, hence the 
possibility to scale up to large systems. They also benef i t 
from the existence of proven fabrication technology. Yet 
their smallness also means that they are more sensitive 
to defects at the atomic scale, and therefore display high 
variability. For instance, a good CMOS technology has 
around 1011cm���1charges trapped at the silicon-oxyde 
interface of a transistor. This translates into variations 
of electric potential of several meV, not much smaller 
than the potential induced by the controlling electrostatic 
gates. Transistors that would be considered as nominally 
identical for microelectronics end up showing very large 
variations when used for qubits [18]. So far, only very 
limited quantum states have been demonstrated with this 
approach. Atomic physics based trapped ions have very 
small variability (all atoms are identical, only their en- 
vironment may l uctuate) and long coherence. Yet they 
are several orders of magnitude slower than their semi- 
conducting counterparts which almost disqualif i es them 
for a full scale implementation of quantum error correc- 
tion (see below). Also, it is not clear yet how to scale up 
these systems succesfully. Photons have extremely long 
coherence times. Yet, as they do not interact directly, the 
two-qubit gates are obtained by measuring auxiliary pho- 
tons (absorbed in a photodetector) and are intrinsically probabilistic. This means that one has, say, a 1/2 prob- 
ability of applying the gate and 1/2 probability of doing 
something else. The probability to apply the intended 
gate sequence decreases exponentially as one increases 
the gate count, which is very bad. Implementing an al- 
most deterministic noisy two-qubit gate between photons 
requires using a large number of auxiliary photons and a 
highly complex set of interferometers and photodetectors 
just to catch up with what other platforms do naturally. 
Besides, while important progress has been made in solid 
state photon sources, their yield and indistinguishability 
are at the �� ��� 0.1 level, still far from what would be 
needed. Other platforms, such as Rydberg atoms or elec- 
tronic l ying qubits [19] are emerging at various positions 
on the ���coupling to the environment��� spectrum. As of 
now, superconducting circuits seem to be a good compro- 
mise with a state of the art at around a hundred qubits 
and ��2��� 0.001. Notice that with this level of error, only 
a fraction of the qubits can be used reliably if one wants 
to retain a reasonably high i delity. 
Each i eld of quantum physics of f ers a rich variety 
of dif f erent sub-possibilities.For instance, within su- 
perconducting circuits [20], early designs included the 
quantronium after which came the transmon (now the de 
facto standard) but other designs include the l uxonium 
(with state of the art characteristics), the gatemon or the 
bosonic qubits (that aim at implementing, at least par- 
tially, quantum error correction at the hardware level). 
Extrapolating the pace at which progress is made is 
not straightforward. Progress is often linked to the ad- 
vent of disruptive ideas (e.g. the Cooper pair box, using 
a resonator as a harmonic oscillator, the transmon); the 
optimization part has been greatly accelerated by the 
large increase of resources devoted to quantum comput- 
ing in the last few years with some research teams grow- 
ing from a few persons to almost a thousand. The i rst 
demonstration of a ���qubit��� (i.e. coherent Rabi oscilla- 
tions) in a quantum circuit was made in 1999. The i rst 
two-qubit gate was made in 2009 with ��2��� 0.1 which 
was later improved to ��2��� 0.01 and reached ��2��� 0.001 
in 2020 (see Table I of [20] for references and details). 
At the time of this writing, IBM has announced that its 
chip can sustain the ��2��� 0.001 level with more than a 
hundred qubits [21].

This section delves into the complexities and trade-offs inherent in various quantum computing platforms, highlighting the duality between good coupling to the environment and low decoherence. Key points include:
Diverse Quantum Computing Platforms
: Various fields of quantum physics propose different platforms for quantum computing. These range from those that are well-coupled to their environment (enabling efficient manipulation but suffering from higher decoherence) to those with minimal coupling (resulting in longer coherence times but slower manipulation).
Trade-Offs in Different Approaches
: Each approach involves trade-offs, where optimizing one aspect often comes at the expense of another. Advantages in one area can simultaneously pose disadvantages in another.
Examples of Different Platforms
:
Semiconducting Approaches
: These offer small qubits and benefit from established fabrication technologies. However, their small size makes them sensitive to atomic-scale defects and results in high variability.
Trapped Ions
: Atomic physics-based trapped ions display minimal variability and long coherence times but are much slower than semiconducting counterparts, posing challenges for large-scale quantum error correction and scalability.
Photons
: Photons have very long coherence times but do not interact directly, making two-qubit gates intrinsically probabilistic and complex to implement.
Superconducting Circuits
: Currently, they represent a good compromise with about a hundred qubits and an error rate (��2) of approximately 0.001. However, only a fraction of the qubits can be used reliably to maintain high fidelity.
Variety within Each Platform
: Each field offers a range of sub-options. For example, in superconducting circuits, there are various designs like the quantronium, transmon (the de facto standard), fluxonium, gatemon, and bosonic qubits, each with its own characteristics and objectives.
Rate of Progress and Challenges
: The progression in the field is not linear and often hinges on disruptive ideas. The growth of resources devoted to quantum computing has accelerated optimization. The paper gives a brief history of progress in superconducting circuits, from the first demonstration of a qubit in 1999 to the implementation of two-qubit gates with progressively lower error rates.
Current State of the Art
: As of the writing of the paper, IBM had announced a chip capable of sustaining an error rate (��2) of about 0.001 with more than a hundred qubits.
The section underscores the intricate challenges in the development of quantum computing, emphasizing the need for balancing efficient qubit manipulation with the requirement to minimize decoherence.

The ���salvation is beyond the threshold��� myth 
The contrast between the i delities displayed by the 
quantum hardware and the requirements of the algo- 
rithms raises concerns about feasibility.The theoreti- 
cal solution to this problem is an elegant mathematical 
construction, the quantum error correction (QEC). In 
QEC, one performs two things: i rst, one encodes a logical 
qubit into nc> 1 physical ones so that no simple phys- 
ical process would directly couple the logical zero with 
the logical one. Second, one repeatedly performs partial 
quantum measurements that leave the logical qubit un- 
changed but force the system to stay in the intended part 
of the (now enlarged) Hilbert space [22]. A widely spread 
idea, backed up by some strong mathematical theorems, 
is that once the error levels fall below a certain threshold 
��th(that happens to be of the same order of magnitude 
as the current error level, ��th��� 0.01 for the best QEC 
codes), it becomes suf i cient to increase ncto obtain an 
exponential decrease of the error level ��Lof the logical 
qubit. QEC is often summarized with statements of the 
form ���We can anticipate that analog quantum simula- 
tors will eventually become obsolete. Because they are 
hard to control, they will be surpassed some day by dig- 
ital quantum simulators, which can be i rmly controlled 
using quantum error correction.���[23] or ���so, once the de- 
sired threshold is attainable, decoherence will not be an 
obstacle to scalable quantum computation.���[24] In short, 
QEC would turn an analog machine into an essentially digital one. However, QEC is itself entailed with considerable dif i culties that I now detail.

This section addresses the concept of quantum error correction (QEC) and its perceived role as a solution to the challenges faced by quantum computers. The key points are:
The Gap between Hardware Fidelities and Algorithm Requirements
: There is a significant contrast between the error rates achieved by current quantum hardware and the much lower error rates required by quantum algorithms. This gap raises questions about the practical feasibility of quantum computing.
Quantum Error Correction (QEC) as a Theoretical Solution
: QEC is a mathematical framework designed to overcome the issue of errors in quantum computing. It involves two key processes:
Encoding a logical qubit into multiple physical qubits, making it less susceptible to simple physical disturbances.
Performing repeated partial quantum measurements to keep the system within the intended part of the Hilbert space.
Threshold Theorem and Misconceptions
: A prevalent idea, supported by strong mathematical theorems, is that if the error levels of physical qubits fall below a certain threshold (��_th), increasing the number of physical qubits (nc) would lead to an exponential decrease in the logical qubit error level (��_L). This concept is often summarized by statements suggesting that once the threshold is reached, decoherence will no longer be an impediment to scalable quantum computation, essentially converting an analog quantum machine into a digital one.
Challenges with QEC
: Despite its theoretical appeal, QEC is not without its own significant difficulties, which the paper indicates will be discussed in detail. These challenges are likely related to the practical implementation of QEC, including the complexity of encoding and measuring processes, and the requirements for maintaining extremely low error rates.
In summary, the section points out the contrast between the current capabilities of quantum hardware and the stringent requirements of quantum algorithms. It introduces QEC as a theoretically elegant but practically challenging solution, highlighting common misconceptions about its ability to resolve the fundamental issues in quantum computing. The discussion suggests a deeper examination of QEC's complexities and limitations in the context of practical quantum computing applications.

The i rst dif i culty is that QEC is associated with im- 
portant overheads in terms of number of qubits and num- 
ber of operations. I refer to this as the Russian doll nest- 
ing problem. This name ref l ects the fact that manipu- 
lating logical qubits involves several levels of nestedness: 
operations within operations within operations. Suppose 
that one wants to perform a simple rotation of one logi- 
cal qubit by an angle 2��/64 around the z-axis (a typical 
rotation occuring e.g. in the quantum Fourier transform, 
a key component of Shor���s algorithm). To perform this 
rotation on a physical qubit is deceptively easy: one sim- 
ply needs to wait for the time it takes for the qubit to do 
this precession naturally. However, no such simple path 
can exist within QEC since, by construction, the logi- 
cal zero and one are widely dif f erent states and since we 
want this rotation to be performed with arbitrary preci- 
sion. Performing this simple rotation in what some have 
called a ���digital way��� (that is with an arbitrary high 
control on its precision), one decomposes it into several 
nested levels of operations. At the i rst level of the Rus- 
sian doll, the rotation is decomposed into a product of a 
few ultra-precise elementary operations. This is similar 
to approximating a real number with a fraction of two 
integers, the more precise one wants to be, the larger 
the integers or, in our case, the larger the number of 
elementary operations. Some of these elementary opera- 
tions will be relatively straightforward to implement, for 
instance they could amount to applying the same opera- 
tion to each of the ncqubits. At least one of them will be 
hard however. In the most studied QEC code (also one of 
the most robust), the so-called surface code [25], the hard 
gate is the ��/4 rotation along z, called T. In a second 
level, one needs to fabricate special ��/4 states very pre- 
cisely. This is done through a process called ���magic state 
distillation��� that is planned to occur in ���T gate facto- 
ries���. Magic state distillation is itself a sort of QEC code 
that possesses a i xed point that is precisely the intended 
state. Since it is done with logical states it is therefore a 
sort of QEC of QEC code. One or more iterations of the distillation are necessary before the required accuracy is 
achieved. To perform the distillation, one must entangle 
dif f erent logical qubits with each other. This is achieved 
within the third nested level of the Russian doll using a 
process known as ���braiding��� where the i rst logical qubit 
makes a complete loop around the second logical qubit. 
This loop is itself discretized in the fourth level of the doll 
where each discrete move of the qubit is intertwined with 
���syndrome measurements���: a small quantum circuit ran 
on the entire chip at every clock cycle to perform the 
partial measurements mentioned above. Needless to say, 
the Russian doll nesting problem transforms the initially 
simple process of a one qubit gate into thousands, tens 
of thousands or more, physical operations depending on 
the required level of precision. It is interesting to note 
that T seems to be a necessary evil. Indeed, it can be 
shown that quantum circuits that do not have the T gates 
can be simulated easily, in polynomial time on a classical 
computer [26]. The Russian doll bottleneck excludes all 
but the fastest hardware for practical applications. Even 
assuming gates as fast as 10ns, the overall computational 
time found for a full application often reaches days for a 
single answer to a single problem. It also imposes strin- 
gent constraints on the scalability as millions of qubits 
(billions once one includes the T gates factories) will be 
required [16].

This section discusses the challenges of implementing Quantum Error Correction (QEC), focusing on its complexity and the significant overhead it introduces. The key points are:
QEC Overheads
: QEC is associated with substantial overheads in terms of the number of qubits and operations required. This is referred to as the "Russian doll nesting problem," highlighting the multiple levels of complexity involved in manipulating logical qubits.
Example of a Simple Rotation
: To illustrate the complexity, the paper describes performing a simple rotation of a logical qubit by 2��/64 around the z-axis. While this is straightforward for a physical qubit, it becomes highly complex within QEC due to the need for arbitrary precision and the difference between logical zero and one states.
Nested Levels of Operations
: The rotation is decomposed into several ultra-precise elementary operations. Some of these operations are straightforward, but others, particularly the ��/4 rotation (T gate) in the surface code, are challenging.
Magic State Distillation
: To achieve the ��/4 rotation, a process called "magic state distillation" is used. This involves a form of QEC within QEC, requiring multiple iterations and the entanglement of different logical qubits.
Braiding and Syndrome Measurements
: The process of "braiding," where one logical qubit loops around another, is used along with syndrome measurements that involve running small quantum circuits on the entire chip at every clock cycle.
Implications of Complexity
: The initially simple process of a one-qubit gate is transformed into thousands or tens of thousands of physical operations, depending on the required level of precision. The necessity of the T gate (��/4 rotation) adds to the complexity, as circuits without T gates can be easily simulated on classical computers.
Limitations on Hardware and Scalability
: Due to the complexity and time required for these operations, only the fastest hardware is practical for applications. Even with gates as fast as 10ns, the computational time for a full application can reach days for a single answer. Additionally, scalability is constrained, with millions (or billions, including T gate factories) of qubits required.
In summary, the section outlines the formidable challenges in implementing QEC in quantum computing, highlighting the immense complexity and resource requirements. It underscores the practical difficulties of applying QEC, which significantly increases the operational and hardware demands, limiting the feasibility of quantum computing for complex tasks.

The second dif i culty I call the ���syndrome bottleneck���. 
At every single clock cycle (say every ��s for state of the 
art superconducting hardware), quantum error correc- 
tion requires partial measurements of the physical qubits 
in order to stabilize the logical qubits.The results of 
these measurements are the ���syndromes��� that need to 
be tracked and analyzed in real time in order to recon- 
struct what type of error may have occured and modify 
the rest of the circuit accordingly. There are (almost) 
as many syndromes as there are qubits.A single er- 
ror in the analysis of the syndrome jeopardizes the en- 
tire calculation. And the analysis of the syndrome is a 
dif i cult (NP-complete) problem. For a billion physical 
qubits quantum computer, the data rate coming from 
the syndromes is of the order of 1015bits per second 
(= 109/10���6s). Even assuming that very few operations 
per bit are needed for the analysis, this means that a 
petaf l op of computing power is required solely for the 
purpose of syndrome analysis.This is the computing 
power of a full scale supercomputer.Even more wor- 
ringly, there is a need to extract the 1015bits per second 
from the quantum chip, i.e. the equivalent of what goes 
through one million gigabit ethernet cables. 
The last dif i culty arises from the fact that not all er- 
rors have the same status. Indeed, a QEC code corrects 
certain types of errors. Others are not corrected and are 
fatal to the calculations. In the context of the surface 
code, the logical error takes the form 
��L��� ? 
��2 
��th ?���nc 
+ ��ncnc(2) 
where ��ncis the error level for non-correctable errors [27]. 
Hence increasing ncwill only improve the logical error 
until the non-correctable errors start to dominate. For 
each set of errors, one can probably build a code that cor- 
rects them all (but the more errors, the more complex the 
code and the worse the threshold). However, for a given 
code there will always be non-correctable errors. In QEC 
terminology, such errors are referred as correlated errors. 
However they are correlated only from a QEC point of 
view. From a physics standpoint they are just regular 
physical processes (for instance, a global l uctuation of 
magnetic i eld due to l uctuations of the current in the 
coil qualif i es). Some of these errors have already been 
identif i ed. Examples include the leakage of a qubit out- 
side of the intended computational space, a nearby two- 
level system that creates a memory ef f ect [28] or, more 
dramatically, a collision with a cosmic ray that appears 
to impair superconducting chips [29]. Fortunately in the 
latter case, it seems that burying the quantum computer 
under 1.4km of non-radioactive stone alleviates the prob- 
lem [30]. The bottom line is that if and when one starts 
to use QEC, one will only be able to obtain some gain in 
precision, not an arbitrary gain. After that, one will be 
dominated by a non-correctable error, hidden behind a 
large l ow of more mundane ones. One will need to i nd 
a way to isolate and then address this error (most prob- 
ably at a cost for the threshold) and only then one will 
be able to increase ncagain, until one will be hit by the 
next type of error. Given the precision targeted in the 
applications (��L��� 10���15once 
one takes into account the 
QEC overhead), it is not clear how far one will be able 
to go in practice.

This section discusses two additional significant challenges in implementing Quantum Error Correction (QEC) in quantum computing:
Syndrome Bottleneck
:
Real-Time Syndrome Analysis
: QEC requires partial measurements of physical qubits at every clock cycle to stabilize logical qubits. These measurements produce "syndromes" that must be tracked and analyzed in real time to identify and correct errors.
Computational Demands
: For a billion-qubit quantum computer, the data rate from syndromes is around 10^15 bits per second. Analyzing these syndromes in real time demands petaflop-scale computing power, equivalent to a full-scale supercomputer.
Data Extraction Challenge
: Extracting 10^15 bits per second from a quantum chip is a formidable task, akin to the bandwidth of one million gigabit Ethernet cables. This presents a huge logistical challenge in terms of data transfer and processing.
Unequal Status of Errors
:
Types of Errors
: QEC codes are designed to correct certain types of errors, but other errors are non-correctable and fatal to computations.
Logical Error Equation
: The logical error rate (��_L) is given by an equation involving the physical qubit error rate (��_2), the threshold error rate (��_th), and the number of physical qubits per logical qubit (nc). Increasing nc improves logical error rates only until non-correctable errors start to dominate.
Correlated Errors
: Some errors, termed "correlated" in QEC terminology, are regular physical processes that can't be corrected by QEC. Examples include qubit leakage, memory effects from nearby two-level systems, or external disruptions like cosmic ray collisions.
Addressing Non-Correctable Errors
: To further improve precision, it's necessary to isolate and address these non-correctable errors, which may require adjusting the threshold error rate and will inevitably lead to more complex QEC codes.
The section emphasizes the substantial difficulties in achieving the high precision required for practical quantum computing applications using QEC. It points out that while some precision gains are possible, they are limited by the occurrence of non-correctable errors, necessitating continuous adaptation and improvement of QEC codes. The combination of these challenges ��� the syndrome bottleneck, computational demands, data extraction requirements, and the need to address a continuous stream of non-correctable errors ��� significantly complicates the path to scalable and practical quantum computing.

Recent attempts [31, 32] to construct a surface code 
with superconducting qubits have shown a mitigated suc- 
cess. Up to nc= 25 has been considered. However, so far 
only the fourth level of the Russian doll nesting problem 
has been implemented, so that the logical qubit could 
not be manipulated. Also the logical qubit is still not as 
good as the original physical qubits from which it is con- 
structed.A real-time treatment of the syndromes has 
not been attempted so that syndrome analysis is done 
post mortem. This is i ne in a proof of principle exper- 
iment when one can post-select some experiments, but 
not usable for a real quantum computation. Last, in one 
of these experiments [31], signif i cant leakage occurs so 
that non-correctable errors can already not be ignored. 
The most complete attempt to implement all the stages 
of the Russian doll probably belongs to the trapped ion 
platform [33] using one of the simplest QEC codes (the 
nc= 7 Steane code). One logical T gate was applied on 
one logical qubit. However the magic state distillation 
stage was bypassed, the code was still vulnerable to a 
single qubit error on the ancilla qubit, only a (partial) 
single cycle of syndroms was measured, and it was an- 
alyzed post mortem through postselection.The result 
was a logical error ��L> 0.1, i.e. almost hundred time 
worse than the original single qubit error of the physical qubit. The best QEC gain so far was demonstrated for a single bosonic qubit in a 3D cavity where a gain of up to a factor two in the qubit error level was claimed with a logical ��0��� 0.002 per QEC cycle [34, 35].

This section discusses recent attempts to implement Quantum Error Correction (QEC) using superconducting qubits and trapped ions, highlighting the challenges and limited success achieved so far:
Surface Code with Superconducting Qubits
:
Limited Success
: Attempts to construct a surface code with superconducting qubits have shown only moderate success. Experiments have considered up to 25 physical qubits (nc = 25) for constructing a logical qubit.
Incomplete Implementation
: Only the fourth level of the Russian doll nesting problem has been implemented, meaning the logical qubit could not be actively manipulated.
Inferior Quality of Logical Qubits
: The quality of the constructed logical qubits is not yet as good as the original physical qubits from which they were made.
Post-Mortem Syndrome Analysis
: Real-time treatment of syndromes has not been attempted; syndrome analysis is performed post-mortem, which is suitable for proof-of-principle experiments but not for actual quantum computation.
Leakage and Non-Correctable Errors
: Significant leakage issues in one experiment indicated that non-correctable errors could not be ignored.
Trapped Ion Platform
:
Attempt with Steane Code
: The most comprehensive attempt to implement all stages of QEC was made on the trapped ion platform using the Steane code (nc = 7). A logical T gate was applied to a logical qubit.
Bypassing Magic State Distillation
: The experiment bypassed the magic state distillation stage, leaving the code vulnerable to single qubit errors on the ancilla qubit.
Partial and Post-Selected Analysis
: Only a partial single cycle of syndromes was measured, and the analysis was done post-mortem through post-selection.
High Logical Error Rate
: The result was a logical error rate (��_L) greater than 0.1, almost a hundred times worse than the error rate of the original single physical qubit.
Bosonic Qubit in a 3D Cavity
:
Claimed Gain
: The most significant QEC gain reported so far was for a single bosonic qubit in a 3D cavity, where a gain of up to a factor of two in the qubit error level was claimed.
Logical Error Rate
: The logical error rate per QEC cycle was approximately 0.002.
Overall, these attempts demonstrate the considerable challenges and current limitations in implementing QEC in practical quantum computing. While some progress has been made, the quality and reliability of logical qubits and the complexity of error correction procedures remain significant hurdles to overcome. The experiments illustrate the gap between the theoretical promise of QEC and the practical difficulties of its implementation in existing quantum computing platforms.

The scaling up engineering challenge 
Constructing a genuine quantum computer, as it has 
been envisioned, is often described using the euphemism 
���challenging���. The description above was meant to con- 
vey a more precise idea of the dif i culties involved. To the 
fundamental problems outlined above, I will now add a 
few more mundane, almost trivial, ones. 
Scaling up quantum technologies is an engineering 
problem that has its own set of exponential decays and 
other dif i culties.Once again, optimizing one parame- 
ter is done at the expense of others, often the number 
of sustainable qubits in the architecture.For instance 
frequency crowding (several qubits whose frequencies lie 
within the bandwidth of each other) leads to correlated 
crosstalks (acting on one qubit triggers unwanted dynam- 
ics on other qubits). The optimization that work for a 
handful of qubits will not work any more once the number 
of qubits has been scaled up. For instance, after increasing n, one won���t be able to spread out their frequencies anymore and cross-talk will become more problematic. 
Another (exponential) problem is the yield of the fabrication. If a qubit has a probability p to function nominally, then the probability that all ntot= n ncqubits in the chip work is pntot. The value of p must be very close to unity for this yield to be non-vanishing. Currently, it 
is rather common that several samples need to be fabri- 
cated in order for one to work correctly, so we see that 
this simple law imposes a considerable constraint on the 
reproductibility of the fabrication. This will be particularly important for solid state devices. Another crucial related problem is variability: some nominally identical 
samples may have slightly different microscopic environments that affect the qubit behavior or its coupling with 
others (such as an ill-positioned two-level system). This 
is particularly problematic if this variability is not static: 
any drift in the system will lead to a loss in precision. 
In some technologies, the mere size of the chip might be- 
come an issue. For instance superconducting transmons 
are based on resonators that currently take up a surface 
of the order of 1 mm2. Scaling up to a billion of them 
would require cooling down the surface of a one bedroom 
appartment to 10mK, which will be challenging. Besides 
the surface problem, existing dilution fridges of f er typi- 
cally 500��W of cooling power at 100mK (��� 1W is avail- 
able at 4K) for an electricity consumption of ��� 10kW. 
This is suf i cient for existing chips but would not survive 
the implementation of QEC. Another pressing problem 
is the control and addressing of all the qubits and the 
associated potential wiring/fan out bottleneck. The fan 
out problem is actually deeper than it seems. Indeed, the 
number of control lines directly controls the amount of 
calibration that is made possible to mitigate a parasitic 
coupling or simply precisely calibrate a gate. One needs 
as many knobs as there are parameters to tune.Any 
attempt to compromise there will result in poorer noise 
level.

This section discusses the significant engineering challenges associated with scaling up quantum technologies to build a practical quantum computer. The key points are:
Engineering Challenges in Scaling Up
: Scaling up quantum technologies is not just a fundamental problem but also involves a set of engineering challenges with their own complexities.
Optimization Trade-offs
: Optimizing one parameter often comes at the expense of others, particularly the number of sustainable qubits. For example, frequency crowding leads to correlated crosstalks, where acting on one qubit triggers unwanted dynamics in others.
Yield of Fabrication
: The yield, or success rate, of producing functioning qubits is critical. If each qubit has a probability

of functioning properly, then the probability that all

. This probability diminishes exponentially with the increase in the number of qubits, demanding a very high individual qubit success rate.
Variability and Reproducibility
: Variability in nominally identical samples, due to slight differences in the microscopic environment, poses a challenge. This variability, especially if it is not static, leads to precision loss.
Physical Size and Cooling Requirements
: The physical size of quantum chips, particularly for superconducting transmons, becomes a significant issue when scaling up. For instance, accommodating a billion transmons would require cooling an area equivalent to a one-bedroom apartment to extremely low temperatures, which is challenging with current technology.
Cooling Power and Energy Consumption
: Existing dilution refrigerators offer limited cooling power (around 500��W at 100mK) for a significant energy consumption (~10kW). This is sufficient for current chips but inadequate for larger-scale implementations, especially those requiring QEC.
Control and Addressing of Qubits
: Controlling and addressing a large number of qubits presents a "fan out" problem, where the complexity of wiring and signal distribution becomes a major issue. This problem is exacerbated by the need for precise calibration and mitigation of parasitic couplings, requiring numerous control lines.
In summary, the section underscores that the path to scaling up quantum computers is fraught with both fundamental and practical engineering challenges. These include issues of frequency crosstalk, fabrication yield, variability, physical size constraints, cooling requirements, and the complexities of control and calibration. Each of these factors contributes to the immense difficulty of building a quantum computer with the scale and reliability envisioned in theoretical models.

Also, it strikes me that some of the key applications 
that have been put forward for quantum computing (e.g. 
for solving chemistry problems or correlated matter) are 
slowly coming into the scope of classical methods. The 
simulation of the seminal quantum supremacy experi- 
ment, initially assumed by Google to take 10,000 years 
on the largest classical supercomputer [5], now requires 
just 6 seconds according to their own new reckoning [36] 
(an improvement of almost eleven orders of magnitude 
on the classical algorithm side). A similar fate befell the 
recent IBM quantum advantage experiment [21] which 
was simulated mere days after the article publication [37��� 
39]. Indeed, a common misconception is that the many- 
body dynamics of a quantum computer is necessarily ex- 
ponentially dif i cult to calculate on classical hardware. 
In reality it is at most exponentially hard.There are 
almost always hidden structures that scientists learn to 
exploit [4] to speed up the calculations.The number 
of problems that were apparently exponentially dif i cult 
and that were solved in polynomial time with numerical 
techniques is quickly growing. A seminal example is the 
Kondo problem, solved with the Numerical Renormal- 
ization Group (NRG) for which Wilson was attributed 
the Nobel prize. In the last few years, cornerstone mod- 
els such as the Hubbard model have started to yield to 
the convergent attack of Density Matrix Renormalization 
Group (DMRG) [40], Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) [40], 
Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo [41], Neural Network based 
variational ansatz [42], Projective Entangled Pair States 
(PEPS) [43] and more.There are also new types of 
quantum inspired algorithms that are being developped. 
For instance, the quantum Fourier transform at the core 
of Shor���s algorithm can be turned into a classical al- 
gorithm that performs Fourier transforms exponentially 
faster than the usual FFT [44]. It might very well be that 
some of the promises made for quantum computers will 
actually be kept perfectly by classical algorithms running 
on classical hardware. One could even argue that the real 
goal of physics is not to calculate this or that number but 
to unveil those hidden structures.

This section reflects on the shifting landscape of quantum computing applications, particularly in light of advancements in classical computing methods. The key points are:
Classical Methods Gaining Ground
: Some key applications initially thought to be exclusive to quantum computing, like solving complex chemistry problems or correlated matter, are increasingly becoming feasible with classical methods.
Reassessment of Quantum Supremacy Claims
: Notable quantum computing experiments, initially claimed to outperform classical computers significantly, have been reassessed.

: IBM's quantum advantage experiment was simulated on classical computers mere days after its publication, questioning the assumed exponential difficulty of simulating quantum computer dynamics on classical hardware.
Exploiting Hidden Structures in Many-Body Dynamics

Classical Techniques Solving Quantum Problems
: Examples like the Kondo problem, solved with the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG), highlight the capacity of classical methods to address problems once considered exponentially difficult. Other techniques like DMRG, Quantum Monte-Carlo, and Neural Network-based variational ansatz are showing promise in solving cornerstone models such as the Hubbard model.
Development of Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms
: New types of quantum-inspired algorithms are being developed for classical computing. For example, a classical algorithm based on the quantum Fourier transform can perform Fourier transforms exponentially faster than traditional methods.
Potential of Classical Algorithms to Fulfill Quantum Promises
: There's a growing possibility that some applications promised for quantum computing might be effectively realized by classical algorithms running on classical hardware.
Unveiling Hidden Structures as the Real Goal
: The author suggests that the true objective of physics might be to uncover hidden structures in complex problems, rather than merely calculating specific numbers, whether through quantum or classical means.
In summary, the section highlights a significant shift in the perceived advantage of quantum computing over classical methods. Advancements in classical computing, both in algorithm development and in understanding complex systems, are challenging the notion that quantum computers will be the sole solution for certain complex problems. This development suggests a more nuanced future for computing, where both quantum and classical methods have their roles and strengths.

I was interested in creating some simplified analog quantum systems. It's kind of like a monte Carlo automaton, with using yogurts with different properties to simulate grabby aliens. Each starts with a plate covered in sugar and yogurts are placed strategically to represent different alien species
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Creating a simplified analog quantum system using a Monte Carlo automaton model with yogurts to simulate different alien species is a creative and unique idea. This kind of model can serve as an educational tool to demonstrate some aspects of quantum systems, stochastic processes, or even ecological interactions, albeit in a very abstract and non-quantitative way. Here's a basic framework on how you might set this up:
Defining the System
:
Plate as the Environment
: The plate covered in sugar represents your environment or the 'universe' in which these alien species (yogurts) interact.
Yogurts as Alien Species
: Different types of yogurt can represent different alien species. The properties of these yogurts, such as thickness, color, or added ingredients, could symbolize various characteristics of the aliens, like aggression, technological advancement, or reproduction rate.
Setting Initial Conditions
:
Strategic Placement
: Place the yogurts on the plate in a pattern that represents initial conditions. This could be random or based on certain rules you define (like distance from each other, proximity to resources represented by sugar areas, etc.).
Defining Rules of Interaction
:
Growth and Spread
: Determine how yogurts 'grow' or 'spread' over time to simulate alien expansion. This could be based on the yogurt's properties (e.g., a thinner yogurt spreads faster).
Interactions Between Species
: Define what happens when different yogurts meet or overlap. Do they mix (cooperate), does one overtake the other (conflict), or do they stop spreading upon contact (neutral coexistence)?
Running the Simulation
:
Observation Over Time
: Over time (hours or days), observe how the yogurts grow and interact. You can take periodic pictures to document the changes.
Monte Carlo Aspect
: To incorporate randomness akin to a Monte Carlo method, you could introduce random elements. For example, randomly adding drops of water (or another substance) to simulate environmental changes or random events.
Analysis and Interpretation
:
Pattern Observation
: After a set period, analyze the patterns formed by the yogurts. How did the different species spread? Did some dominate over others? How did the random events affect the outcomes?
Comparison to Quantum Systems
: While this is a highly simplified and not scientifically accurate model, you can draw parallels to quantum systems in terms of probabilistic behavior, interaction outcomes, and system evolution over time.
Remember, this model is highly abstract and metaphorical. It won't provide real quantitative insights into quantum mechanics or alien civilizations but can serve as a fun and imaginative educational exercise.

I was thinking we could simulate a quantum system, by making different computers all start with the same starting conditions, so they can estimate what is happening in the other systems, attending to the ergodicity changes when deviations from the predicted template pattern are introduced
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Simulating a quantum system using multiple computers starting from the same initial conditions and then observing deviations is a fascinating approach. This method can mimic some aspects of quantum mechanics, particularly the probabilistic nature of quantum systems and how they evolve over time. Here's a basic framework for setting up such a simulation:
Initial Setup and Conditions
:
Uniform Start
: Begin with several computers (or computing instances) that have identical starting conditions. This could be a specific state in a simulation program that you've designed to represent a quantum system.
Program Specifications
: The simulation program should be capable of evolving according to predefined rules that loosely mimic quantum behaviors, such as superposition, entanglement, or probabilistic outcomes.
Introducing Ergodicity and Deviations
:
Ergodicity Concept
: Ergodicity in this context would mean that over time, the state of a single system (a single computer's simulation run) will exhibit behaviors that reflect the average of all systems (all computers) if they were observed for an infinite amount of time.
Introducing Deviations
: After a certain period, introduce small deviations or perturbations in each system. These could be random or based on certain criteria, simulating quantum fluctuations or external influences.
Parallel Simulation Runs
:
Synchronized Evolution
: Allow all systems to evolve in parallel. Each computer runs the same simulation independently but can exchange information at predefined intervals to estimate the state of other systems.
Data Collection
: Each system collects data not only about its own state but also makes predictions or estimates about the states of the other systems.
Observation and Analysis
:
Monitoring Changes
: Observe how each system evolves and how accurately it can predict the state of other systems.
Analysis of Divergence
: Pay special attention to how the systems diverge from each other over time and how accurately they can predict these divergences.
Comparisons to Quantum Mechanics
:
Probabilistic Nature
: Analyze how the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is reflected in the variations among the systems.
Ergodicity Breakdown
: Investigate how the introduction of deviations affects the ergodicity of the system. In quantum mechanics, this could parallel how measurements or external interactions collapse wavefunctions or change quantum states.
Limitations and Interpretations
:
Simplified Model
: Acknowledge that this simulation is a simplified model and cannot capture all the nuances of a real quantum system.
Educational Value
: Use the simulation as an educational tool to discuss concepts like quantum probability, state evolution, and the challenges of predicting quantum systems.
This kind of simulation project would be both educational and interesting, offering insights into the complexity of quantum systems and the challenges in simulating them, even in a simplified, abstract manner.

I mean the "computers" are the plates with yogurt and they are all reset when one yogurt takes over the whole plate
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ah, I see! Using plates with yogurt as "computers" in a simulation presents a unique, physical way to model certain aspects of a system's behavior, albeit in a highly metaphorical manner. Here's how you might structure such an experiment:
Setting Up the "Computers"
:
Plates as Simulation Platforms
: Each plate represents a separate "computer" or simulation platform.
Yogurts as Agents
: Different types of yogurt (or different colors/densities) can represent various agents or elements within the system. Their behavior (such as spreading rate) can simulate different characteristics or actions.
Uniform Starting Conditions
:
Identical Initial Setup
: Begin with the same initial conditions on each plate. This could involve placing the same amount of yogurt in the same positions on each plate.
Documenting the Starting State
: Take a photograph or make a detailed note of the initial setup for later comparison.
Running the Simulation
:
Observation Period
: Allow the yogurts to spread over time. This period can be predetermined based on how quickly the yogurt tends to spread.
Introducing Variations
: Optionally, you could introduce variations after a set time (like adding a different type of yogurt or changing the environment, e.g., tilting the plate) to see how this affects the spread.
Resetting the System
:
End Condition
: The simulation on each plate ("computer") ends (resets) when one type of yogurt dominates the entire plate.
Recording the Outcome
: Document the final state of each plate at the end condition for analysis.
Analysis and Comparison
:
Comparing Outcomes
: After multiple runs, compare the outcomes across different plates. Are there patterns or common trajectories in how the yogurt spreads?
Evaluating Predictions
: Assess if the behavior of the yogurt on one plate could be used to predict the behavior on another plate, especially before any variations are introduced.
Drawing Parallels to Quantum Systems
:
Probabilistic Behavior
: Discuss how this setup mimics probabilistic systems where outcomes are not certain but influenced by initial conditions and interactions.
System Evolution
: Note how small changes can lead to significantly different outcomes, akin to sensitivity in initial conditions in chaotic systems.
Educational Value
:
Conceptual Understanding
: Use this as a tool to discuss broader concepts like stochastic processes, system dynamics, and the challenges in predicting complex systems.
Remember, while this is a creative way to visualize certain concepts, it's a metaphorical representation and doesn't replicate the mathematical or computational rigor of actual quantum systems or simulations. It's more of an illustrative teaching aid or thought experiment than a scientific model.

Yeah maybe more inclined plates can be used to simulate star systems closer to the center of the galaxy
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Using inclined plates to simulate star systems closer to the center of the galaxy in your yogurt-based model is a creative way to introduce a form of environmental variability. In this setup, the inclination of the plates could represent the gravitational influence or other effects that might be stronger near a galactic center. Here's how you can incorporate this concept into your simulation:
Setting Up the Inclined Plates
:
Inclination to Represent Gravitational Influence
: Use various degrees of inclination for the plates. The steeper the incline, the more it could represent the intense gravitational forces or crowded conditions near the galactic center.
Consistent Initial Conditions
: Place the yogurt (representing different star systems or celestial phenomena) in similar initial positions across all plates.
Running the Simulation
:
Observation of Yogurt Spread
: Allow the yogurt to spread over time on each plate. On inclined plates, the yogurt will move differently, perhaps faster or more directly in one direction, simulating the effect of stronger gravitational forces.
Documenting the Progression
: Regularly record the state of each plate, noting how the yogurt behaves differently on inclined surfaces compared to flat ones.
Analyzing Galactic Center Effects
:
Comparison with Flat Plates
: Compare the behavior of yogurt on inclined plates with those on flat plates. The differences could symbolize how star systems or phenomena near the galactic center might behave differently compared to those in less extreme environments.
Interpreting the Movement
: Discuss how the movement and spread of yogurt on inclined plates might represent various galactic phenomena, such as faster orbital speeds or more frequent interactions between celestial bodies.
Educational Discussions
:
Galactic Dynamics
: Use this setup to initiate discussions about the dynamics of galaxies, the influence of gravitational forces near galactic centers, and how these might affect the formation and evolution of star systems.
Limitations of the Model
: It's important to note that this is a highly simplified and metaphorical representation and cannot accurately or quantitatively model galactic dynamics.
Extending the Model
:
Introducing Other Variables
: Consider introducing other elements into the model to represent additional forces or phenomena (like magnetic fields or cosmic events).
Varying the Incline and Other Conditions
: Experiment with different incline angles and perhaps other conditions like temperature or humidity to explore a range of 'galactic' environments.
This approach can provide an engaging, visual way to think about and discuss galactic phenomena, especially for educational purposes. It's a creative method to illustrate the concept that different environmental conditions can lead to different outcomes in astronomical settings.

I was also thinning that we could use detergents to simulate cosmic voids
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Incorporating detergents into your yogurt-plate model to simulate cosmic voids is an interesting idea. In astrophysics, cosmic voids are vast spaces between filaments (the largest-scale structures in the Universe), which contain very few, or no, galaxies. Detergents, which can clear areas in the yogurt, could serve as a metaphor for these vast, empty spaces. Here's how you can integrate this concept:
Preparation and Initial Setup
:
Yogurt as Star Systems
: Continue using yogurt to represent different star systems or galaxies.
Detergent as Cosmic Voids
: Choose a detergent that can interact with the yogurt to clear spaces, simulating the emptiness of cosmic voids.
Simulating Cosmic Voids
:
Applying Detergent
: Introduce small amounts of detergent to your plate at various stages of the yogurt spread. The detergent will clear areas in the yogurt, creating 'voids'.
Observation
: Watch how the yogurt behaves around these voids. Discuss how this could represent the interaction or lack thereof between galaxies and cosmic voids.
Running the Experiment
:
Multiple Scenarios
: Experiment with different timings and locations for introducing the detergent. Early introduction might represent voids that have existed for a long time, while later introduction could represent more recently formed voids.
Varying Amounts and Concentrations
: Use different amounts and concentrations of detergent to simulate various sizes and densities of cosmic voids.
Observing and Documenting
:
Pattern Formation
: Observe how the introduction of detergent affects the overall pattern of the yogurt spread. Document these patterns and their development over time.
Impact on ���Galactic��� Distribution
: Note any changes in how the yogurt spreads in response to the voids, which can lead to discussions about how cosmic voids might influence galaxy formation and distribution.
Educational Analysis
:
Discussing Cosmic Structures
: Use your observations to discuss the structure of the universe, the role of cosmic voids, and how they influence the distribution of galaxies.
Limitations of the Model
: Emphasize that this is a highly simplified model and cannot capture the complexities of actual cosmic voids and galaxy distribution.
Extending the Model
:
Introducing Other Elements
: Consider adding other elements to simulate different astrophysical phenomena, creating a more dynamic and interactive model.
This model, while simple and not scientifically accurate, can serve as an effective educational tool to visualize and discuss large-scale cosmic structures and phenomena. It provides a hands-on approach to learning and can spur interest and curiosity about the universe.

Abstract: (arXiv)
N-body simulations sample their initial conditions on an initial particle distribution, which for cosmological simulations is usually a glass or grid, whilst a Poisson distribution is used for galaxy models, spherical collapse etc. These pre-initial conditions have inherent correlations, noise due to discreteness and preferential alignments, whilst the glass distribution is poorly defined and computationally expensive to construct. We present a novel particle distribution which can be useful as a pre-initial condition for N-body simulations, using a simple construction based on a ``quaquaversal'' tiling of space. This distribution has little preferred orientation (i.e. is statistically isotropic), has a rapidly vanishing large scale power-spectrum (P(k) ~ k^4), and is trivial to create. It should be particularly useful for warm dark matter and cold collapse simulations.

The paper you've referenced, "An alternative to grids and glasses: Quaquaversal pre-initial conditions for N-body simulations" by Steen H. Hansen et al., proposes a novel approach to setting initial conditions in N-body simulations, which are crucial for studying cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. Here's a summary:
Background and Problem:
Traditional Methods
: In cosmological simulations (like those for galaxy formation or large-scale structure of the universe), initial particle distributions are commonly sampled using a grid or glass distribution for cosmological simulations, and a Poisson distribution for galaxy models or spherical collapse scenarios.
Limitations of Traditional Methods
: These methods have inherent issues such as correlations, noise due to discreteness, preferential alignments, and in the case of glass distributions, being poorly defined and computationally expensive to construct.
Proposed Solution - Quaquaversal Tiling:
Quaquaversal Tiling
: The authors present a new type of particle distribution based on a "quaquaversal" tiling of space.
Characteristics
:
Statistical Isotropy
: The distribution exhibits little preferred orientation, making it more uniform and unbiased in terms of directionality.
Rapidly Vanishing Power Spectrum
: It has a power spectrum (P(k)) that scales as
k
4
k^4
k
4
, meaning the distribution rapidly becomes smooth at larger scales.
Ease of Construction
: This distribution is straightforward and easy to create, contrasting with the computational expense of creating glass distributions.
Applications and Advantages:
Warm Dark Matter Simulations
: The quaquaversal tiling is particularly useful for simulations involving warm dark matter, which require a careful handling of initial conditions due to the nature of warm dark matter particles.
Cold Collapse Simulations
: It's also beneficial for cold collapse scenarios, where initial conditions significantly influence the collapse dynamics and final structure.
Conclusion:
The paper introduces an innovative approach to setting initial conditions in N-body simulations, addressing the limitations of traditional methods. This new method has potential benefits for a range of astrophysical simulations, particularly in areas where the uniformity and isotropy of initial conditions are critical.
This approach could provide more accurate and computationally efficient simulations, enhancing our understanding of various cosmic structures and phenomena.

I was thinking in the context of our cosmological yogurt computer
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Integrating the concept of "Quaquaversal tiling" from the N-body simulation paper into your cosmological yogurt computer model offers an intriguing way to introduce complexity and variability into your experiment. The quaquaversal tiling can inspire a method for the initial placement of yogurt on the plates, aiming to mimic the uniformity and isotropy seen in these advanced simulations. Here's how you might adapt this concept:
Adapting Quaquaversal Tiling for Yogurt Placement:
Understanding Quaquaversal Tiling
:
In N-body simulations, quaquaversal tiling is used to distribute particles (or data points) uniformly without any preferential alignment. It ensures a random yet evenly spread initial condition.
Initial Yogurt Placement
:
Use the concept to guide how you place yogurt spots on the plate. Aim for a distribution that seems random but is uniformly spread over the plate's surface. This would mimic the even distribution of matter in the early universe.
Replicating Statistical Isotropy
:
Ensure that the yogurt placements do not favor any particular direction or area of the plate, representing the isotropy of the universe.
Experiment Variations
:
You could have multiple plates with slightly different initial 'tilings' of yogurt to see how small changes in initial conditions might lead to different 'cosmic' outcomes.
Integrating Other Cosmological Concepts:
Detergent as Cosmic Voids
:
Continue using detergent to introduce voids in your yogurt universe. The interaction between the uniformly placed yogurt and the voids can mimic the cosmic dance between matter and empty space in the universe.
Inclined Plates for Gravitational Variation
:
Use inclined plates to simulate areas of the universe with stronger gravitational forces, such as near the centers of galaxies or galaxy clusters.
Documenting and Analyzing Outcomes
:
Regularly document the spread and interactions of the yogurt.
Compare the developments on different plates to discuss how initial conditions and environmental factors influence cosmic evolution.
Educational Insights:
This model can serve as a creative way to discuss concepts like the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background, the formation of cosmic structures, and the role of dark matter and dark energy (which could be represented by other elements in your experiment).
It provides a tangible way to visualize and discuss the importance of initial conditions in cosmological models.
Remember, while this experiment is metaphorical and doesn't replicate the actual physics of the universe, it can be a fun and engaging educational tool to introduce complex astrophysical concepts.

I was thinking we could use generative adversarial networks to tune our computer to get realistic looking simulations
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to refine and improve the outputs of your cosmological yogurt computer is an innovative idea. GANs could be utilized to analyze the patterns formed by the yogurt simulations, learn from them, and then generate more refined or realistic simulations of cosmic structures. Here's a possible approach:
Step 1: Data Collection from Yogurt Simulations
Conduct multiple runs of your yogurt-plate experiment, documenting the results through photographs or video at various stages of each simulation.
Ensure a diverse range of initial conditions and variations (such as different yogurt placements, plate inclinations, and times of detergent introduction) to capture a wide spectrum of possible outcomes.
Step 2: Preprocessing the Data
Digitize the collected data, converting images or videos into a format suitable for machine learning analysis.
Label the data if necessary, perhaps categorizing based on different types of cosmic phenomena they might represent.
Step 3: Training the Generative Adversarial Network
Generator Network
: This part of the GAN will learn to create images that mimic the patterns formed in the yogurt simulations.
Discriminator Network
: The discriminator will learn to differentiate between actual yogurt simulation images and the ones generated by the generator.
Train the GAN until the generator produces images that the discriminator consistently struggles to differentiate from real data.
Step 4: Generating Refined Simulations
Use the trained generator to create new, refined images of cosmic structures.
These images should ideally represent more realistic or varied cosmic phenomena, guided by the patterns learned from the yogurt simulations.
Step 5: Analysis and Comparison
Analyze the generated images to see how they compare with real astronomical observations or existing cosmological simulations.
Discuss the limitations and potential insights gained from this approach.
Step 6: Iterative Improvement
Based on comparisons and analyses, make adjustments to both the yogurt simulations and the GAN training process.
Perform additional simulations and GAN training cycles to continually refine the outputs.
Educational and Research Implications
This approach can provide unique insights into pattern formation, the influence of initial conditions, and the dynamics of cosmic structures.
It offers an educational tool to discuss the intersection of physical experiments, simulation, and machine learning.
While this method won't replicate the precision of physics-based cosmological simulations, it could uncover interesting patterns or stimulate discussion about cosmic structure formation.
Technical Considerations
Implementing GANs requires expertise in machine learning and access to suitable computational resources.
The success of this method depends on the quality and variety of the input data (yogurt simulations) and the sophistication of the GAN architecture used.
By integrating GANs with your physical yogurt simulations, you can create a unique, interdisciplinary approach to exploring and visualizing cosmic phenomena, blending physical experimentation with advanced machine learning techniques.
