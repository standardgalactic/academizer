Description
From the influential author of Dynamics in Action, how the concepts of constraints provide a way to rethink relationships, opening the way to intentional, meaningful causation.

Grounding her work in the problem of causation, Alicia Juarrero challenges previously held beliefs that only forceful impacts are causes. Constraints, she claims, bring about effects as well, and they enable the emergence of coherence. In Context Changes Everything, Juarrero shows that coherence is induced by enabling constraints, not forceful causes, and that the resulting coherence is then maintained by constitutive constraints. Constitutive constraints, in turn, become governing constraints that regulate and modulate the way coherent entities behave. Using the tools of complexity science, she offers a rigorously scientific understanding of identity, hierarchy, and top-down causation, and in so doing, presents a new way of thinking about the natural world.

Juarrero argues that personal identity, which has been thought to be conferred through internal traits (essential natures), is grounded in dynamic interdependencies that keep coherent structures whole. This challenges our ideas of identity, as well as the notion that stability means inflexible rigidity. On the contrary, stable entities are brittle and cannot persist. Complexity science, says Juarrero, can shape how we meet the world, how what emerges from our interactions finds coherence, and how humans can shape identities that are robust and resilient. This framework has significant implications for sociology, economics, political theory, business, and knowledge management, as well as psychology, religion, and theology. It points to a more expansive and synthetic philosophy about who we are and about the coherence of living and nonliving things alike

"Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence" by Alicia Juarrero is a thought-provoking book that challenges traditional notions of causation and identity. Juarrero argues that constraints, rather than forceful impacts, can bring about effects and induce coherence. She uses the tools of complexity science to present a new way of thinking about the natural world, including identity, hierarchy, and top-down causation.
The book suggests that personal identity, traditionally thought to be conferred through internal traits, is actually grounded in dynamic interdependencies that maintain coherent structures. This challenges the idea that stability equates to inflexible rigidity, arguing instead that truly stable entities are adaptable and resilient.
Juarrero's framework has wide-ranging implications for various fields, including sociology, economics, political theory, business, and knowledge management, as well as psychology, religion, and theology. It offers a more expansive and synthetic philosophy about human identity and the coherence of both living and nonliving things.
This book is recommended for readers interested in complexity science, philosophy, and the intersection of these fields with various aspects of human society and identity. It provides a fresh perspective on causation and coherence, challenging conventional wisdom and offering new insights into these fundamental concepts.

"Dynamics in Action: Intentional Behavior as a Complex System" by Alicia Juarrero is a seminal work that delves into the nature of intentional behavior and decision-making from the perspective of complexity theory. The book challenges reductionist views of human behavior and offers a fresh understanding of how actions are influenced by complex interactions within dynamic systems.
Juarrero explores how intentional behavior emerges from the interaction between the mind, body, and environment. Drawing on insights from complexity science, she argues that intentional actions cannot be reduced to simple cause-and-effect relationships or deterministic mechanisms. Instead, they arise from the complex interplay of various factors, including goals, constraints, feedback loops, and contextual dynamics.
The book emphasizes the importance of understanding behavior as a dynamic process, highlighting the nonlinear and unpredictable nature of human actions. Juarrero argues that this perspective can provide a more comprehensive understanding of human agency and decision-making, moving beyond traditional reductionistic approaches.
"Dynamics in Action" has had a significant impact on fields such as philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and complexity theory. It offers a fresh perspective on intentional behavior and challenges conventional assumptions about human action, providing a rich framework for further exploration and research in these areas.

As is often the case in philosophy, it all goes back to Aristotle. In De 
Anima and De Motu Animalium , Aristotle carefully examined the subject 
of self -motion. In the work he dedicated to his son , the Nicomachean Ethics, 
he explored the distinction between action proper and "mere behavior." A 
passage in book III of this work anticipates many of the problems that 
twentieth-century philosophy would later gather into the subdiscipline 
called "action theory ." 
Suppose a boat is threatened by an oncoming storm, Aristotle writes . 
To lighten the load and prevent capsizing, the captain throws the cargo 
overboard . Is his behavior voluntary , involuntary , or compulsory ? The 
difference between voluntary , involuntary , and compulsory behavior , 
Aristotle insists, depends on whether or not the "origin" or "principle 
of movement " (arche) is within the agent. Behavior is compulsory when 
the "cause is in the external circumstances and the agent contributes 
nothing " (EN 1110b). Moving because I was pushed, that is, is "compulsory 
." Easy enough, and in contemporary action theory such reactions are 
classified alongside blinks and do not qualify as action. What about involuntary 
behavior ? Can you wink involuntarily ? As jurors soon discover to 
their dismay, many subtle gradations exist between the extremes of voluntary 
intentional action and compulsory behavior -between a wink and 
a blink . 
Throwing the cargo overboard , for example, is "mixed," Aristotle 
states. On the one hand it is like involuntary behavior -behavior whose 
principle of movement is within the agent, and so qualifies as action-but 
with a qualification . It is "painful ." Under ordinary circumstances no one 
would choose to throw valuable goods overboard . "} didn 't want to do it, 
but I did. I had to." On the other hand, throwing the cargo overboard is 
"more like [a voluntary act], for the behavior was worthy of choice at 
the time when [it was] done and the end of the action [was] relative to the 
occasion" (EN 1110all- 13). It was the desire not to capsize that caused 
the captain to throw the cargo overboard ; nobody physically pushed him. 
Voluntary actions are thus both purposive and appropriate to the situation 
. Appropriate behavior whose principle of movement or cause is 
within the agent, who is aware of what he or she is doing , is paradigmatically 
"action." 
Aristotle distinguish es those situations in which the cause of a person's 
behavior is ignorance, which he calls acting by reason of ignorance , from 
those in which someone who is drunk or in a rage acts in ignorance (the 
cause here is the liquor or the anger, not the ignorance). The former are 
not voluntary , because the agent did not know what he was doing , but 
also not involuntary , because he did not regret his behavior . Perhaps the 
latter should have a name of its own , Aristotle muses. In any case , when 
the cause is ignorance, the behavior cannot be classified as voluntary . And 
yet when compared to the role of either the hammer in the patella reflex, 
or of the lightbulb 's flash that makes us blink , ignorance is internal . But 
how can a lack of something (awareness, in this case ) be causally effica- 
cious? What kind of causality would be at work ? Aristotle does not 
address that issue, but it is possible to infer from what he does say that, 
despite lack of regret, ignorance of "the circumstances of the action and 
the objects with which it is concerned" makes the behavior that issues

In Aristotle's works, particularly "De Anima," "De Motu Animalium," and "Nicomachean Ethics," he explores the concept of self-motion and distinguishes between voluntary, involuntary, and compulsory behavior. He presents a scenario of a captain throwing cargo overboard to lighten the load and prevent a boat from capsizing. Aristotle argues that the classification of behavior depends on whether the principle of movement or origin is within the agent.
Compulsory behavior, according to Aristotle, occurs when the cause of movement is external, and the agent contributes nothing. This can be seen when someone is pushed, and their movement is not voluntary. Involuntary behavior, on the other hand, occurs when the principle of movement is within the agent, but there are factors that limit their freedom of choice. Aristotle introduces the idea of "mixed" behavior, where the action is both involuntary and voluntary in certain respects. For example, throwing cargo overboard can be seen as a mixed behavior because the principle of movement is within the agent, but it may be done out of necessity and not by choice.
Aristotle also distinguishes actions performed due to ignorance from those influenced by factors like being drunk or in a rage. Actions resulting from ignorance are not classified as voluntary because the agent did not know what they were doing. However, if there is no regret for the behavior, it is also not considered involuntary. Aristotle raises questions about the causality of ignorance and its role in behavior.
While Aristotle does not address the issue of how the lack of awareness can be causally effective, his writings suggest that ignorance of circumstances and objects involved in an action can influence behavior even without regret. This raises questions about the nature of causality in relation to awareness and the role of ignorance in human actions.
Aristotle's exploration of self-motion and behavior laid the groundwork for later discussions in action theory, which became a subdiscipline of twentieth-century philosophy. His examination of voluntary, involuntary, and mixed behaviors, as well as the influence of ignorance, provides a foundation for understanding the complexities of human action and decision-making.

openness, nonlinearity , time, and context come to the forefront . Although 
centrally concerned with the conceptual problems of action, therefore, this 
book threads not only through other branch es of philosophy , but through 
the history of Western science as well . Like the hermeneutical model for 
explaining action, an interdisciplinary approach such as the one I am 
attempting must also, of necessity, tack back and forth between the history 
of philosophy and science on the one hand, and action theory on the 
other, in order to bring their relationship into view . 
Interdisciplinary books are notoriously problematic : sections that appear 
overly simplistic and old hat to one audience strike another as brand new 
and difficult . In this book in particular , the history and science sections 
(chapters 1, 3, 7, and 8) are unavoidably sweeping and impressionistic , 
whereas those that present a sort of lawyer 's brief against contemporary 
action theory (chapters 2, 4, and 5) are detailed and technical. Readers 
familiar with the literature of action theory might do well to bracket 
these chapters. Readers who know general systems theory and nonlinear 
dynamics can bracket chapters 7 and 8. 
Chapters 9 through 13 make up the theoretical heart of the book . Using 
the dynamics of complex adaptive systems as a theory -constitutive metaphor 
, chapter 9 develops a new way of thinking of causality as constraint . 
In chapters 10 and 11 I show how thinking of self-organized neurological 
systems as dynamical landscapes makes the heretofore recalcitrant problem 
of meaning tractable. In those chapters I claim that meaningful intentions 
are embodied in self-organized neurological dynamics, and that act 
types are attractors through those brain dynamics. Evidence from biological 
and developmental research shows that this is a plausible scenario. 
Chapters 12 and 13 apply these ideas specifically to the problem of action. 
Doing so either solves or circumvents each of the problems on which 
traditional theories of action have floundered . Chapter 12 shows that 
complex adaptive systems theory allows us to conceptualize how the 
meaningful content of intentions , as embodied in dynamical organization , 
can cascade across coordinates and terminate in behavior that semantically 
satisfies the intention from which it issued. Chapter 13 shows how 
the emphasis that dynamical systems theory places on contextual em- 
beddedness can resolve many of the problems with which action theory 
has traditionally grappled . 
In part III I leave the metaphysics of action and turn to the subject of 
explanation . Chapter 14 sketch es the narrative and historical model 
of explaining action mentioned earlier. The chapter with which I end, 
"Agency and Freedom," address es some of the implications that a 
dynamical systems and narrative approach to action and its explanation 
might have for such disparate subject areas as law, psychology , and 
education

The book acknowledges that interdisciplinary works can present challenges, as different sections may vary in familiarity and difficulty for different audiences. The history and science sections provide a broad overview and are more impressionistic, while the chapters critiquing contemporary action theory are detailed and technical. Readers familiar with action theory can choose to focus on the relevant chapters, while those knowledgeable about general systems theory and nonlinear dynamics can skip chapters 7 and 8.
Chapters 9 to 13 form the theoretical core of the book. In Chapter 9, the author develops a new conceptualization of causality as constraint, drawing on the dynamics of complex adaptive systems. Chapters 10 and 11 explore how thinking of self-organized neurological systems as dynamical landscapes can provide insights into the problem of meaning, arguing that meaningful intentions are embodied in neurological dynamics. Evidence from biological and developmental research supports this perspective.
Chapters 12 and 13 apply these ideas to the problem of action. They address how complex adaptive systems theory can explain how the meaningful content of intentions, embodied in dynamical organization, can lead to behavior that satisfies the intended meaning. The emphasis on contextual embeddedness in dynamical systems theory also helps resolve traditional problems in action theory.
Part III shifts the focus to the subject of explanation. Chapter 14 presents a narrative and historical model of explaining action, and the final chapter, "Agency and Freedom," explores the implications of a dynamical systems and narrative approach to action and its explanation in areas such as law, psychology, and education.
In summary, the book engages with concepts of openness, nonlinearity, time, and context in relation to action. It takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on philosophy, science, and action theory, and offers new perspectives on causality, meaning, and explanation in the context of complex adaptive systems.

What is the difference between a wink and a blink ? Knowing one from the 
other is important-and not only for philosophers of mind. Significant 
moral and legal consequences rest on the distinction between voluntary 
and involuntary behavior. Jurors , for example , report that deciding 
whether the accused caused someone's death is relatively easy. They find 
it much more difficult , on the other hand , to determine "what class of 
offense -if any-had been committed" (Hacker 1995, 44). At Supreme 
Court hearings on the subject of physician-assisted suicide , the discussion 
turned on the same issue . Suppose a doctor administers a large dose of 
barbiturates to a patient in pain. The patient slips into a coma and dies. 
Was it first- or second -degree murder, or accidental homicide ? Walter 
Dellinger, acting Solicitor General , testified at those hearings that "so 
long as the physician 's intent was to relieve pain and not cause death ," the 
behavior was not unlawful . As Anthony Lewis, writing in the New York 
Times (January 1997), noted of the debate , "Everything turned on the 
shadowy question of intent ." 
Our judgments concerning moral responsibility and legal liability will 
be very different, therefore , depending on how we answer the question , 
"Was it a wink or a blink?" And yet that is precisely the problem: gauging 
intent in order to establish what the accused did so that jurors as well as 
the rest of us can then discriminate among degrees of responsibility. We 
are not responsible and cannot be held accountable for blinking. And 
rightly so. We think of blinks, unlike winks, as behavior that we do 
not intend and cannot control-something that "happens to us," a reflex 
reaction in which we are passive . Winking, on the other hand, is something 
we "do" (in some unclear sense of "we" that identifies us as agents ). 
Only intentional behavior qualifies as moral or immoral; reflex es are 
amoral. But what marks off intentional actions from unintentional, accidental 
or reflex behavior? How do agents (as opposed to their bodies ?) do 
things? And how do we tell? 
The branch of philosophy called "action theory" has traditionally been 
charged with articulating necessary and sufficient conditions marking the 
Introduction 
boundary between action and nonaction , as well as between voluntary 
and involuntary behavior . The philosophical issues with which action 
theory is concerned include such topics as the concepts of agency and free 
will , the relationship between awareness and behavior , and the role that 
reasons play in causing and explaining actions. Understanding these has 
required weaving together topics culled from such disparate disciplines as 
epistemology , metaphysics, philosophy of mind and, more recently , neurology 
and even genetics.

The distinction between a wink and a blink is important not only for philosophers of mind but also for significant moral and legal implications. Jurors, for example, find it easier to determine whether the accused caused someone's death but struggle with determining the class of offense committed. The intent behind an action becomes crucial in assessing moral responsibility and legal liability.
In the context of debates on physician-assisted suicide, the intent of the doctor administering medication to relieve pain versus causing death becomes pivotal in determining the legality of the action. Intent, in these cases, can shape judgments concerning degrees of responsibility and liability.
The challenge lies in gauging intent to establish the nature of the behavior—whether it was a wink or a blink. Differentiating between intentional and unintentional behavior is crucial as only intentional actions qualify as morally or legally accountable. Blinks are seen as reflexes, something that happens to us and over which we have no control, while winking is considered an intentional action.
Action theory, a branch of philosophy, is concerned with articulating the necessary and sufficient conditions that distinguish action from non-action and voluntary from involuntary behavior. It addresses topics such as agency, free will, the relationship between awareness and behavior, and the role of reasons in causing and explaining actions. Exploring these topics requires interdisciplinary engagement with fields such as epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and even neurology and genetics in recent years.
In summary, understanding the difference between a wink and a blink goes beyond philosophical inquiry, impacting moral judgments and legal determinations. Action theory seeks to delineate the boundaries between action and non-action, as well as voluntary and involuntary behavior, drawing on various disciplines to explore questions of agency, awareness, and the role of reasons in human actions.

Although not labeled as such until after World War II, the concerns of 
action theory go as far back as the ancient Greeks. In Plato's dialogue 
Phaedo , which takes place while Socrates is awaiting execution , Socrates 
worries that earlier philosophers made air, ether, and water the only 
causes . What about Socrates's reasons for not escaping from prison? Are 
they not the true cause of his behavior ? Later, and more systematically , 
Aristotle examined the difference between intentional and involuntary 
behavior . An adequate explanation of anything , he claimed, must identify 
those causes responsible for the phenomenon being explained. Aristotle 's 
four causes are final cause (the goal or purpose toward which something 
aims), formal cause (that which makes anything that sort of thing and no 
other I), material cause (the stuff out of which it is made), and efficient 
cause (the force that brings the thing into being). Explaining anything , 
including behavior , requires identifying the role that each cause plays in 
bringing about the phenomenon . Implicit in Aristotle 's account of cause 
and crucially influential in the history of action theory , however , is another 
of Aristotle 's claims: that nothing , strictly speaking, can move, cause, or 
act on itself in the same respect. This principle has remained unchallenged 
throughout the history of philosophy and, as we shall see, has caused 
many problems for the theory of action. 
Because he had more than one type of cause to draw on, Aristotle was 
able to explain voluntary self-motion in terms of a peculiar combination 
of causes. By the end of the seventeenth century , however , modern phi- 
losophy had discarded two of those causes , final and formal . As a result, 
purposive , goal-seeking and formal , structuring causes no longer even 
qualified as causal; philosophy restricted its understanding of causality to 
efficient cause. And then, taking its cue from Newtonian science, modern 
philosophy conceptualized efficient causality as the push-pull impact of 
external forces on inert matter . This mechanistic understanding of cause , 
too, has had serious consequences for action theory , particularly when 
combined with the principle philosophy did retain: Aristotle 's thesis that 
nothing moves itself. 
Aristotle had insisted that formal deduction from universal premises is 
the logic of reasoning proper to science (episfeme ). Because human behavior 
is temporally and contextually embedded, on the other hand, it is 
Introduction2 
the central concern of practical wisdom (phronesis ). Because of its subject 
matter and unlike deduction , therefore, wisdom varies ''as the occasion 
requires." In contrast, modern philosophy also brought with it a particular 
understanding of the logic of explanation : the principle that (ideally ) all 
explanation is fundamentally deductive in form . Following Hume and in 
opposition to Aristotle , as Stephen T oulmin (1990) has pointed out, philosophers 
concluded that deduction from timeless and contextless laws is 
the ideal, not only of science, but of any legitimate form of reasoning. A 
law of nature-at worst statistical, but ideally strictly deterministic- 
combined with statements specifying initial conditions must allow that 
which is being explained (the explanandum ) to be inferred . Even human 
actions must be explained in that manner. By the middle of the twentieth 
century , the principle that the logic of any serious explanation must adhere 
to such a "covering -law model" was the received view .

The concerns of action theory can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, although the term itself was not used until after World War II. In Plato's dialogue "Phaedo," Socrates raises the question of whether earlier philosophers adequately addressed the causes of behavior, particularly the role of reasons. Aristotle further examined the distinction between intentional and involuntary behavior, emphasizing the importance of identifying the causes responsible for a phenomenon.
Aristotle's explanation of voluntary self-motion relied on a combination of causes, including final cause (the goal or purpose), formal cause (the defining characteristics), material cause (the substance), and efficient cause (the force that brings it into being). However, by the end of the seventeenth century, modern philosophy had discarded final and formal causes, narrowing the understanding of causality to efficient cause. This shift, influenced by Newtonian science, conceptualized causality as external forces acting upon inert matter, neglecting the self-movement of entities.
Aristotle also recognized the importance of practical wisdom (phronesis) in understanding human behavior, which is temporally and contextually embedded. Modern philosophy, however, introduced an understanding of explanation based on deductive logic, considering deduction from timeless and contextless laws as the ideal form of reasoning. According to this view, all explanations, including human actions, should adhere to a "covering-law model," where a law of nature and initial conditions logically entail the phenomenon being explained.
This approach, influenced by philosophers like Hume, departed from Aristotle's understanding of practical wisdom and the contextual nature of human behavior. By the middle of the twentieth century, the covering-law model became the prevailing view regarding the logic of explanation.
The historical development of philosophy and its changing notions of causality and explanation have significant implications for action theory. The rejection of certain causes, the mechanistic understanding of causality, and the preference for deductive explanations have shaped the challenges and debates within the field of action theory.

Understanding all cause as collision -like, and the explanatory ideal as 
deduction from deterministic laws, are two examples of a trend that has 
characterized the history of philosophy for over two thousand years: the 
progressive elimination of time and context from metaphysics and epis- 
temology . Since time and context playa central role in all living things, 
including human beings and their behavior , action theory is thus an excellent 
prism that refracts and separates two key problems in the history 
of Western philosophy -cause and explanation -and lays bare the role 
that time and context play in each. The first claim of this book is that an 
inadequate, 350-year-old model of cause and explanation underlies contemporary 
theories of action. 
In addition to a brief history of the concepts of cause and explanation , 
Part I consists of a detailed analysis of the major warhorses of contemporary 
action theory with a view to demonstrating that action theory rests 
on these two mistaken views of cause and explanation . Chapters 1 and 2 
examine the modern understanding of cause and the problems it has 
occasioned for action theory . In those chapters I survey major contemporary 
causal theories of action, all of which have consistently adhered to 
Aristotle 's principle that nothing moves or changes itself; intentions , volitions 
, and other alleged causes of action are supposed to be other than the 
behavior they cause. In addition , by subscribing to a Newtonian understanding 
of efficient cause as well , these theories have also uncritically 
assumed that intentions , volitions , or agents cause action in the collisionlike 
way that cue sticks cause cue balls to move. As a result of these two 
unexamined presuppositions , causal theories have been plagued by characteristic 
and recurrent objections . Most of the action theory literature of 
the past four decades has consisted of repeated attempts to mitigate or 
circumvent these objections , not recognizing that they will persist until 
action theory abandons this mechanistic view of cause.

Next, I examine the problems that the received view of explanation has 
created for action theory. Chapter 3 surveys the history of the covering- 
law approach to rationality and explanation. Chapter 4 examines how this 
explanatory framework, in the guise of logical behaviorism , makes an 
appearance in the theory of action. Behaviorist analyses have tried to 
reduce the flexibility and appropriateness characteristic of human action 
to stimulus-response patterns. Motivating such attempted reductions has 
been the desire to make human behavior explicable by rendering it scientific 
, that is, tractable by the received view of explanation as deduction. 
Given modern philosophy's elimination of final cause from its metaphysical 
framework, even those theorists who recognized the obvious goal- 
directedness of action tried to do the same . Teleology, too, therefore , was 
analyzed away as nothing but the lawful regularity of stimulus -response 
patterns. Chapter 5 chronicles the attempted reduction of purposiveness 
to behaviorist patterns of stimulus-response. 
Modern philosophy's understanding of cause and explanation has failed 
as a general theory. Today there is no reason to continue to subscribe to 
this atemporal and acontextual approach . By the nineteenth century, two 
major challenges to the modern conceptual framework had already 
appeared . First, the inexorable increase in entropy postulated by the second 
law of thermodynamics seemed to return temporal direction to physics 
by identifying a universal and irreversible arrow of time: everything 
moves from order to disorder. On the face of it, however, biology

Throughout the history of philosophy, there has been a tendency to eliminate time and context from metaphysics and epistemology. However, time and context play a crucial role in understanding living things, including human behavior. Action theory serves as a prism that highlights this issue and separates two key problems in philosophy: cause and explanation. The book argues that contemporary theories of action are based on an inadequate model of cause and explanation that has persisted for 350 years.
Part I of the book provides a detailed analysis of contemporary action theory, demonstrating how it rests on mistaken views of cause and explanation. Chapters 1 and 2 examine the modern understanding of cause and its problems for action theory. These theories, influenced by Newtonian physics, have followed Aristotle's principle that nothing moves or changes itself. They also assume a mechanistic view of efficient cause, where intentions or volitions are seen as causing action in a collision-like manner. These presuppositions have led to recurring objections in causal theories of action.
The book further explores the problems arising from the received view of explanation. Chapter 3 surveys the history of the covering-law approach to rationality and explanation, while Chapter 4 examines how this approach appears in the theory of action, particularly in the form of logical behaviorism. Behaviorist analyses have attempted to reduce the complexity and appropriateness of human action to stimulus-response patterns in the pursuit of rendering it scientifically tractable.
The elimination of final cause from modern metaphysics has also led to the reduction of teleology and purposiveness to behaviorist patterns of stimulus-response, as discussed in Chapter 5. However, the book argues that this atemporal and acontextual approach has failed as a general theory.
By the nineteenth century, challenges to this modern conceptual framework had emerged. The second law of thermodynamics, which posits an increase in entropy, reintroduced temporal directionality in physics by identifying a universal and irreversible arrow of time. Biology, on the other hand, seemed to challenge this notion, as living systems exhibit organization and goal-directed behavior. These challenges call for a reevaluation of the atemporal and acontextual approach in philosophy.
In summary, the book argues for a departure from the mechanistic views of cause and explanation that have dominated contemporary action theory. It emphasizes the importance of reintroducing time and context into philosophical analyses and suggests that a more nuanced understanding of causality and explanation is needed to fully grasp the complexities of human action.

system not only determine which parts will be allowed into the system: 
the global dynamics also regulate and constrain the behavior of the lower- 
level components . The theory of complex adaptive systems can therefore 
be used as a metaphor for this form of causal relations , which had puzzled 
Kant as a form of causality "unknown to us." 
In other words, far from being the inert epiphenomenon modern 
science claims all wholes are , complex dynamical wholes clearly-and 
in a distributed manner-exert active power on their parts such that the 
overall system is maintained and enhanced . Understanding dynamical 
systems can therefore revive Aristotle 's concepts of formal and final cause 
by offering a scientifically respectable model of how such causes cause . 
Chapter 7 introduces the reader to systems theory in general ; chapter 8 
provides an overview of nonlinear dynamical systems theory. 
Since the active power that wholes exert on their components is clearly 
not the go -cart -like collisions of a mechanical universe, how are we to 
explicate these interlevel causal relationships previously "unknown to us"? 
The third main claim of this book is that the causal mechanism at work 
between levels of hierarchical organization can best be understood as the 
operations of constraint. Chapters 9 and 10 analyze interlevel causes in 
terms of constraints. 
Lila Gatlin (1972) distinguish es between two types of constraints : 
context -free constraints , which take a system 's components far from equiprobability 
, and context -sensitive constraints , which synchronize and correlate 
previously independent parts into a systemic whole. When organized 
into a complex, integral whole, parts become correlated as a function of 
context-dependent constraints imposed on them by the newly organized 
system in which they are now embedded . Catalysts , feedback loops, 
and biological resonance and entrainment embody context-sensitive 
constraints. 
From the bottom up, the establishment of context -sensitive constraints 
is the phase change that self-organizes the global level. Or to say it differently 
, the self-organization of the global level is the appearance of 
context -sensitive constraints on the system's components . Parts heretofore 
separate and independent are suddenly correlated, thereby becoming in- 
terdependent components or nodes of a system . But even as they regulate 
alternatives , context-dependent constraints simultaneously open up new 
possibilities. The more complex a system , the more states and properties 
it can manifest : novel characteristics and laws emerge with the organization 
of the higher level. For example , when amino acids self-organize 
(bottom -up) into a protein , the protein can carry out enzymatic functions 
that the amino acids on their own cannot. From the top down and serving 
as a contextual constraint, the dynamics of the global dynamical system in 
turn close off some of the behavioral alternatives that would be open to 
the components were they not captured in the overall system. Once 
folded up into a protein , for example, the amino acids find their activity 
regulated (top-down ); they behave differently as part of the protein than 
they would have on their own . 
Constraints work , then, by modifying either

Complex dynamical systems exhibit active power, with the overall system exerting influence on its individual components. This challenges the notion of wholes as inert epiphenomena. The theory of complex adaptive systems offers a scientifically respectable model that revives Aristotle's concepts of formal and final cause. Systems theory and nonlinear dynamical systems theory are introduced in Chapters 7 and 8, respectively.
The causal relationships between levels of hierarchical organization in complex systems can be best understood as operations of constraint. Constraints can be categorized as context-free or context-sensitive. Context-free constraints lead to non-equiprobability among system components, while context-sensitive constraints synchronize and correlate previously independent parts into a systemic whole. Catalysts, feedback loops, resonance, and entrainment are examples of context-sensitive constraints.
The establishment of context-sensitive constraints marks a phase change that self-organizes the global level of a system. As a result, previously separate and independent components become correlated and interdependent. Context-dependent constraints regulate alternatives and open up new possibilities. Complex systems can manifest a wide range of states and properties, with novel characteristics and laws emerging at higher levels of organization.
From a top-down perspective, the dynamics of the global system impose contextual constraints on the components, closing off some behavioral alternatives that would be available if they were not part of the overall system. For example, when amino acids self-organize into a protein, the protein can carry out enzymatic functions that the individual amino acids cannot perform independently.
Constraints modify the behavior of components, either by enabling or restricting certain actions. They play a crucial role in the coherence and regulation of complex systems, shaping the interactions between levels of organization and allowing for the emergence of higher-level properties and behaviors.

Constraints work , then, by modifying either a system's phase space or 
the probability distribution of events and movements within that space. 
Since actions are lower , motor -level implementations of higher -level intentional 
causes , reconceptualizing mental causation in terms of top-down , 
context -sensitive dynamical constraints can radically recast our thinking 
about action. 
There is ample evidence that the human brain is a self-organized , complex 
adaptive system that encodes stimuli with context -sensitive constraints 
. Studies showing that "each cortical pattern is a dissipative 
structure emergent from a microscopic fluctuation " suggest that this is a 
plausible hypothesis (Freeman 1995, 51). Not only does the brain have 
reentrant pathways (Edelman 1987) that function as positive feedback 
channels; it is also known to determine for itself what counts as a mean- 
ingful stimulus and what constitutes meaningless noise. Research increas- 
ingly supports the hypothesis that nonlinear feedback and resonance and 
entrainment among neurons-as well as between the overall nervous 
system and the environment -are responsible for the self-organization of 
coherent behavior in neuronal populations . 
In Chapters 11 through 13 I examine the implications of such a view 
for a dynamical account of action. As is true of all self-organized structures 
, the emergent dynamics of coherent neurological activity can be 
expected to show novel and surprising properties : as a consequence of the 
neurological self-organization resulting from context -sensitive constraints , 
I suppose, conscious-and particularly self-conscious-beings emerge, 
beings that can believe, intend , mean, and so forth . Since the global level 
of all complex adaptive systems contextually constrains the behavior 
of the components that make it up, I postulate that behavior constitutes 
action (a wink , as opposed to a blink ) when the brain's self-organized 
dynamics, as characterized by consciousness and meaning, originate , regulate 
, and constrain skeleto-muscular process es such that the resulting 
behavior "satisfies the meaningful content " embodied in the complex 
dynamics from which it issued. 
Thinking of agents and their actions in this manner provides a previously 
unavailable way of conceptualizing the difference in the etiology 
and trajectory of winks and blinks . Bottom -up, formulating a prior intention 
to wink would be the felt counterpart of a neurological phase change, 
the dynamical self-organization of a more complex level of coherent brain 
activity that integrates neuronal patterns embodying wants, desires, meaning 
, and the like. Unlike Newtonian causes , however , this higher level of

neurological organization would not be simply a triggering device. The

Constraints, in the context of complex adaptive systems and their influence on action, work by modifying either the phase space of a system or the probability distribution of events and movements within that space. Actions, seen as lower-level implementations of higher-level intentional causes, can be reconceptualized in terms of top-down, context-sensitive dynamical constraints. This perspective radically reshapes our understanding of action.
There is evidence supporting the view that the human brain is a self-organized, complex adaptive system that encodes stimuli with context-sensitive constraints. The brain exhibits reentrant pathways and has the ability to determine meaningful stimuli from meaningless noise. Nonlinear feedback, resonance, and entrainment among neurons, as well as interactions between the nervous system and the environment, contribute to the self-organization of coherent behavior in neuronal populations.
Chapters 11 to 13 delve into the implications of this view for a dynamical account of action. Self-organized structures, including the brain, display novel and surprising properties as a result of context-sensitive constraints. Consciousness and meaning emerge from the self-organization of coherent neurological activity. The book postulates that behavior constitutes action (such as a wink rather than a blink) when the brain's self-organized dynamics, characterized by consciousness and meaning, originate, regulate, and constrain skeletal-muscular processes in a way that aligns with the meaningful content embodied in the complex dynamics from which it arises.
This perspective provides a new way to conceptualize the difference between the etiology and trajectory of winks and blinks. Formulating a prior intention to wink corresponds to a neurological phase change—a self-organization of a more complex level of coherent brain activity that integrates patterns embodying wants, desires, and meaning. Unlike Newtonian causes, this higher level of neurological organization is not merely a triggering device. The global dynamics of self-organizing complex adaptive processes constrain their components (in the case of behavior, motor processes) from a top-down perspective. However, these dynamics are not occurrent events like Newtonian forces. An intention's constraints are embodied in the metastable dynamics characterizing its neurophysiological organization and do not immediately disengage.

Based on the available information provided, it is difficult to ascertain the specific connections between the book and Prigogine's dissipative structures, Pearl's Markov blankets, and free energy minimization in general. However, it is possible to speculate on potential relationships:
Prigogine's Dissipative Structures: Prigogine's work on dissipative structures in non-equilibrium thermodynamics explores the emergence of order and complexity in far-from-equilibrium systems. The chapter titled "Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics" in the book might draw upon concepts from Prigogine's theory to discuss the dynamics and self-organization of complex systems, including human action.
Pearl's Markov Blankets: Pearl's concept of Markov blankets, which relates to causal inference in probabilistic graphical models, might be discussed in the context of understanding the causal relationships and constraints that shape human action. The chapter on causal theories of action or constraints as causes could potentially touch upon the relevance of Markov blankets in understanding the causal structure of action.
Free Energy Minimization: Free energy minimization is a principle derived from the field of statistical physics and is often applied to understand the behavior and dynamics of complex systems. The book might explore how the principle of free energy minimization relates to action and behavior, particularly in terms of how organisms or agents seek to minimize uncertainty or maximize the agreement between their internal models and the external environment.
However, without access to the specific content and arguments presented in the book, it is challenging to provide a definitive analysis of the author's perspectives on these topics. To gain a deeper understanding of the book's connections to Prigogine's dissipative structures, Pearl's Markov blankets, and free energy minimization, it would be necessary to consult the book directly or obtain additional information about its content.

Recapitulation 
The last two chapters introduced an alternative to a Newtonian model of 
cause. In those chapters I showed how according to nonlinear , far-from- 
equilibrium science (and without appealing to any mysterious elan vital ), 
systems are created from interacting components , which they then, in 
turn, control . As a result of this strange loop relationship between parts 
and wholes, these dynamical systems are not mere epiphenomena; they 
actively exercise causal power over their components . Still missing, however 
, is an analysis of the way this causal influence works . Simply calling 
it a phenomenon akin to Aristotle 's formal and final causes , or Kant's unknown 
causality, does not take us very far. How can we analyze the type 
of cause at work in dynamic interlevel relationships , both bottom -up and 
top-down ? Specifically, the problem boils down to the following : how can 
we both supersede Aristotle 's prohibition against self-cause and at the 
same time go beyond modern science's limited , mechanistic understanding 
of cause as billiard ball- like? In this chapter I offer an analysis of the 
interlevel causality of dynamical systems-as the workings of constraint . 
Doing so will give us a handle on top-down causality, in particular , on 
how intentions can cause and flow into behavior : how they can inform its 
trajectory , in other words .

Distributed Control 
Dissipative structures are not mechanical process es; in autocatalysis no 
one molecule pushes the others around. Neither does anyone of the 
brain's neurons. The central nervous system has no localized grandmother 
control unit that, in the manner of a Newtonian force, activates others by 
bumping into them. We saw that as structures of process es, autocatalytic 
webs are distributed patterns of dynamic relations . They are relational and 
property , not concrete systems. It is therefore a category mistake to think 
of them as exercising causal power by impressing a force on their components 
. And yet far from being inert epiphenomena, as traditional science 
132 Chapter 9 
and philosophy would have it, complex systems like macroscopic Benard 
cells, as distributed wholes, do indeed affect their components . 
How are we to conceptualize this distributed control that complex systems 
exercise, top-down , on their components ? I propose that we analyze 
those causal relations as the operations of constraint . Doing so allows 
interlevel relationships , previously intractable , to be incorporated into a 
more comprehensive understanding of cause, while simultaneously con- 
ferring onto logical status on the level of the distributed whole . Once 
barriers against self-cause are broken down , there can be no objection to 
having wholes act on parts.

describe the way the motion of a simple pendulum or a particle on an 
inclined plane is "compel led by the " t;r ,eometry of its environment to move on 
some specified curve or surface" (Lindsay 1961, 239, emphasis mine). To 
explain oscillations , Lindsay notes that "some of the most important cases 
of constrained motion are those in which particles are connected by rods 
and strings" and cannot, therefore, move any which way . In his explanation

Chapter 9, titled "Constraints as Causes: The Intersection of Information Theory and Complex Systems Dynamics," focuses on the analysis of interlevel causality within dynamical systems. Here's a recap of the chapter's main points:
Introduction: The chapter begins by highlighting the need for an alternative to the Newtonian model of cause and understanding the causal influence of complex systems on their components.
Distributed Control: It discusses how dissipative structures, such as autocatalytic webs and the brain's neurons, exercise causal power over their components. These systems are not mechanical, and their control is not based on localized forces.
Conceptualizing Distributed Control: The chapter proposes analyzing the causal relations between complex systems and their components as the operations of constraint. Constraints allow for interlevel relationships and distributed control to be incorporated into the understanding of cause.
Constraints: The concept of constraint is introduced, initially used in physical mechanics to describe how the motion of particles is compelled by the geometry of their environment. Constraints limit the possible movements and behaviors of system components.
Constraint as Cause: The chapter argues that constraints can function as causes within complex systems dynamics. Constraints imposed by the system shape and determine the behavior and interactions of its components.
Breaking Barriers: By conceptualizing distributed control as constraint, the chapter challenges Aristotle's prohibition against self-cause and allows for wholes to act on parts. This expands our understanding of causality beyond the limited mechanistic view of cause.
Overall, the chapter explores the role of constraints in complex systems dynamics and their potential as causes. It provides a framework for understanding top-down causality and how intentions can inform and influence behavior within the context of dynamic interlevel relationships.

of constrained motion are those in which particles are connected by rods

of 0 ' Alembert 's principle , Lindsay states, "If the masses were subject 
to no constraints (i.e., if they were not connected in any way or forced 
[a synonym for compel led?] to move along certain curves or surfaces) .. ." 
(251). And in his discussion of Gauss's principle of least constraint , Lindsay 
says, "The system being subjected to certain constraints (i.e., the masses 
being perhaps connected to each other by rods or cords, or constrained to 
move along certain curves or surfaces) .. ." (254). In physical mechanics, 
that is, constraints are said to "compel" and "force" behavior . The term 
suggests, however , not an external force that pushes, but a thing 's connection 
to something else by rods, cords, strings, and the like as well as to the 
setting in which the object is situated. What do both have in common? 
The first point to be made, in opposition to Newtonian science and 
modern philosophy 's dismissal of relational properties as subjective, is that 
by "constraints " Lindsay clearly means something other than Newtonian 
forces that is nevertheless causal. As features either of an object's connections 
with the environment or of its embeddedness in that environment ,

one hand and the knee joint on the other systematically constrains the

In the given excerpt, the discussion focuses on the concept of constraints in physical mechanics and their role in shaping behavior. Here's an explanation of the main points:
Lindsay's Definition of Constraints: Lindsay describes constraints in physical mechanics as connections between objects through rods, cords, strings, or their interaction with the environment. Constraints compel behavior by limiting the possible movements and forcing the object to follow specific curves or surfaces.
Constraints as Relational Properties: Constraints are not external forces that push objects but rather the connections and embeddedness of objects in their environment. They are relational properties acquired by parts when unified into a systematic whole. Constraints are distinct from primary qualities, which are intrinsic features of objects.
Unified Systems and Constraints: Constraints arise from the orderly context and unity of components within a system. For example, the anatomical connection between the tibia, peronei, and knee joint constrains the movement of the lower leg. The constraints imposed by the connection limit the range of motion and behavior of the lower leg.
Limiting Alternatives: Constraints typically restrict the degrees of freedom or limit the range of behavior of an object. They reduce the number of available options or possibilities, shaping the behavior within a specific range. This understanding of constraints as limitations is the most common interpretation.
Constraints and Organisms: While constraints may restrict certain degrees of freedom, organisms demonstrate increased complexity and a wider range of behaviors. This observation suggests that some constraints do not solely limit behavior but also enable and facilitate new possibilities, allowing organisms to exhibit greater flexibility and adaptability.
The discussion highlights the role of constraints in shaping behavior and the interplay between limitations and possibilities within complex systems. Constraints are seen as causal factors that influence the behavior of components within a system, challenging the Newtonian view of cause as external force and expanding our understanding of causality in dynamic systems.

off options (Campbell 1982).41 To do so, it is helpful to examine another 
usage of the concept of constraint . Let us return , therefore, to information 
theory , in which constraints are identified not as in physical mechanics, 
with physical connections , but with rules for reducing randomness in order 
to minimize noise and equivocation . 
Injormation- Theoretical Constraints 
Lila Gatlin quotes Weaver (of Shannon and Weaver [1949] fame) as 
saying that "this word 'information ' in communications theory relates not 
so much to what you do say, as to what you could say" (quoted in Gatlin 
1972, 48). In a situation of complete randomness where alternatives are 
equiprobable you could say anything but in fact do say nothing . Random, 
equiprobable signals are static hiss unable to transmit actual messages .42 It 
is true that in situations in which all alternatives are equally likely , potential 
information or message variety is at its maximum : before the process 
of selection in the Herman example, anyone of the employees could 
be chosen. Likewise, the equiprobability of static crackle equates with 
unpredictability and maximum freedom, in short, with the possibility 
of constant novelty- But a series of totally random or equiprobable signals

The excerpt discusses the concept of constraints as causes and their relationship to Newtonian science, modern philosophy, and information theory. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Constraints as Causal Relational Properties: The author challenges the dismissal of relational properties by Newtonian science and modern philosophy. Constraints, as described by Lindsay, are not Newtonian forces but rather features of an object's connections with the environment or its embeddedness within it. They are causal properties that influence behavior but are distinct from primary qualities like mass.
Constraints in Unified Systems: Constraints emerge in the orderly context of unified systems, not just mere aggregates. For example, the physical link between the tibia, peronei, and knee joint constrains the movement of the lower leg. This constraint restricts the lower leg's range of motion and represents a contraction of its potential behavior.
Opening and Closing of Options: While constraints typically limit or close off alternatives, organisms demonstrate increased complexity and a wider range of behaviors. This suggests that some constraints not only reduce the number of alternatives but also simultaneously create new possibilities. Understanding how constraints can open up and close off options is important.
Information-Theoretical Constraints: Information theory provides another perspective on constraints. In this context, constraints are associated with rules for reducing randomness to minimize noise and equivocation. Complete randomness lacks the ability to transmit meaningful messages, while constraints reduce randomness and increase the potential for information transmission.
Overall, the chapter explores constraints as causal relational properties that shape behavior and discusses their role in unified systems, their impact on behavior, and their connection to information theory.

Onto genetic Landscapes 
Another useful way of visualizing the dependencies and constraints of 
attractors is as onto genetic larzdscapes 
(figure 10.4) depicting a "series of 
changes of relative stability and instability " over time (Thelen and Smith 
1994 , 122 ). 
If a system accessed every point or region in its phase space with the 
same frequency as every other (that is, randomly), its onto genetic landscape 
would be smooth and flat. A completely flat, smooth initial landscape 
would portray an object with no propensities or dispositions-that 
is, with no attractors . It would describe a "system" with no identity , a 
logical impossibility. (On a graph like figure 10.1 such a "system " would 
look like TV snow.) In contrast, the increased probability that a real 
system will occupy a particular state can be represented as wells (dips or 
valleys in the landscape ) that embody attractor states and behaviors that 
the system is more likely to occupy. The deeper the valley, the greater the 
propensity of its being visited and the stronger the entrainment its attractor 
represents . 
Topologically, ridges separating basins of attraction are called separa- 
trices or repellers . Sharp peaks are saddle points representing states and 
behaviors from which the system shies away and in all likelihood will 
not access ; the probability of their occurrence is lowered or eliminated 
altogether. These landscape features capture the impact of context-sensitive 
constraints over time. Separatrix height represents the unlikelihood

stronger the perturbation needed to dislodge the system from that propensity

The excerpt discusses the concept of onto-genetic landscapes as a way to visualize the dependencies and constraints of attractors in a system. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Representation of Probability Distribution: An onto-genetic landscape depicts the series of changes in relative stability and instability over time in a system. If a system accessed every point in its phase space with the same frequency, the landscape would be smooth and flat. However, real systems are more likely to occupy certain states represented as wells (dips or valleys) in the landscape, which correspond to attractor states and behaviors.
Landscape Features: Ridges separating basins of attraction are called separatrices or repellers. Saddle points represent states and behaviors that the system is unlikely to access. The height of the separatrix represents the unlikelihood of transitioning to another attractor, while the depth of the valley indicates the strength of the attractor's pull.
Variability and Specificity of Attractors: The breadth of the floor of a basin of attraction represents the variability in states and behaviors allowed by the attractor, while a narrower valley indicates a more specific attractor with fewer possible states and behaviors.
Capturing System Identity: The probability distribution of a system's dynamics captured in the indentations of the onto-genetic landscape represents the system's identity. The landscape incorporates the effects of constraints, the role of the environment, and the system's prior experience, which all influence its behavior.
In summary, onto-genetic landscapes provide a visual representation of the probabilities and constraints that shape a system's behavior over time, capturing the relationship between attractors, their strength, and the system's propensity to access different states and behaviors.

Abstract
In the second chapter, I distinguished at least three possible approaches to understanding the landscape: the Individual-Based Perceptional Landscape (IBPL), the Individual-Based Cognitive Landscape (IBCL), and the Neutrality-Based Landscape (NBL). These three different perspectives generate processes and patterns that can be perceived moving around. If these perspectives are indicators of real processes and related patterns, we can expect to see some results in a higher-rank meta-domain. The idea that the landscape is a space in which relationships and interactions happen, or is the geography of every domain, is common to all three visions. In other words, the space is the container in which complexity happens continuously. This complexity embarrasses our science which is based more on separate parts than on relationships

The excerpt is from a chapter titled "Ontogenesis and Changes of the Landscape: A Probabilistic View" by Almo Farina. Here's a summary of the main points:
Three Approaches to Understanding the Landscape: The chapter distinguishes three possible approaches to understanding the landscape: the Individual-Based Perceptional Landscape (IBPL), the Individual-Based Cognitive Landscape (IBCL), and the Neutrality-Based Landscape (NBL). Each approach generates processes and patterns that can be observed and perceived.
Landscape as a Space of Relationships and Interactions: Regardless of the specific approach, all three perspectives agree that the landscape is a space where relationships and interactions occur. It is seen as the container or geography of every domain, where complexity continuously unfolds.
Challenging Science's Focus on Separate Parts: The continuous complexity of the landscape poses a challenge to traditional scientific approaches that tend to focus on analyzing separate parts rather than understanding the relationships and interactions between them.
The chapter likely delves deeper into each of these perspectives and their implications for understanding the landscape and its role in complex systems.

Abstract
The epigenetic landscape is a graphic metaphor proposed by Conrad H. Waddington to explain the development of organisms and their parts. It is depicted as a wavy surface with summits and descending valleys, representing the paths followed by cells along their differentiation process, as part of organismal development. Conrad H. Waddington, regarded as the father of epigenetics, stands out for his theoretical contributions, that include the notions of genetic assimilation, canalization of development and epi-genotype. These ideas were inspired by experimental works in developmental biology, that lead to the discovery of the organizer in bird embryos, as well as environmentally-induced phenocopies in Drosophila. In the current essay, I present an interpretation of the epigenetic landscape and related concepts that highlight the heuristic power of this model and its importance for contemporary biology. This work is a tribute to the life of C. H. Waddington, whose work is still of great significance.

Abstract
The evolution of powered flight in mammals required specific developmental shifts from an ancestral limb morphology to one adapted for flight. Through studies of comparative morphogenesis, investigators have quantified points and rates of divergence providing important insights into how wings evolved in mammals. Herein I compare growth,development and skeletogenesis of forelimbs between bats and the more ancestral state provided by the rat (Rattus norvegicus)and quantify growth trajectories that illustrate morphological divergence both developmentally and evolutionarily. In addition, I discuss how wing shape is controlled during morphogenesis by applying multivariate analyses of wing bones and wing membranes and discuss how flight dynamics are stabilized during flight ontogeny. Further, I discuss the development of flight in bats in relation to the ontogenetic niche and how juveniles effect populational foraging patterns. In addition, I provide a hypothetical ontogenetic landscape model that predicts how and when selection is most intense during juvenile morphogenesis and test this model with data from a population of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus.

Abstract
Mammal forelimbs are highly diverse, ranging from the elongated wing of a bat to the stout limb of the mole. The mammal forelimb has been a long-standing system for the study of early developmental patterning, proportional variation, shape change, and the reduction of elements. However, most of this work has been performed in mice, which neglects the wide variation present across mammal forelimbs. This review emphasizes the critical role of non-model systems in limb evo-devo and highlights new emerging models and their potential. We discuss the role of gene networks in limb evolution, and touch on functional analyses that lay the groundwork for further developmental studies. Mammal limb evo-devo is a rich field, and here we aim to synthesize the findings of key recent works and the questions to which they lead.

Editor's note: We are delighted to present a new, occasional series on the "evolution" of top scientists who have helped advance the case for intelligent design.

"It was like the cast of characters from an Illustra Media film."

That was biologist Ann Gauger's droll comment on her first visit to Discovery Institute's offices in Seattle. The year was 2004. Dr. Gauger's scientific credentials had caught the eye of Stephen Meyer and he had invited her to come talk with him. On the day of the meeting, Gauger arrived and settled into a conference room. In walked Meyer, Jay Richards, and Jonathan Wells — the usual suspects from Illustra films such as Unlocking the Mystery of Life. 

The occasion of the meeting went back to two weeks earlier. A friend had recommended to Gauger an article in DI's newsletter, Nota Bene. The article summarized Steve Meyer's controversial piece on the Cambrian explosion in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington.1

Gauger had been reading ID literature for some time. She was interested and decided to subscribe to Nota Bene. When she signed up, she included "PhD" after her name. "I wonder what will happen?" she mused.

Twenty minutes later, she received a phone call from Logan Gage, an administrative liaison. Logan went through a checklist. 

"You have a PhD, right?"

"Yes."

"You're aware of the Dissent from Darwin list?"

"Yes. In fact, I've already signed it."

A pregnant silence. Then a reply, "Can you send me your CV?" 

Gauger promptly did so. "I wonder what will happen?" she thought again.

Twenty minutes later, Logan was on the phone again. "Can you come in to DI to talk with Steve Meyer?" Nothing was the same after that. 

Evolution as Default
Like a number of scientists involved in the intelligent design movement, Dr. Gauger, today a Senior Fellow with the Center for Science & Culture, had accepted evolutionary theory for much of her scientific career. The theory was widely believed and seemed to explain a great many facts. Gauger held it as she pursued degrees and did research at institutions including MIT, University of Washington, and Harvard. She was well-traveled and well-studied. Evolution made sense to her.

In fact, while pursuing her doctorate in the mid 1980s, Gauger took an interest in a field rife with excitement about evolution. The field was evo-devo, a combination of evolutionary theory and developmental biology. The study of embryos and their development promised to shed light on the evolutionary history of organic life — and evolution, of course, promised to illuminate fascinating features of developmental biology. The field was buzzing. 

Researchers were particularly interested in the genes involved in early pattern formation. These genes were significant because they were thought to exercise a regulatory role in body plan development. They were said to control when other genes turned on and off, a kind of meta-level role that helped build the architecture of an organism as a whole. The hope was to identify genes that evolution used to make key innovations during organic history. In particular, evo-devo promised to explain how evolution produced new body plans.

 During this period, Gauger spent a lot of time studying invertebrate zoology. She encountered so many different body plans — sponges, clams, coral, worms, jellyfish, and the like — she wondered, "There has to be an explanation about where all these phyla came from. Some are so different." It was here, in direct contact with the diversity of body plans, that the seeds of doubt about Darwinism were sown. 

Doubts About Darwin
Yet by the time Gauger watched the Illustra movie cast walk into the room at Discovery Institute in 2004, her concerns about evolution had grown. Why? There were many reasons, yet chief among them was the Cambrian explosion.

The fossils of the Cambrian era raised the puzzle that Gauger had pondered while studying invertebrates: how did all of these different body plans emerge? Of the 27 phyla recorded in the fossil record, an astonishing 20 of them emerged during the Cambrian explosion. Only 3 phyla appear before the Cambrian, and only 4 others appear after that era.2 It is the major event within organic history.

Gauger also realized that the neo-Darwinian mechanism lacked the creative power to generate so many new body plans in the time available.3 And even the promise of evo-devo had fallen short. In particular, Gauger was impressed with the Nobel Prize-winning work of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus. These geneticists had studied the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, mapping its genome and analyzing is early development. They discovered that mutating or perturbing early-acting body plan molecules invariably kills the fruit fly.4 In order to generate a genuinely new body plan, early embryonic changes must take place. Yet for evolution to occur, these changes must be viable rather than lethal. By contrast, Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus observed that early developmental mutants never even hatched as larvae.5 Other problems plagued evo-devo, too.6

 Moreover, Gauger's own research after 2004 helped illuminate key problems for evolutionary theory. Among others, she articulated the causal circularity problem,7 the waiting times problem,8 and the implausibility of human evolution.9 Gauger has also helped to show that a first couple is possible in the context of human origins.10 And more on the way: a volume she has edited on the positive case for intelligent design, by contributors arguing from a Catholic perspective, is just around the corner.11

Full Circle
Gauger recalls with a chuckle her initial meeting with the Illustra cast in 2004. "Steve Meyer walked me through his PowerPoint presentation on the Cambrian explosion. He had the right argument. But I spotted a typo and said so."

The "typo," as it turns out, was a technical point about invertebrates. Only someone well-versed in the field would have had that kind of knowledge. Dr. Gauger's years of research and study had prepared her perfectly for the road ahead.12

You remember Pravda and Izvestia, the official propaganda organs of the former USSR. (That's the editorial offices of Pravda pictured above.) Having silenced the free press long ago, these "newspapers" were free to dole out the party line without opposition, giving the impression to unwary readers that there was no opposition. Well, here is a major science journal that followed this strategy.

A Treasure Trove
To celebrate its 25th anniversary, Current Biology offered a special issue on "The History of Life on Earth." The 16 open-access articles amount to a treasure trove of evolutionary thinking on a wide variety of subjects: RNA World, insect evolution, bird evolution, and more — all presented by big-name Darwinian proponents who ignore alternative views. A case in point is the primer on "The Cambrian Explosion" by Derek E. G. Briggs. Any mention of critiques of the Darwinian explanation? Nope. Intelligent design? Are you kidding?

One might think that the editors would find it strategic to allay the fears of readers worried about the challenge to Darwinism raised, for example, by Stephen Meyer's bestseller Darwin's Doubt by answering it. Not at all. That seems a risky strategy, considering that Meyer and others cogently responded to their critics' best objections in a follow-up book, Debating Darwin's Doubt. It's hard to imagine Briggs or the editors being unaware of these books. Apparently they think that enough of their readers don't know of the controversy, or they don't wish to give Meyer publicity.

It's interesting to see what Derek Briggs is willing to admit about the Cambrian explosion (emphasis added):

It's real: "We now know that the sudden appearance of fossils in the Cambrian (541-485 million years ago) is real and not an artefact of an imperfect fossil record," he says.
It saw diverse body plans: "In effect, the major body plans or phyla were establishedduring the Cambrian explosion," but how? (Keep reading.)
Hard parts were not required: "Exceptionally preserved Cambrian fossil deposits, such as the famous Burgess Shale, yield examples of 14 of the 19 soft-bodied phyla" of the ~33 animal phyla recognized today.
Not oddballs: "The affinities of some of the Cambrian creatures that were dubbed 'weird wonders' are still debated but phylogenetic analyses have shown that most of them are much less weird than first thought — they do not represent extinct higher taxa, but are early offshoots of the lineages leading to modern groups."
Complex parts: "Various arthropods from the Cambrian of China have recently been shown to preserve evidence of the brain and nervous system, which were fossilized in rapidly precipitating minerals," Briggs says.
No answers: "The drivers behind the Cambrian explosion were varied and complex, and there is no simple explanation of either the timing or ecological mechanism involved." All he can do is offer possibilities.
Bottom line: Briggs is still looking for clues about how "all the major animal groups evolved in a relatively short time during the Cambrian explosion."
You see that Briggs doesn't dispute the observable facts. He knows that the major animal body plans appeared quickly.

So What Is His Explanation?
He stretches out the explosion, giving it the largest possible range of 56 million years. 10 million years is more widely accepted, but no matter how many years are granted, the problems of missing ancestors and abrupt appearances remain.
He considers the Ediacaran period ancestral to the Cambrian, asserting that this resolves "Darwin's dilemma" about the missing Precambrian fossils. "Darwin's dilemma regarding the absence of Precambrian fossils was not resolved until the 1940s when a diversity of large animals of Ediacaran age (635-541 million years ago) was discovered in South Australia, providing spectacular evidence of life prior to the appearance of the first shells." This is very misleading, as most biologists do not consider the Ediacaran organisms ancestral to the Cambrian animals.
He makes the most of early arrivals: "However, a number of Ediacaran fossils are interpreted with reasonable certainty as early offshoots (stem taxa) of lineages leading to modern groups — including sponges (Palaeophragmodictya), cnidarians, and bilaterians such as molluscs (Kimberella) and possibly arthropods." This misdirects attention from the complexity of these phyla, and fails to account for at least 15 more new body plans that exploded onto the scene in the early Cambrian.
He puts a lot of trust in molecular inferences: "Molecular clock dates indicate that the ancestors of most modern marine phyla had evolved by the Ediacaran, but identifying their representatives, even among the remarkable range of Ediacaran forms, is not straightforward." His conclusion is more confident: "Phylogenies calibrated by fossil occurrences allow molecular clocks to estimate the timing of branching even where fossil evidence is wanting."
He uses the power of suggestion: "The rise of oxygen levels in the earth's atmosphere and oceans has often been implicated in initiating rapid diversification." We've responded to this "oxygen theory" before. Another suggestion: "The rise of zooplankton allowed particles to sink to the sea floor as fecal material which significantly augmented the nutrient supply," he speculates. "Such increases in environmental complexity during the Cambrian may well have resulted in a proliferation of diverse ecological strategies that were not present earlier." Should we call this the crap theory?
He offers promissory notes: "And in due course, experiments on the role of control genes in the development of animals from embryo to adult may provide clues to how all the major animal groups evolved in a relatively short time during the Cambrian explosion."

The article by David Coppedge criticizes a special issue of Current Biology on "The History of Life on Earth" for presenting a one-sided view of evolutionary thinking without considering alternative views or addressing critiques of the Darwinian explanation. Coppedge argues that the articles in the special issue ignore the controversy raised by Stephen Meyer's book Darwin's Doubt and fail to engage with the arguments put forth by proponents of intelligent design.
The article specifically focuses on Derek E. G. Briggs' primer on "The Cambrian Explosion" within the special issue. Coppedge highlights some points that Briggs acknowledges, such as the sudden appearance of fossils in the Cambrian, the diversity of body plans, the preservation of soft-bodied phyla, and the complexity of certain organisms. However, Coppedge criticizes Briggs for not providing satisfactory explanations for the Cambrian explosion and for relying on speculative ideas, such as the rise of oxygen levels and the increase in environmental complexity, without concrete evidence.
Coppedge also questions Briggs' inclusion of the Ediacaran period as ancestral to the Cambrian and suggests that most biologists do not consider the Ediacaran organisms as direct precursors to Cambrian animals. Furthermore, he criticizes Briggs for relying on molecular inferences and suggests that more research is needed to understand the role of control genes in animal development during the Cambrian explosion.
Overall, the article portrays the special issue of Current Biology as propagandistic, presenting a biased view of evolutionary thinking and failing to address the challenges and critiques raised by proponents of intelligent design. Coppedge argues that the explanations provided for the Cambrian explosion are insufficient and that more research is needed to fully understand this significant event in the history of life on Earth.

Abstract
How life emerged from inanimate matter is one of the most intriguing questions posed to modern science. Central to this research are experimental attempts to build systems capable of Darwinian evolution. RNA catalysts (ribozymes) are a promising avenue, in line with the RNA world hypothesis whereby RNA pre-dated DNA and proteins. Since evolution in living organisms relies on template-based replication, the identification of a ribozyme capable of replicating itself (an RNA self-replicase) has been a major objective. However, no self-replicase has been identified to date. Alternatively, autocatalytic systems involving multiple RNA species capable of ligation and recombination may enable self-reproduction. However, it remains unclear how evolution could emerge in autocatalytic systems. In this review, we examine how experimentally feasible RNA reactions catalysed by ribozymes could implement the evolutionary properties of variation, heredity and reproduction, and ultimately allow for Darwinian evolution. We propose a gradual path for the emergence of evolution, initially supported by autocatalytic systems leading to the later appearance of RNA replicases

The article you mentioned, titled "Abiogenesis through gradual evolution of autocatalysis into template-based replication," explores the question of how life originated from non-living matter and focuses on experimental attempts to construct systems capable of Darwinian evolution. Specifically, the authors investigate the role of RNA catalysts (ribozymes) and their potential as self-replicating entities.
The study builds upon the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that RNA played a crucial role in early life forms before the emergence of DNA and proteins. While the identification of a self-replicating ribozyme (RNA self-replicase) has been a significant goal in this field, no such ribozyme has been found thus far. As an alternative, the authors explore autocatalytic systems involving multiple RNA species capable of ligation and recombination, which could enable self-reproduction.
The review delves into how RNA reactions catalyzed by ribozymes can implement key evolutionary properties such as variation, heredity, and reproduction. It aims to elucidate how autocatalytic systems may pave the way for the emergence of evolution and eventually lead to the appearance of RNA replicases.
By examining experimentally feasible scenarios, the authors propose a gradual pathway for the emergence of evolution. This pathway involves the initial establishment of autocatalytic systems, which later evolve to incorporate template-based replication mechanisms, potentially leading to the development of RNA replicases.
Overall, the article seeks to shed light on the plausible mechanisms by which autocatalytic systems and template-based replication could contribute to the emergence of evolution and the transition from inanimate matter to the complex systems found in living organisms.

The article you mentioned, "Abiogenesis through gradual evolution of autocatalysis into template-based replication," relates to the earlier topics we discussed in the context of the origin and evolution of life. It addresses the question of how life emerged from non-living matter, which is a fundamental aspect of evolutionary biology.
In the context of the earlier discussions on genetic landscapes, attractors, and ontogeny, this article focuses on the early stages of life's development and the emergence of evolutionary properties. It explores the potential role of autocatalytic systems and ribozymes (RNA catalysts) in facilitating self-reproduction and template-based replication, which are essential components of evolutionary processes.
The concept of autocatalysis, which involves self-sustaining chemical reactions, can be related to the discussion on attractors and basins of attraction. Autocatalytic systems have the capacity to undergo self-replication and exhibit certain stability and persistence, akin to attractors in a genetic landscape.

Dissipative structures, free energy minimization

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the context of the topics we've discussed, dissipative structures and free energy minimization are relevant concepts related to the dynamics and organization of complex systems.
Dissipative structures refer to self-organizing systems that are far from thermodynamic equilibrium. These systems maintain their structure and stability by dissipating energy and exchanging matter with their environment. They arise through a process of self-organization, where the system undergoes non-linear interactions and feedback loops that give rise to emergent patterns and structures.
Free energy minimization is a principle that governs the behavior of complex systems, including living organisms. It is based on the idea that systems tend to minimize their free energy or maximize their entropy to achieve a state of stability and equilibrium. Free energy can be understood as the potential energy available to a system to perform work or drive its internal processes.
In the context of evolutionary biology, dissipative structures and free energy minimization are relevant for understanding the emergence and maintenance of complex biological systems. Living organisms are open systems that continuously exchange energy and matter with their environment to maintain their organization and sustain their biological functions. They exhibit self-organizing behavior and adapt to environmental changes by minimizing free energy and maximizing their fitness.
The concept of attractors, which we discussed earlier, is related to the notion of dissipative structures. Attractors represent stable states or patterns to which a system tends to converge over time. These attractors can be seen as regions of low free energy or high stability, where the system minimizes its energy expenditure and maintains its organization.
In summary, dissipative structures and free energy minimization are important concepts in understanding the dynamics and organization of complex systems, including biological systems. They provide insights into the self-organizing behavior of living organisms and their ability to adapt and evolve in response to environmental conditions.

Abstract
Bernal first suggested the role of clay minerals in the origin of life because of the ordered arrangement of the clay mineral particles, the large adsorption capacity, shielding against ultraviolet radiation, ability to concentrate organic chemicals and ability to serve as polymerization templates. Clay minerals were proposed as possible genetic material. This appealing hypothesis was not yet supported by experimental data. Many experiments were run to correlate biological one-handedness to clay mineral chemistry but convincing data were not obtained. However, clay minerals act as very efficient catalysts in the polymerization of amino acids and nucleotides, thus supporting the possible existence of an RNA world preceding a cellular world. RNA adsorbed to clay minerals can be encapsulated within vesicles. Once formed, such vesicles could grow by incorporating fatty acids and divide, thus mediating vesicle replication through cycles of growth and division. The data obtained so far suggest that clay minerals played an active role in the abiotic origin of life

The article titled "Chapter 7.4 Clay Minerals and the Origin of Life" by Andre Brack explores the potential role of clay minerals in the origin of life. The author discusses the characteristics of clay minerals that make them appealing in the context of life's emergence, such as their ordered arrangement, adsorption capacity, shielding properties against ultraviolet radiation, and potential to concentrate organic chemicals. Clay minerals have been proposed as possible genetic material and templates for polymerization.
While the hypothesis of clay minerals' involvement in the origin of life is appealing, the article acknowledges that experimental data supporting this hypothesis are still limited. The author discusses efforts to correlate the chemistry of clay minerals with the emergence of biological chirality (the preference for certain handedness in biological molecules), but conclusive evidence has not been obtained thus far.
However, the article highlights that clay minerals have been found to be efficient catalysts in the polymerization of amino acids and nucleotides. This supports the idea of an RNA world preceding a cellular world, where RNA molecules may have played a central role in early life processes. The author discusses the adsorption of RNA to clay minerals and the possibility of encapsulation within vesicles. These vesicles could grow by incorporating fatty acids and undergo division, potentially facilitating replication through cycles of growth and division.
In conclusion, the article suggests that clay minerals may have played an active role in the abiotic origin of life. While further research and experimental evidence are needed to fully understand the extent of their contribution, clay minerals offer intriguing possibilities in terms of their catalytic properties and potential involvement in early life processes.

INTRODUCTION 
The origin of life approximately four billion years ago was a 
geochemical event, dependent on reactions among the Archean 
oceans, a primitive atmosphere, and rocks and minerals. This hy- 
pothesis of "chemical evolution," like any valid scientif i c model, 
leads to numerous testable predictions: Life must have emerged 
as a sequence of chemical steps of increasing complexity, and 
each of these chemical steps must be subject to conf i rmation in 
reproducible laboratory experiments. 
This naturalistic view of life's origin, though widely accepted 
within the scientif i c community, can evoke as much public con- 
troversy as any topic in science. In particular, intelligent design 
(ID) represents a highly publicized and intensely criticized 
rival hypothesis to chemical evolution (Scott 2004; Forrest and 
Gross 2004). According to supporters of the ID model, life is 
too complex to have arisen by natural chemical processes (Behe 
1996; Dembski 1999). Life requires hundreds or thousands of 
interconnected chemical reactions; consequently, ID supporters 
fi nd it diff i cult to imagine a step-wise process from simplicity 
to complexity. Indeed, according to this view, life is "irreducibly 
complex." The logical conclusion, according to ID proponents, 
is that a supernatural designer—either an alien or God—must 
have engineered life on Earth. In this view, life arose by some 
combination of natural and supernatural events. 
Most philosophers of science argue that intelligent design does 
not rise to the standards of an acceptable scientif i c hypothesis, 
because it relies on supernatural processes to explain the natural 
world. This dependence on miracles not only invalidates ID as 
science, but it also represents suspect theology (Miller 1999; 
Pennock 1999; Fry 2000; Hazen 2005a, 2005b; Bertka 2006). ID 
relies on the discredited "God in the gaps" argument, by which 
one resorts to supernatural explanations if a natural phenomenon 
is seemingly too complex to understand as a lawful process. 
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO THE MINERALOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA, SALT LAKE CITY, OCTOBER 18, 2005 
Mineral surfaces and the prebiotic selection and organization of biomolecules 
ROBERT M. HAZEN* 
Carnegie Institution, Geophysical Laboratory and NASA Astrobiology Institute, 5251 Broad Branch Road NW, Washington, D.C. 20015, U.S.A. 
ABSTRACT 
One of the most enigmatic steps in Earth's ancient transition from a lifeless planet to a living world 
was the process or processes by which prebiotic organic molecules were selected, concentrated, and 
organized into the essential macromolecules of life. More than a half-century of theory and experi- 
ment points to the critical roles of mineral surfaces in the assembly of proteins, lipid bilayers, and 
genetic polymers. This review considers three aspects of this problem: (1) the self-assembly of lipids, 
which may be enhanced in the presence of minerals; (2) the role of minerals in polymerization of 
amino acids and nucleic acids; and (3) the selective adsorption of organic species, including chiral 
molecules, onto mineral surfaces. 
Keywords: Surface studies, calcite, quartz, feldspar, new technique, microarray, origin of life 
Supporters of ID point to the origin of life as the quintessential 
example of irreducible complexity. Ultimately, the most powerful 
response to any God in the gaps argument is to fi ll in the gaps, 
in this case by a research program that demonstrates a natural 
transition from the chemical simplicity of the Hadean Earth to 
the emergent complexity of the fi rst living cell. If such biological 
complexity can be shown to arise spontaneously as the result of 
lawful, natural processes, then the central tenet of ID regarding 
life's supposed miraculous origin is invalidated. 
The objective of this Presidential Address is to outline such 
a scenario for the origin of life on Earth based on the hypothesis 
that life's genesis is an example of the more general natural phe- 
nomenon of emergent complexity (Holland 1995, 1998; Morow- 
itz 2002; Hazen 2005a). In this summary I place special emphasis 
on one of the most signif i cant gaps in our present understanding 
of life's origin—the selection, concentration, and organization of 
biomolecules into life's essential macromolecules. In particular, 
I elaborate some of the processes by which mineral surfaces may 
have facilitated this key emergent step in the ancient transition 
from geochemistry to biochemistry. 
THE EMERGENCE OF LIFE 
The origin of life on Earth can be modeled as a sequence of 
emergent steps, each of which added chemical complexity to the 
geochemical world (Hazen 2001a, 2005a). Emergent complexity 
commonly arises in systems of numerous interacting particles, or 
"agents," as energy fl ows through the system (Prigogine 1980; 
Holland 1998; Morowitz 2002). Numerous examples include 
the shapes of sand dunes and ripples (Bagnold 1941, 1988; 
Hansen et al. 2001), the formation of galactic spiral structures 
(Bertin 1980; Carlberg and Freedman 1985), and the behavior 
of myriad biological systems such as slime mold, ant colonies, 
and the conscious brain (Solé and Goodwin 2000; Camazine 
et al. 2001). The emergence of life required at least four such 
steps: (1) the emergence of biomolecules, (2) the emergence of

HAZEN: MINERALS AND THE PREBIOTIC SELECTION OF 
BIOMOLECULES1716 
macromolecular systems, (3) the emergence of self-replicating 
cycles of molecules, and (4) the emergence of molecular evolu- 
tion by natural selection (Hazen 2005a). 
The fi rst of these emergent steps, the prebiotic synthesis of 
biomolecules, is also the best understood. Since the pioneering 
synthesis studies of Stanley Miller and Harold Urey (Miller 1953, 
1955; Miller and Urey 1959; see also Wills and Bada 2000), 
facile production of organic molecules has been demonstrated 
for several plausible prebiotic environments (Chyba and Sagan 
1992; Lahav 1999; Fry 2000; Hazen 2005a). Amino acids, sugars, 
lipids, and many other biomolecules have been produced under 
conditions simulating Earth's Archean atmosphere (Lerman 
1994a, 1994b, 1996; Ellison et al. 1999; Dobson et al. 2000; 
Tuck 2002), mid-ocean hydrothermal systems (Hennet et al. 
1992; Marshall 1994; Russell and Hall 1997; Brandes et al. 1998; 
McCollom and Simoneit 1999; Cody et al. 2000, 2001, 2004), 
and surface and shallow subsurface environments (Miller and 
Urey 1959; Oró 1960, 1961; Reid and Orgel 1967; Shapiro 1988, 
1995; Wills and Bada 2000), as well as interstellar and nebular 
environments (Bernstein et al. 1999; Ehrenfreund and Charnley 
2000; Dworkin et al. 2001). 
More problematic is the second emergent step by which 
life's idiosyncratic subset of biomolecules was selected and then 
concentrated from the dilute, diverse suite of prebiotic molecular 
species that must have accumulated in the primitive oceans. 
Consider the problem of amino acids. More than 70 different 
amino acids have been extracted from the carbon-rich Murchison 
meteorite (Cronin and Chang 1993). This inventory, moreover, 
contains a mixture of both left- and right-handed amino acids. 
Life, by contrast, employs only 20 principal amino acids and 
these molecules occur almost exclusively in their so-called "left- 
handed" forms. Life's sugars, lipids, and polycyclic molecules 
exhibit similar molecular selectivity (Nelson and Cox 2004; 
Hazen 2005a). By what process did this molecular selection and 
concentration occur? 
Mineral surfaces have long been recognized as having the 
potential to select and organize organic molecules in the path 
from geochemistry to biochemistry. In 1945 Victor Goldschmidt 
speculated: "Assemblage on corresponding crystal faces of en- 
antiomorphic pairs of crystals, such as right-hand and left-hand 
quartz crystals, would provide us with a most simple and direct 
possibility of localized separate assemblage of right- and left- 
hand asymmetric molecules" (Goldschmidt 1952, p.101). John 
Desmond Bernal (1951) expressed similar views in his inf l uential 
text, The Physical Basis of Life, wherein he advocated the special 
role of clays in life's origins. 
In the following sections, I consider three aspects of min- 
eral-mediated molecular selection and organization: (1) the 
self-assembly of lipids into spherical cell-like structures called 
vesicles, the formation of which may be enhanced in the pres- 
ence of minerals; (2) the role of minerals in the polymerization 
of amino acids and nucleic acids; and (3) the selective adsorption 
and concentration of organic species, including the challenging 
problem of chiral molecular selection, onto mineral surfaces. 
MOLECULAR SELF-ORGANIZATION 
The simplest mode of molecular selection is self-organiza- 
tion, which is a phenomenon displayed most dramatically by 
amphiphilic molecules. Amphiphilic molecules possess both 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions—a situation that can lead 
to spontaneous self-organization in an aqueous environment 
(Tanford 1978; Deamer and Pashley 1989; Segré et al. 2001; 
Deamer 2003). The elongated phospholipid molecules that form 
most cell membranes provide an important example. Each of 
these molecules has two hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains at one 
end and a hydrophilic phosphate group at the other. When the 
concentration of phospholipid molecules in solution achieves 
a critical minimum value, they then self-organize into vesicles 
(Fig. 1), which are enclosed bilayer structures with only hydro- 
philic regions exposed to water (Bangham et al. 1965; Deamer 
2003). 
Self-organizing lipids have been identif i ed and concentrated 
from a variety of plausible prebiotic sources of organic molecules 
(Hazen 2005a). In a landmark study, Deamer and Pashley (1989) 
extracted a suite of self-organizing amphiphiles from the Mur- 
chison carbonaceous chondrite. They concluded: "If amphiphilic 
substances derived from meteoric infall and chemical evolution 
were available on the prebiotic earth following condensation 
of oceans, it follows that surface fi lms would have been pres- 
ent at air-water interfaces. ... This material would thereby be 
concentrated for self-assembly into boundary structures with 
barrier properties relevant to function as early membranes" (p. 
37). Subsequent synthesis experiments in simulated deep space 
(Dworkin et al. 2001) and hydrothermal (Hazen 2005a) environ- 
ments also reveal vesicle-forming fractions.

Clay Minerals: The article discusses the role of mineral surfaces, including clay minerals, in the prebiotic selection and organization of biomolecules. Clay minerals have long been recognized for their potential to select and organize organic molecules due to their ordered arrangement, large adsorption capacity, and ability to serve as polymerization templates. The article references the work of Bernal and Goldschmidt, who proposed the role of clay minerals in the origin of life.
Abiogenesis: The article explores the process of chemical evolution and the emergence of life from inanimate matter. It discusses the prebiotic synthesis of biomolecules, such as amino acids and nucleic acids, under plausible prebiotic conditions. The article highlights the role of mineral surfaces in facilitating the selection, concentration, and organization of these biomolecules into essential macromolecules for life.
Free Energy Minimization: While the article does not explicitly mention free energy minimization, it discusses the self-assembly of lipids into vesicles, which is a process driven by the minimization of free energy. Lipid molecules self-organize into vesicles, which are enclosed bilayer structures, with hydrophilic regions exposed to water. This self-organization occurs when the concentration of lipid molecules reaches a critical minimum value, leading to the formation of vesicles. The article suggests that mineral surfaces enhance this self-assembly process.
Overall, the article provides insights into how mineral surfaces, including clay minerals, contribute to the origin of life by facilitating the selection, concentration, and organization of biomolecules.

To explain the connection between mineral evolution and autocatalytic sets and dissipating structures, we first need to understand the formation of clay minerals on Earth.

It is believed that the constant mashing and thrashing of the surface by the moon, which was formed very close to the Earth after a giant impact with a wide-angle, contributed to the formation of clay minerals.

This process, which we call the Lunar Lunch Model, was possible because the moon generated heat and tidal forces on the Earth's surface, leading to the formation of clay minerals.

These clay minerals are important because they have the ability to act as autocatalytic sets, which are self-sustaining chemical systems that can reproduce and evolve over time.

In other words, they can facilitate the formation of other complex molecules and structures by catalyzing chemical reactions.

This is similar to how life itself works, as living organisms are also made up of autocatalytic sets that sustain and evolve themselves over time.

Furthermore, these clay minerals also form dissipating structures, which are systems that can lower their own entropy by increasing the entropy of their surroundings.

In other words, they can dissipate energy in a controlled manner, which is crucial for sustaining complex systems like autocatalytic sets.

The formation and evolution of these autocatalytic sets and dissipating structures in the early Earth environment led to the emergence of increasingly complex mineral structures and eventually paved the way for the evolution of life itself.

Robert Hazen is one of the researchers who has studied this connection between mineral evolution and the emergence of life, and his work highlights the importance of understanding the physical and chemical processes that underlie the origins of life on Earth.

The connection between mineral evolution and autocatalytic sets lies in the ability of clay minerals to act as catalysts for chemical reactions, including the polymerization of amino acids and nucleotides. These clay minerals provide a surface for the assembly and organization of biomolecules, promoting the formation of autocatalytic sets.
Autocatalytic sets are self-sustaining systems in which the products of one reaction serve as catalysts for other reactions within the set. The clay minerals can facilitate the formation of these autocatalytic sets by providing a structured environment and promoting the concentration and interaction of the necessary molecules.
Dissipative structures, on the other hand, are self-organizing systems that maintain a steady state by dissipating energy. Clay minerals, through their surface properties and interactions with surrounding molecules, can form dissipative structures that lower their own entropy by increasing the entropy of their surroundings. This ability to dissipate energy is crucial for the sustained functioning of autocatalytic sets and the emergence of complexity in chemical systems.
By studying the formation and evolution of clay minerals and their interactions with organic molecules, researchers like Robert Hazen have provided insights into the connection between mineral evolution and the emergence of life. This research highlights the importance of understanding the role of minerals in the origins of life and the complex processes that led to the development of increasingly intricate structures and systems.

A detailed explanation of the lunar lunch model. Remember the moon was formed in a synestia close to the surface and so was 60 times closer, tides where a thousand feet high, gravity from moon was inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

The Lunar Lunch Model proposes that the formation of clay minerals on the early Earth and Moon was influenced by the tidal forces generated by the Moon's proximity and impact. To understand this model in detail, we need to consider the unique conditions that existed during the early stages of the Moon's formation and its close proximity to the Earth.
The model suggests that the Moon was formed as a result of a giant impact between a Mars-sized body and the early Earth. This impact created a massive amount of energy and led to the ejection of debris into space. The debris eventually coalesced to form the Moon.
During the formation of the Moon, a transient structure called a synestia is believed to have existed. A synestia is a rapidly rotating, doughnut-shaped structure of vaporized rock and gas. In this synestia, the Moon was much closer to the Earth than it is today, approximately 60 times closer.
The close proximity of the Moon had significant effects on the Earth's surface, particularly in terms of tidal forces. Tidal forces arise from the gravitational interaction between two bodies, and they can cause deformations on a planetary scale. With the Moon being so close, the tidal forces generated were much stronger than they are currently.
The tides caused by the Moon's proximity were enormous, reaching heights of thousands of feet. These extreme tides created dynamic and chaotic conditions on the Earth's surface, which played a crucial role in the formation of clay minerals.
Clay minerals are formed through the weathering and alteration of rocks under specific conditions. The intense tides and the associated mixing and churning of the Earth's surface caused by the Moon's gravity contributed to the breakdown of rocks and the release of mineral particles. These mineral particles then underwent processes such as sedimentation and chemical reactions, eventually leading to the formation of clay minerals.
Furthermore, the close proximity of the Moon also influenced the distribution of minerals and the concentration of organic molecules on the Earth's surface. The strong tidal forces could have led to the transportation and deposition of mineral-rich materials, which could have facilitated the formation of clay minerals in localized regions.
In summary, the Lunar Lunch Model suggests that the formation of clay minerals on the early Earth and Moon was influenced by the intense tidal forces generated by the Moon's proximity. These forces contributed to the breakdown of rocks, the release of mineral particles, and the subsequent formation of clay minerals. The model provides an explanation for the prevalence of clay minerals on Earth and their potential role in the emergence of life.

No direct evidence yet documents Earth's tidal cycles more than a billion years ago, but we can be confident that 4.5 billion years ago things were a lot wilder. Not only did Earth have five-hour days, but the nearby Moon was much, much faster in its close orbit, as well. The Moon took only eighty-four hours—three and a half modern days—to go around Earth. With Earth spinning so fast and the Moon orbiting so fast, the familiar cycle of new Moon, waxing Moon, full Moon, and waning Moon played out in frenetic fast-forward: every few five-hour days saw a new lunar phase. Lots of consequences follow from this truth, some less benign than others. With such a big lunar obstruction in the sky and such rapid orbital motions, eclipses would have been frequent events. A total solar eclipse would have occurred every eighty-four hours at virtually every new Moon, when the Moon was positioned between Earth and the Sun. For some few minutes, sunlight would have been completely blocked, while the stars and planets suddenly popped out against a black sky, and the Moon's fiery volcanoes and magma oceans stood out starkly red against the black lunar disk. Total lunar eclipses occurred regularly as well, almost every forty-two hours later, like clockwork. During every full Moon, when Earth lies right between the Sun and the Moon, Earth's big shadow would have completely obscured the giant face of the bright shining Moon. Once again the stars and planets would have suddenly popped out against a black sky, as the Moon's volcanoes put on their ruddy show. Monster tides were a far more violent consequence of the Moon's initial proximity. Had both Earth and the Moon been perfectly rigid solid bodies, they would appear today much as they did 4.5 billion years ago: 15,000 miles apart with rapid rotational and orbital motions and frequent eclipses. But Earth and the Moon are not rigid. Their rocks can flex and bend; especially when molten, they swell and recede with the tides. The young Moon, at a distance of 15,000 miles, exerted tremendous tidal forces on Earth's rocks, even as Earth exerted an equal and opposite gravitational force on the largely molten lunar landscape. It's difficult to imagine the immense magma tides that resulted. Every few hours Earth's largely molten rocky surface may have bulged a mile or more outward toward the Moon, generating tremendous internal friction, adding more heat and thus keeping the surface molten far longer than on an isolated planet. And Earth's gravity returned the favor, bulging the Earth-facing side of the Moon outward, deforming our satellite out of perfect roundness.

Thank you for providing additional information about the early Earth-Moon system. The details you shared align with the understanding that during the early stages of Earth and Moon's formation, the tidal forces were indeed much stronger due to the Moon's close proximity and the rapid rotational and orbital motions.
The intense tidal forces exerted by the Moon on the Earth had significant effects on the planet's surface. As you mentioned, the tidal forces resulted in immense magma tides, with Earth's molten rocky surface bulging outward toward the Moon every few hours. These tidal deformations generated tremendous internal friction and added more heat to the system, keeping the Earth's surface molten for a longer duration than it would have been otherwise.
On the other hand, Earth's gravity influenced the Moon as well, causing a bulging of the Earth-facing side of the Moon and deforming its shape. These tidal interactions between Earth and the Moon contributed to the overall dynamic and chaotic nature of the early Earth-Moon system.
It is worth noting that while there is no direct evidence documenting Earth's tidal cycles from over a billion years ago, scientific models and understanding of celestial mechanics support the idea that the tidal forces were much stronger during the early stages of Earth-Moon interaction. The details provided in Hazen's book, "The Story of Earth: The First 4.5 Billion Years, from Stardust to Living Planet," offer a comprehensive overview of these concepts and their implications for the formation and evolution of our planet.
These intense tidal forces and dynamic interactions in the early Earth-Moon system have important implications for various geological and chemical processes that took place during that time. Understanding these processes provides insights into the conditions that influenced the formation of minerals, such as clay minerals, on the Earth and their potential role in the origins of life.
Thank you for providing the additional context, and I hope this explanation helps to connect the Lunar Lunch Model and the dynamic interactions between Earth and the Moon to the formation of clay minerals and other geological processes in the early Earth.

Mineral Surfaces, Geochemical Complexities, and the Origins of Life

Abstract
Crystalline surfaces of common rock-forming minerals are likely to have played several important roles in life's geochemical origins. Transition metal sulfides and oxides promote a variety of organic reactions, including nitrogen reduction, hydroformylation, amination, and Fischer-Tropsch-type synthesis. Fine-grained clay minerals and hydroxides facilitate lipid self-organization and condensation polymerization reactions, notably of RNA monomers. Surfaces of common rock-forming oxides, silicates, and carbonates select and concentrate specific amino acids, sugars, and other molecular species, while potentially enhancing their thermal stabilities. Chiral surfaces of these minerals also have been shown to separate left- and right-handed molecules. Thus, mineral surfaces may have contributed centrally to the linked prebiotic problems of containment and organization by promoting the transition from a dilute prebiotic "soup" to highly ordered local domains of key biomolecules.

The question of life's origin is in essence a problem of information transfer from a geochemical environment to a highly localized volume. Earth's prebiotic environment possessed a varied inventory of raw materials—an atmosphere, oceans, rocks and minerals, and a diverse suite of small organic molecules. The processes by which the Hadean Earth was transformed to a living world required the selection, concentration, and organization of specific organic molecules into successively more information-rich localized assemblages. In this view, life's origins can be modeled as a problem in emergent chemical complexification (Morowitz 1992; de Duve 1995; Lahav 1999; Hazen 2005; Zaikowski and Friedrich 2007).

At least five aspects of Hadean geochemical environments contributed to Earth's prebiotic complexity and thus may have played significant roles in the emergence of life.

Chemical Complexity: The simplest chemical models for life's origins use only four essential elements—C, H, O, and N (e.g., Oparin 1938; Urey 1951; Morowitz 1992; Morowitz et al. 2000)—with the possible addition of S (Wächtershäuser 1990; de Duve 1995) and/or P (Westheimer 1987; Kornberg et al. 1999). Experiments to probe origins-of-life chemistry have often used correspondingly simple chemical systems (Miller 1953; Fox and Harada 1958; Oró 1961; Sanchez et al. 1967; Shapiro 1988; Hennet et al. 1992; Marshall 1994; Eschenmoser 1999; Bernstein et al. 2002). Geochemical environments, in contrast, typically incorporate a dozen or more major and minor elements, with dozens more trace elements (Turekian 1968; Albarède and Hoffmann 2003; McSween et al. 2003; Steele et al. 2009). Therefore, it is important to consider the roles of a wider chemical spectrum in essential prebiotic reaction pathways.
Interfaces: Even given the most optimistic assessments of exogenous and endogenous sources of prebiotic organic molecules (Chyba and Sagan 1992), the Hadean oceans or large terrestrial bodies of water would have been extremely dilute (Pinto et al. 1980; Stribling and Miller 1987; Cohn et al. 2001). Mechanisms for the selection and concentration of essential biomolecules are thus required. In this regard, numerous authors have focused on the effectiveness of interfaces between minerals and aqueous solutions (Goldschmidt 1952; Cairns-Smith and Hartman 1986; Lahav 1994; Ertem and Ferris 1996; Ferris 1999, 2005; Ertem 2002; Schoonen et al. 2004; Hazen 2006), or among immiscible fluids (Lasaga et al. 1971; Deamer and Pashley 1989; Morowitz 1992; Dobson et al. 2000; Tuck 2002; Monnard et al. 2002). Such surfaces provide loci where organic molecules can be selected and concentrated from more dilute solutions.
Gradients: Gradients were important disequilibrium features of the Hadean Earth. Thermal gradients were sustained both by solar radiation and by geothermal heat, whereas chemical gradients were produced by mineral dissolution and the mixing of different fluid reservoirs. Thermal and chemical gradients are striking characteristics of hydrothermal systems, both on the deep ocean floor and in near-surface continental environments. At modern-day deep sea hydrothermal vents, for example, thermal gradients may reach 300°C at scales of a few centimeters, whereas significant gradients in pH, oxidation state, and in dissolved cationic and anionic species occur at scales significantly less than a meter (Shock 1992; Carl 1995; Van Dover 2000; Kelley et al. 2005). Less severe gradients also occur at off-axis hydrothermal systems, and during mixing of fluids of differing salinities, for example where river waters enter the oceans.
Fluxes: The dynamic circulation and mixing of fluids through such varied processes as hydrothermal venting, ocean currents, stream and groundwater flow, winds, and tides is another ubiquitous disequilibrium feature of Earth's near-surface environment.
Cycles: The prebiotic geochemical characteristics perhaps most critical for life's origins were pervasive cycling of environmental conditions at or near Earth's Hadean surface. Periodic cycles such as day-night, high tide-low tide, hot-cold, and wet-dry subjected prebiotic chemicals to repeated selective pressures and thus winnowed the pool of available chemical species. Episodic events, including asteroid impacts and volcanic eruptions, added additional selective pressures to the near-surface organic inventory

The article "Mineral Surfaces, Geochemical Complexities, and the Origins of Life" by Hazen and Sverjensky focuses primarily on the roles of mineral surfaces in the origins of life. While it doesn't explicitly mention the constant crashing of tides and erosion, there are connections to the idea of dynamic processes shaping the Earth's surface.
In the article, the authors highlight the mineral-water interface as a dynamic and energetic environment. This interface is where minerals interact with water and other fluids, and it provides opportunities for various molecular processes. The authors discuss how these interfaces can selectively adsorb biomolecules, promote chemical reactions, and facilitate the concentration and organization of molecules.
The constant crashing of tides and erosion can contribute to the dynamic nature of the mineral-water interface. As tides ebb and flow, they can cause physical forces that lead to the breaking up of mineral surfaces and the erosion of rocks. This process exposes fresh surfaces of minerals, providing more opportunities for interactions with water and organic molecules.
The erosion of mineral surfaces can also contribute to the creation of gradients and fluxes mentioned in the earlier aspects of the origins-of-life models. As minerals are eroded, they release dissolved ions and other components into the surrounding water, contributing to chemical gradients. Additionally, the movement of eroded materials through water currents and tides creates fluid fluxes that further distribute and mix organic molecules.
While the specific mention of tides and erosion may not be present in the article, the ideas presented about the dynamic nature of the mineral-water interface and its role in molecular processes align with the concept that constant crashing tides and erosion contribute to the shaping and evolution of Earth's surface.
