This is interesting, I thought of transient hypofrontality and psychological flow as synonyms:

entered an altered state called ���transient hypofrontality��� (Dietrich, 2003), which is associated with reductions in pain, feelings of floating, feelings of peacefulness, feelings of living in the here and now and time distortions. In contrast, entered the altered state known as ���flow��� (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991), which is associated with focused attention, a loss of self-consciousness and optimal performance of a task.

ChatGPT
Transient hypofrontality and psychological flow are related concepts, but they aren't exactly the same. Here's a brief distinction between the two:
Transient Hypofrontality
: As described by Dietrich (2003), transient hypofrontality is a neurobiological concept. The term refers to the temporary downregulation of the brain's prefrontal cortex. This reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex can lead to sensations of reduced self-awareness, distortions in the perception of time, feelings of floating, and a decreased sense of pain. Some researchers suggest that activities like meditation, running, or even daydreaming can lead to transient hypofrontality.
Flow
: Introduced by Csikszentmihalyi (1991), flow refers to a psychological state where one is fully immersed in an activity, leading to heightened focus and optimal performance. During flow, there's a loss of self-consciousness and people often lose track of time. Activities that can induce flow vary for individuals but often include tasks that strike a balance between challenge and skill.
While both concepts involve altered states of consciousness, the primary difference lies in their focus. Transient hypofrontality is more about a specific neurological state, while flow is a broader psychological concept concerning optimal experience and engagement.
However, the two can overlap. For example, during intense physical or mental activities that induce flow, one might experience aspects of transient hypofrontality. Still, it's essential to recognize that they are distinct concepts with unique features.

Transient-Hypofrontality

Psychological flow

If I have a thought, I can put it right here.

Do I have any thoughts about the title of this repository?

Only that tran��sient /��tranSH��nt,��tranz����nt/ Learn to pronounce adjective lasting only for a short time; impermanent. "a transient cold spell" noun 1. a person who is staying or working in a place for only a short time. 2. a momentary variation in current, voltage, or frequency.

And that

Hypofrontality

Hypofrontality is a state of decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Hypofrontality is symptomatic of several neurological medical conditions, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. This condition was initially described by Ingvar and Franz��n in 1974, through the use of xenon blood flow technique with 32 detectors to image the brains of patients with schizophrenia.

This finding was confirmed in subsequent studies using the improved spatial resolution of positron emission tomography with the fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) tracer. Subsequent neuroimaging work has shown that the decreases in prefrontal CBF are localized to the medial, lateral, and orbital portions of the prefrontal cortex. Hypofrontality is thought to contribute to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia

And that

In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time.

It appears that you've shared a snippet of a GitHub repository page related to "Transient-Hypofrontality." The repository discusses the concepts of transient hypofrontality and psychological flow, both of which we've just touched upon.
From the content:
The repository's README provides definitions and insights into both transient hypofrontality and flow. The definition of transient as an adjective and noun is also given, emphasizing its temporary or momentary nature.
"Hypofrontality" is detailed as a state of decreased cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex. This condition is linked to several neurological disorders like schizophrenia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. The origin of understanding this condition is traced back to Ingvar and Franz��n's work in 1974. This finding was further validated in later studies, which pinpointed the decreased blood flow to specific areas of the prefrontal cortex. The condition's association with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is also mentioned.
"Flow" in positive psychology is defined as a mental state where an individual is deeply engrossed in an activity, leading to heightened focus, full involvement, and pleasure in the process. It's when someone feels "in the zone" and experiences a distortion in their sense of time.
The repository provides links to Wikipedia for both concepts for those interested in further reading.
If you have any questions or would like to discuss these concepts further, please let me know!

Ok I need a more simplified breakdown

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's simplify:
Transient Hypofrontality
:
It's a temporary state where there's reduced activity in the brain's prefrontal cortex.
This state can lead to feelings like floating, peace, and distortions in time perception.
This condition is seen in several disorders like schizophrenia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, etc.
Flow
:
It's a mental state where you're fully involved and enjoying an activity.
When in flow, you're "in the zone", focused, and may lose track of time.
In short, transient hypofrontality involves decreased brain activity, while flow is about being deeply engaged in an activity.
1 / 1
Ok well I am thinking that when you engage in a familiar activity you can do it without having to engage a lot of reasoning due to automaticity of the processes, similarity to previous situations and iterative feedback, so you can engage with complex processes with simple monitoring scheme, this lowering the need for frontality. I am thinking of someone waterskiing while juggling and solving Rubik's cubes.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, your line of thinking aligns well with some theories about cognitive processing and expertise. When someone becomes highly skilled or familiar with a particular task, the cognitive demands often decrease due to a shift from controlled to automatic processing. Let's delve into your example:
Waterskiing while juggling and solving Rubik's cubes
:
Waterskiing
: As a person becomes experienced in waterskiing, the motor skills required become automatic, demanding less conscious attention and thought. The neural pathways associated with this activity become stronger and more efficient, allowing the person to perform the task with minimal effort.
Juggling
: Juggling requires motor coordination and rhythm. An expert juggler doesn't need to consciously think about each throw or catch; it becomes an automatic process.
Solving Rubik's cubes
: Expertise in solving Rubik's cubes can lead to pattern recognition and automatic responses to certain configurations. Instead of methodically thinking through each move, experts may rely on muscle memory and intuition.
Engaging in all three simultaneously might look like a display of multitasking, but in reality, it���s more about the balance of controlled and automatic processing. As each task becomes more familiar, the prefrontal cortex (associated with reasoning, planning, and decision-making) might be less involved since the processes become automatic, leading to a kind of "transient hypofrontality". The person can monitor and engage in these activities without the need for intense frontal brain engagement.
In essence, through extensive practice and repetition, complex tasks can be broken down into simpler, more manageable chunks that require less active cognitive processing, allowing for such impressive multitasking feats.

Abstract
Recent theoretical and empirical work in cognitive science and neuroscience is brought into contact with the concept of the flow experience. After a brief exposition of brain function, the explicit-implicit distinction is applied to the effortless information processing that is so characteristic of the flow state. The explicit system is associated with the higher cognitive functions of the frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe structures and has evolved to increase cognitive flexibility. In contrast, the implicit system is associated with the skill-based knowledge supported primarily by the basal ganglia and has the advantage of being more efficient. From the analysis of this flexibility/efficiency trade-off emerges a thesis that identifies the flow state as a period during which a highly practiced skill that is represented in the implicit system's knowledge base is implemented without interference from the explicit system. It is proposed that a necessary prerequisite to the experience of flow is a state of transient hypofrontality that enables the temporary suppression of the analytical and meta-conscious capacities of the explicit system. Examining sensory-motor integration skills that seem to typify flow such as athletic performance, writing, and free-jazz improvisation, the new framework clarifies how this concept relates to creativity and opens new avenues of research.

Based on the abstract you provided from the paper titled "Neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the experience of flow" by Arne Dietrich (2004), here's a simplified breakdown:
Main Idea
: The paper aims to understand the "flow" state (a deeply immersive and enjoyable experience during an activity) from a neurocognitive perspective.
Brain Function
: The study delves into the workings of the brain, especially focusing on the difference between explicit and implicit systems.
Explicit System
: Associated with higher cognitive functions (like reasoning) primarily located in the frontal lobe. It's more flexible but less efficient.
Implicit System
: Linked to skills and habits, mainly supported by the basal ganglia. It's more efficient but less flexible.
Flow and the Two Systems
: The flow state is proposed to be a time when a well-practiced skill (stored in the implicit system) is executed without the interference of the explicit system.
Transient Hypofrontality
: A state where there's reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, associated with reasoning and conscious thought. This state is believed to be a prerequisite for the flow experience. It essentially suppresses overthinking and analytical capacities, allowing the person to be fully immersed in the activity.
Applications
: The framework helps explain why certain activities, like sports, writing, or improvisational music, often lead to the flow state. It also sheds light on how flow relates to creativity.
This paper suggests that achieving a flow state is not just about the task at hand, but also how the brain manages the information processing for that task. The flow state might occur when our well-practiced skills (housed in the efficient implicit system) can operate without interruption from the more analytical explicit system.

Your Brain Performs Better When It Slows Down, with Steven Kotler
Best-selling author Steven Kotler discusses hypofrontality -- literally the slowing of the brain's prefrontal cortex -- and how it allows one to enter an optimal state of consciousness, known as flow. As Kotler explains, flow refers to those moments of total absorption when we get so focused on the task at hand that everything else disappears

Best-selling author Steven Kotler recently visited Big Think to discuss the optimization of consciousness through flow states, a key topic in his recently published book, The Rise of Superman. The best way to describe a flow state is to use the example of practically every action movie released since The Matrix. Experiencing flow is similar to being in ���bullet time.��� Like Keanu Reeves��� Neo (though certainly not on his level), a person in flow obtains the ability to keenly hone their focus on the task at hand so that everything else disappears.

Kotler describes it like this:

���So our sense of self, our sense of self-consciousness, they vanish. Time dilates which means sometimes it slows down. You get that freeze frame effect familiar to any of you who have seen The Matrix or been in a car crash. Sometimes it speeds up and five hours will pass by in like five minutes. And throughout all aspects of performance, mental and physical, go through the roof.���

While this may sound like sci-fi hocus pocus, Kotler explains that beneath a flow state lies ���a complicated mass of neurobiology.��� There���s a common myth that humans only use about 10% of their brains. If we were to assume this (and we wouldn���t, because it���s bogus), an optimal performance would then mean the brain works harder and faster to achieve 100% efficiency. As Kotler explains, the 10% myth has it all backwards:

���In flow, parts of the brain aren���t becoming more hyperactive, they���re actually slowing down, shutting down. The technical term for this is transient, meaning temporary, hypo frontality. Hypo ��� H ��� Y ��� P ��� O ��� it���s the opposite of hyper means to slow down, to shut down, to deactivate. And frontality is the prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain that houses your higher cognitive functions, your sense of morality, your sense of will, your sense of self.���

The prefrontal cortex also calculates time. When we experience transient hypofrontality, we lose the ability to assess past, present, and future. As Kotler explains it, ���we���re plunged into what researchers call the deep now.���

TOP STORIES
So what causes transient hypofrontality? It was once assumed that flow states are an affliction reserved only for schizophrenics and drug addicts, but in the early 2000s a researcher named Aaron Dietrich realized that transient hypofrontality underpins every altered state ��� from dreaming to mindfulness to psychedelic trips and everything inbetween. Sometimes these altered states involve other parts of the brain shutting down. For example, when the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disconnects, your sense of self-doubt and the brain���s inner critic get silenced. This results in boosted states of confidence and creativity.

Kotler describes it as his mission over the past 15 years to reclaim the study of flow states from ���the hippie community��� and place it back within the gaze of hard science. While researchers have been studying flow for over 140 years, recent advances in brain imaging technology have led to significant neuroscientific revelations and should lead to many more. Whether or not we���ll be able to develop a ���Neo switch��� so that bullet time can be all the time��� well, I suppose it depends on just how far the rabbit hole goes.

Steven Kotler, a best-selling author, delves into the concept of flow states and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms in this article from "Big Think". Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Flow States
: This is an optimal state of consciousness where one is completely absorbed in an activity, leading to heightened performance and focus. The experience is like being in ���bullet time��� from movies like "The Matrix", where everything slows down, allowing for intense concentration and acute responsiveness.
How Flow Feels
: During flow, one's sense of self and self-consciousness vanish. Time perception is distorted; sometimes it feels elongated and at other times it feels like it's passing rapidly. Both mental and physical performances are greatly enhanced.
Neurobiology of Flow
: Contrary to the myth that humans use only 10% of their brain, and that achieving optimal performance would require the brain to work harder, flow states are characterized by certain parts of the brain slowing down or even shutting off. This phenomenon is referred to as
Transient Hypofrontality
. "Transient" means temporary, "hypo" means reduction or decrease, and "frontality" refers to the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions, sense of self, morality, and time perception.
Loss of Time Perception
: The prefrontal cortex also plays a role in how we perceive time. When this region slows down or shuts off (during transient hypofrontality), our perception of time is altered, leading us to experience the "deep now", a state where we're intensely present in the moment without a sense of past or future.
Cause of Transient Hypofrontality
: It was earlier believed that flow states were exclusive to conditions like schizophrenia or substance abuse. However, research by Aaron Dietrich in the early 2000s revealed that transient hypofrontality is common to various altered states of consciousness - from dreaming to mindfulness to psychedelic experiences. In some of these states, other parts of the brain, like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, might shut down, leading to a decrease in self-doubt and an increase in confidence and creativity.
Kotler's Mission
: Kotler has aimed to shift the study of flow states from fringe or "hippie" perceptions and root it firmly in scientific research. With advancements in brain imaging technology, our understanding of flow and its neurological underpinnings has grown significantly.
Future of Flow Research
: There's anticipation and curiosity about where this research will lead, especially with the potential promise of being able to intentionally induce flow states.
For those interested in diving deeper, the article provides a link to Steven Kotler's Big Think interview, which further discusses flow states and transient hypofrontality.

Do you think that you can articulate the thesis that the brain can deal with familar tasks easier because they require less thought, even though they seem more complex, due to black box abstraction, encapsulating of the individual functioning of agents. I also argue, like in surfaces and essences, that analogies and metaphors, as well as counterfactual and counterfoliate worlds play an essential role in this process.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an attempt to articulate that thesis:
The human brain possesses a remarkable ability to manage familiar tasks with apparent ease, even when these tasks may outwardly seem intricate or complex. This efficiency is attributed to a process akin to "black box abstraction", where the detailed operations or mechanics of a task are abstracted away, and the brain simply processes the task as a single unit, much like how a black box would receive inputs and produce outputs without the need to consciously consider the inner workings each time. This is analogous to the encapsulation of functions in complex systems, where individual agents or components operate autonomously, and their detailed operations are hidden from the broader system.
A significant facilitator in this abstraction process is the brain's use of analogies and metaphors. As posited in "Surfaces and Essences", analogies allow the brain to map unfamiliar concepts onto familiar ones, simplifying the cognitive load by drawing parallels between the known and the unknown. Metaphors, being linguistic expressions of analogies, further bolster this mapping by offering a linguistic bridge between abstract concepts and tangible experiences.
Moreover, the brain's capacity to envision counterfactual and counterfoliate worlds ��� scenarios or realities that diverge from the known ��� further aids in the processing of tasks. These imaginative constructs allow the brain to anticipate outcomes, simulate scenarios, and make predictions, thereby refining its approach to tasks based on both real and imagined experiences.
In essence, through the combined processes of black box abstraction, the use of analogies and metaphors, and the envisioning of alternate realities, the brain adeptly manages to simplify and efficiently handle tasks that, on the surface, may seem dauntingly complex.
This thesis combines the principles you've mentioned to argue that the brain has evolved various mechanisms and cognitive strategies to efficiently handle tasks by leveraging both its capacity for abstraction and its ability to draw upon both real and imagined experiences.
1 / 1
Counterfoliate worlds is based on Counterfoil choice is a decision-making concept used in the Kalabari culture as a way to maintain their cultural identity and way of life while minimizing the influence of outside forces. It involves presenting two options, but only one of them is the preferred choice, while the other is only presented as a contrast or counterfoil.  Like the obviously wrong or decoy options in a multiple-choice question.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, understood. My apologies for the oversight. Let's revise the thesis with this corrected understanding:
The human brain possesses a remarkable ability to manage familiar tasks with efficiency, even when these tasks may outwardly appear intricate. This proficiency is partially rooted in a process similar to "black box abstraction", where detailed operations of a task are abstracted and the brain processes the task as a singular unit, analogous to the encapsulation of functions in complex systems.
Aiding this process is the brain's reliance on analogies and metaphors. As delineated in "Surfaces and Essences", analogies enable the brain to superimpose unfamiliar concepts onto familiar ones, reducing the cognitive load. Metaphors serve as linguistic bridges between abstract ideas and tangible experiences, reinforcing this mapping.
Furthermore, the brain's capacity to entertain counterfactual worlds ��� alternate scenarios or realities ��� enhances its ability to approach tasks. These imagined constructs allow for outcome anticipation, scenario simulation, and prediction. The concept of "Counterfoil choice", reminiscent of the Kalabari cultural practice, also plays a role here. By juxtaposing a preferred option with a decoy or obviously incorrect one, the brain can swiftly and efficiently make decisions by using the decoy as a point of contrast, streamlining the decision-making process.
In conclusion, through mechanisms like black box abstraction, the use of analogies and metaphors, the envisioning of alternate realities, and the application of counterfoil choices, the brain simplifies and adeptly tackles tasks that might initially seem complex.
This revised thesis integrates the principles you've detailed, emphasizing the brain's strategies and mechanisms to efficiently process and decide on tasks.

Connections with the previous topics.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's draw connections between the topics we've discussed:
Flow vs. Transient Hypofrontality
:
Both refer to states of optimized cognitive functioning where certain parts of the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, are less active or "quieter."
Flow represents a state of total immersion and peak performance, often seen in artists, athletes, and other professionals.
Transient hypofrontality describes the slowing down or temporary deactivation of the prefrontal cortex, which results in a sense of time distortion, loss of self-consciousness, and increased performance in flow states.
Familiar Tasks & Effortless Processing
:
When tasks become familiar, they're processed in the implicit system, which is more efficient. Such tasks don't require as much active thought or engagement of the explicit, analytical system.
This ties in with the concept of transient hypofrontality. Familiar tasks could lead to a state where the brain isn't actively overthinking or analyzing, thereby facilitating a flow state.
Black Box Abstraction & Encapsulation
:
Black box abstraction relates to understanding a system by its inputs and outputs without needing to know its internal mechanisms. In cognitive terms, when we're familiar with a task, we don't need to consciously think about every step.
This "black-boxing" allows for faster, more efficient processing, which can lead to or facilitate flow states.
Analogies, Metaphors, and Counterfactual Worlds
:
Analogies and metaphors help us understand new or unfamiliar concepts by relating them to known concepts. This can potentially simplify complex tasks and make them feel more familiar, leading to a state of flow.
Counterfactual worlds, where we imagine "what could have been," and the concept of counterfoil choices (from the Kalabari culture), both play into decision-making processes. In the context of our discussion, these concepts touch on how our brains handle decisions, potential outcomes, and familiar vs. unfamiliar scenarios.
Quantum Bayesianism & "Quiet Brainscan"
:
Quantum Bayesianism (QBism) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that emphasizes personal belief or Bayesian inference. The link to "Quiet Brainscan" is primarily in their shared initials, but there's a deeper connection in the idea of internal perceptions or beliefs influencing external realities, much like the internal state of the brain influencing cognitive performance.
In essence, the entire conversation revolves around the brain's mechanisms for optimizing performance, whether through familiarity, abstraction, decision-making constructs, or altered states of consciousness.

I was thinking about how bees might remember how much energy it took to fly somewhere or the amount of work.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing thought! Bees, like many other insects, have complex behaviors and exhibit signs of memory and learning despite their small brains. Here's how this could relate to energy expenditure and memory:
Energy Expenditure & Foraging Patterns
:
For bees, energy is primarily derived from nectar. When a bee discovers a rich source of nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a "waggle dance" to communicate the location of the nectar source to other bees. The duration and vigor of this dance can indicate the quality of the source, which might indirectly signify the energy expended or gained.
Spatial Memory
:
Bees exhibit impressive spatial memory, remembering landmarks and paths to and from their hive. They optimize their routes based on learned experiences. Over time, this could mean that bees develop a sense of which routes or foraging areas require more or less energy.
Learning & Adaptation
:
Bees can learn and adapt to their environment. If a particular foraging expedition required a significant amount of energy (due to distance, adverse wind conditions, etc.) without a satisfactory reward (insufficient nectar), the bee might be less inclined to revisit that location, favoring more energy-efficient sources.
Trade-off between Energy and Reward
:
In nature, there's often a balance between energy expenditure and the reward gained. If a bee consistently finds that a particular location requires too much energy for too little nectar, it might prioritize other locations. This decision-making process is a manifestation of the bee's memory and learning capabilities.
While it's unlikely that bees have a conscious memory of "how tiring" a trip was in the way humans might remember a strenuous workout, they do seem to integrate information about the value of resources and the energy required to obtain them. Over time, these experiences shape their foraging patterns and preferences.

I think it is analogous to the expectation in scientific reasoning that explanations be parsimonious.

Absolutely! The principle of parsimony, often referred to as Occam's Razor, suggests that given multiple explanations for an observed phenomenon, the simplest one (i.e., the one that makes the fewest assumptions) is usually the best. The idea is to favor the explanation that requires the least amount of speculative leaps.
In the context of bees and their energy expenditure:

: Just as parsimony values simplicity in explanations, bees value efficiency in their foraging patterns. They will likely favor paths and sources that provide the most nectar for the least amount of energy. It's a simple, direct way of maximizing reward while minimizing effort.
Memory and Learning Patterns
: Over time, through iterative feedback, bees refine their foraging paths. They drop paths that are inefficient or no longer rewarding. This is similar to how scientists refine theories over time, discarding elements that are superfluous or unsupported by evidence.
Economy of Effort
: Both parsimonious scientific reasoning and bee foraging behavior emphasize an economy of effort. In science, unnecessary complexity can obfuscate the truth. In nature, unnecessary complexity can waste valuable energy and resources.
Decision Making Based on Evidence
: Just as scientists weigh evidence to decide which theory is most likely correct, bees weigh the evidence (in terms of nectar quantity and quality) to decide which foraging paths are worth pursuing.
Drawing an analogy between the natural behaviors of organisms like bees and human-made principles like parsimony can shed light on how efficiency and simplicity are favored across different domains, from the natural world to intellectual pursuits.

I also call it Bayesian reasoning with sparse recursion.

ChatGPT
"Bayesian reasoning with sparse recursion" is a fascinating way to conceptualize both the parsimony principle and bee foraging behaviors. Let's break this down:
Bayesian Reasoning
: This refers to a method of probability interpretation in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In simpler terms, it's about refining beliefs based on new data. Bees, in their foraging, are constantly updating their "beliefs" about where the best nectar sources are based on their most recent experiences and the shared experiences of other bees.
Sparse Recursion
: Recursion in computational terms refers to a process calling upon itself. In a broader sense, recursion can refer to iterative or repetitive processes. "Sparse" recursion would suggest an iterative process that is efficient, streamlined, or reduced in complexity. It's about going through the necessary loops but not wasting time or energy on unnecessary repetitions. When bees refine their paths, they're undergoing an iterative process of finding the best sources of nectar, but they aim to do it with the least amount of repetitive, unnecessary journeys.
Drawing it all together, bees might be seen as employing a kind of "Bayesian reasoning with sparse recursion" in their behaviors. They update their understanding of the environment based on new data (like Bayesian updating) and undergo a process of refining their paths, but in the most efficient way possible (sparse recursion). This mirrors the principle of parsimony in scientific reasoning, where the simplest, most straightforward explanation is favored, much like bees favor the most direct, rewarding paths when foraging.

Ten Lessons We Have Learned in the New "Sparseland": A Short Handbook for Sparse Neural Network Researchers
Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang
This article does not propose any novel algorithm or new hardware for sparsity. Instead, it aims to serve the "common good" for the increasingly prosperous Sparse Neural Network (SNN) research community. We attempt to summarize some most common confusions in SNNs, that one may come across in various scenarios such as paper review/rebuttal and talks - many drawn from the authors' own bittersweet experiences! We feel that doing so is meaningful and timely, since the focus of SNN research is notably shifting from traditional pruning to more diverse and profound forms of sparsity before, during, and after training. The intricate relationships between their scopes, assumptions, and approaches lead to misunderstandings, for non-experts or even experts in SNNs. In response, we summarize ten Q\&As of SNNs from many key aspects, including dense vs. sparse, unstructured sparse vs. structured sparse, pruning vs. sparse training, dense-to-sparse training vs. sparse-to-sparse training, static sparsity vs. dynamic sparsity, before-training/during-training vs. post-training sparsity, and many more. We strive to provide proper and generically applicable answers to clarify those confusions to the best extent possible. We hope our summary provides useful general knowledge for people who want to enter and engage with this exciting community; and also provides some "mind of ease" convenience for SNN researchers to explain their work in the right contexts. At the very least (and perhaps as this article's most insignificant target functionality), if you are writing/planning to write a paper or rebuttal in the field of SNNs, we hope some of our answers could help you!

1. Background on Sparsity in Neural Networks 
Sparsity, one of the longest-standing concepts in machine learning, was introduced to 
the neural network i eld as early as in the 1980s (Mozer & Smolensky 1989; Janowsky 
1989; LeCun et al. 1990). It was picked up again for ���modern��� deep networks in the 
late 2010s, i rst under the name of Pruning, with the primary goal to reduce inference 
costs (Han et al. 2015a; Wen et al. 2016; Molchanov et al. 2016; Gale et al. 2019; Zhang 
et al. 2021, 2022). In a few years, the research interest in sparsity was signif i cantly 
revamped, owing to the proposal of Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) (Frankle & 
Carbin 2019), which revisits iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) (Han et al. 2015b) and 
discovers that the sparse subnetworks from IMP can match the full performance of the 
dense network when trained in isolation using original initializations. LTH has since been 
empowered by weight/learning rate rewinding (Frankle et al. 2020; Renda et al. 2020), 
and the existence of LTH has been verif i ed in various applications, showing the almost 
universal intrinsic sparsity in overparameterized networks (Chen et al. 2020, 2021c,b). 
A large body of work has meanwhile emerged to pursue ef i cient training as the i nancial

and environmental costs of model training grow exponentially (Strubell et al. 2019; 
Patterson et al. 2021). Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) (Mocanu et al. 2018; Liu et al. 
2021b; Evci et al. 2020a), stands out and receives upsurging interest due to its promise 
in saving both training and inference phases. Distinguished from the conventional pre- 
training and pruning, DST starts from a randomly initialized sparse neural network and 
dynamically adjusts the sparse topology in one training run without the need for pre- 
training, while maintaining moderate training costs by, for example, keeping the same 
sparsity ratios across all varying masks (Jayakumar et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2021a). The 
key crux of DST, ���sparse-to-sparse���, should be contrasted with the more ���old-fashioned��� 
training that gradually sparsif i es a dense model (Lym et al. 2019; You et al. 2020)- 
referred to as ���dense-to-sparse��� in this article. One should point out the recent ideas of 
���pathway��� (Barham et al. 2022) or ���mixture of experts��� (MoEs) essentially instantiate 
DST too (Shazeer et al. 2017; Riquelme et al. 2021; Chowdhery et al. 2022). 
As a naive special case of DST, Static Sparse Training (SST) (Mocanu et al. 
2016; Evci et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2022b; Dao et al. 2022) sticks to a i xed sparse pattern 
throughout training and the sparse pattern needs to be pre-chosen before training. This 
is tantalizing too, since to date dynamic sparse masks during training lack practical 
hardware system support. LTH could be considered as a sibling to this category: although 
LTH utilizes costly pre-training and iterative pruning to discover ���winning��� sparse masks, 
the main contribution it delivers is an ���existence proof��� of sparse and independently 
trainable subnetworks although the construction using IMP compromises the ef i ciency 
gain. As perhaps the most important subgroup of work underlying Static Sparse Training, 
Pruning at Initialization (PaI) (Lee et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2020; Tanaka et al. 2020) 
seeks to prune weights before training based on a class of gradient-based synaptic saliency 
scores so that training over the remaining sparse weights can be more ef i cient. 
While categorized as dif f erent sparse algorithms, LTH, DST, and PaI actually share 
many similar l avors and approaches, i.e., i nding sparse neural networks that can be 
independently trained to match the dense ones��� performance, hence replacing the latter. 
However, the shift of interest from conventional pruning to the emerging ���sparseland��� 
(including but not limited to LTH, DST, and PaI) only occurred in the last few years, and 
the relationships among dif f erent sparse algorithms in terms of scopes, assumptions, and 
approaches are highly intricate and sometimes ambiguous, which together cause many 
misunderstandings for non-experts or even experts. Readers may refer to an excellent 
survey article (Hoef l er et al. 2021) for a more comprehensive picture.

Certainly! Here's a condensed overview of the provided text regarding Sparsity in Neural Networks:
A Brief Overview of Sparsity in Neural Networks
Historical Context
: Sparsity in neural networks isn't a recent concept. It dates back to the 1980s but gained traction again in the late 2010s with the rise of deep learning.
Pruning and Modern Networks
: One of the first applications in modern networks was to prune them, reducing the inference costs. This approach underwent a revival, especially with the introduction of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). The LTH postulates that sparse subnetworks can achieve the same performance as dense networks if trained with the original initializations.
Dynamic Sparse Training (DST)
: DST is a recent and significant development. Unlike traditional approaches which start with dense networks and then prune them (dense-to-sparse), DST begins with a sparse model and adjusts the sparsity during the training. This method doesn't require pre-training, making it efficient. Related concepts include the "pathway" and "mixture of experts" which are in essence variations of DST.
Static Sparse Training (SST)
: An offshoot of DST, SST retains a static sparse structure throughout the training process. While this has the advantage of being straightforward, it lacks the dynamism that DST offers. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis can be seen as a variation of this, offering evidence of the potential of sparse subnetworks.
Pruning at Initialization (PaI)
: This approach involves pruning the network before training begins. It bases its pruning decisions on synaptic saliency scores. The goal is to make training on the remaining sparse weights more efficient.
Emergence of "Sparseland"
: The recent surge of interest in sparsity, covering approaches like LTH, DST, and PaI, represents a shift from traditional methods. These newer techniques all aim to find sparse networks that can match or even surpass the performance of dense ones.
Existing Complexity
: As the field of sparsity in neural networks grows, so does its complexity. Various sparse algorithms have emerged, and the relationships among them are intricate, leading to confusions even among experts in the field.
This summary encapsulates the main points in the provided text on sparsity in neural networks, giving a brief overview of its evolution and current state.

Alright, let's simplify it further:
Sparsity in Neural Networks: A Simplified Overview
What's Old is New
: The idea of using fewer parts of neural networks (sparsity) has been around since the 1980s. Recently, it's become popular again as we look for ways to make these networks faster and more efficient.
Why Sparsity?
: The big idea is to trim away parts of the network that aren't needed (called pruning). This makes the network lighter without losing much accuracy.
The Lottery Ticket Idea
: A recent idea, called the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, suggests that small parts of a large network can work just as well as the whole thing if trained right.
Different Ways to Use Sparsity
:
Dynamic Sparse Training
: Starts with a trimmed network and tweaks it as it learns.
Static Sparse Training
: Keeps the network's trimmed structure fixed throughout learning.
Pruning at Start
: Trims the network before it even begins learning based on importance scores.
Growing Complexity
: As more researchers jump into studying sparsity, there's a lot of new methods and ideas coming out. This can be confusing, even for experts.
Hopefully, this version provides a clearer and less technical overview of the topic.

2. Overview of Sparse Neural Networks as Emerging Research Field 
Seeing a new research community being rapidly formed (in part thanks to a few highly 
visible tutorials������ and well-attended workshops�����), we hereby use a unif i ed terminology, 
Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs), to collectively refer to all research interests and 
activities on the topics of sparsity in deep networks, including but not limited to: 
��� Sparsity in deep network weights, activations, inputs, or gradients 
��� Sparsity before, during, or after training 
��� Sparsity with or without statistical and/or structural group patterns 
��� Sparsity with constant or input-dynamic masks

Ten Lessons We Have Learned in the New ���Sparseland���3 
The research i eld of SNNs is incredibly deep and broad. We envision a (non-exhaustive 
and incomplete) list of important research questions in the SNN i eld to encapsulate: 
��� Algorithm foundations of SNNs, including 
��� weight sparsity, including classical pruning, LTH, PaI, DST/MoEs, and others 
��� activation and gradient sparsity, which are commonly explored in ef i cient training, 
transfer learning or distributed training algorithms 
��� input data sparsity such as coreset selection, and in non-Euclidean domains such as 
graph sub-sampling 
��� Learning theory foundations, rigorously relating sparsity to neural network repre- 
sentation, architecture, optimization, or generalization 
��� Hardware and system foundations, supporting SNN training and inference algo- 
rithm execution in the edge, the cloud, or the distributed network 
��� Theoretical neuroscience foundations of SNNs that call for more cross-disciplinary 
collaborations (Ma et al. 2022) 
Most questions addressed in this article would focus on the SNN algorithm foundations. 
We should point out that due to historic research trends & convention, an SNN (in most 
available papers nowadays) by default refers to a deep network with weight sparsity (e.g., 
most of its connection weights being zero- regardless of structured versus unstructured, 
static versus dynamic). To be aligned with literature norms, this article may by default 
use ���SNN��� to interchangeably refer to sparse-weight networks too. We do hope the scope 
of SNNs continues to grow and the terminology will be quickly enriched and evolved. 
In the following, we collect a series of the most typical confusions about SNNs and 
provide proper answers to address/clarify them, in the hope of providing useful general 
knowledge for the non-expert audiences who want to enter and engage with the SNN 
community, as well as for the expert audience to better explain their work during a 
variety of scenarios. At the very least (and perhaps as this article���s most insignif i cant 
target functionality), if you are writing/planning to write a paper or rebuttal in the fi eld 
of SNNs, we hope some of our answers could help you!

3. Common Confusions in SNNs: Start from Ten Q&As 
3.1. Why bother sparse neural networks, not just dense compact networks? 
(Commonly appearing in reviewer comments like: ���Why don���t just use a smaller dense 
model, but rather (like an idiot) i rst start from a bigger model and then sparsifying it?���) 
It is well-known that the performance of deep neural networks scales as a power law 
w.r.t. model capacity and training data size (Hestness et al. 2017; Kaplan et al. 2020). 
However, the memory and computation required to train and deploy these large models 
also explode (Garc��a-Mart��n et al. 2019; Patterson et al. 2021). Sparse NNs keep the same 
model architectures with those dense large models, but only activate a small fraction of 
weights. Since state-of-the-art sparse NNs can match the utility performance of their 
dense counterparts (through either pruning or DST/PaI), sparsity can potentially be a 
free lunch to make training/inference cheaper while performing the same well. 
For the sake of convenience, let us call the source (dense) deep network ���large dense���, 
and the SNN generated by sparsifying ���large dense��� weights as ���large sparse���. In general: 
��� ���Large sparse��� should ��� ���large dense��� in terms of parameter counts. Meanwhile, ���large 
sparse��� should ��� ���large dense��� in terms of the utility performance such as accuracy. 
4Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang 
Meanwhile, since we steadily gain performance of the target utility by scaling up model 
sizes appropriately, then if we construct another down-scaled dense model whose param- 
eter count ��� ���large sparse���, and call it ���small dense���, then we should expect that: 
��� The performance of ���small dense��� ��� ���large dense���, and hence ��� ���large sparse��� too. 
Hence, given the same parameter count, ideally, it is always preferable to choose ���large 
sparse��� since it is more performant than ���small dense��� while more ef i cient than ���large 
dense���. The assumed benef i ts of ���large sparse��� models over ���small dense��� have been widely 
observed in various SNN scenarios including neural network pruning (Li et al. 2020), 
dynamic sparse training (Evci et al. 2020a), and static sparse training (Liu et al. 2022b).
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Alright, let's break this down:
Common Confusions in SNNs: Starting with Ten Q&As
Q: Why are sparse neural networks important when we could just use smaller, dense networks?
Answer:
Performance Scaling
: The effectiveness of deep neural networks increases with model capacity and training data size. But as these networks grow, the computational costs and memory requirements also shoot up significantly.
Sparse NNs Save Resources
: Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) maintain the architecture of large, dense models but only use a fraction of the weights. State-of-the-art SNNs can perform just as well as their dense counterparts (through methods like pruning or DST/PaI), but at a fraction of the computational cost. This makes SNNs an economically viable choice for training and inference.
Comparison in Performance and Efficiency
:
A large sparse neural network has way fewer parameters than its dense counterpart but performs nearly as well in tasks like accuracy.
If you take a dense network that has roughly the same parameter count as a large sparse network (let's call it a small dense model), its performance will be significantly worse than both the large dense and the large sparse networks.
Therefore, for the same number of parameters, a large sparse network is always a better choice. It performs better than a small dense model and is more efficient than a large dense one.
Empirical Evidence
: This preference for large sparse models over small dense ones is supported by observations in various SNN contexts, including neural network pruning, dynamic sparse training, and static sparse training.
In essence, the benefits of sparse neural networks aren't just theoretical. In practice, they can deliver the same performance as larger dense networks but at a fraction of the computational cost. This makes them a more efficient and economical choice for many machine learning applications.

3.2. What is the dif f erence between unstructured and structured weight pruning? What 
is the dif f erence between weight pruning and activation pruning? 
Unstructured pruning, as the most elementary pruning form, eliminates the least im- 
portant weights based on the selected criteria, regardless of where they are. Unstructured 
pruning leads to irregular sparse patterns, which typically only see limited speedups on 
commodity hardware such as GPUs. On the other hand, structured pruning involves 
the selective removal of an entire group of weights. The def i nition of ���group���, which 
makes those amenable to hardware speedup, could refer to weight blocks (Gray et al. 
2017; Ding et al. 2017), neurons (Jiang et al. 2018), i lters/channels (Li et al. 2016), 
attention heads (Voita et al. 2019)), or other dedicated i ne-grained sparse patterns (such 
as N:M sparsity (nvi 2020; Zhou et al. 2021), block-diagonal sparsity (Dao et al. 2022), 
or compiler-aware patterns (Ma et al. 2020)). 
Activation pruning has lots of overlap with structured weight pruning in terms of 
their outcomes: completely removing certain intermediate feature outputs. For example, 
structural pruning by neurons in MLP layers, channels/f i lters in convolutional layers, 
or heads in self-attention layers naturally yield activation pruning. However, one shall 
notice that those are still two separate streams of research and their overlap is only partial 
because: (1) on one hand, some structured weight pruning methods do not lead to any 
reduction of output dimension. For example, applying N:M sparsity to convolutional 
layers will change neither the output channel number nor the feature map size; (2) On 
the other hand, some activation pruning methods do not come from removing weight: a 
few methods sparsify activations after computing them fully (with full unpruned weights) 
(Ardakani et al. 2017; Chakrabarti & Moseley 2019; Jiang et al. 2022b), and that often 
happens when saving memory, instead of computation or latency, is the main focus.

ChatGPT
Let's summarize the given information:
Differences between various pruning methods in Neural Networks:
1. Unstructured vs. Structured Weight Pruning:
Unstructured Pruning
:
Removes individual weights deemed least important based on certain criteria.
Results in irregular sparse patterns in the network.
These patterns don't easily translate to computational speedups on standard hardware like GPUs because the sparsity is scattered.
Structured Pruning
:
Removes entire groups of weights at once.
The term 'group' can refer to:
Weight blocks
Neurons
Filters or channels in a CNN
Attention heads in transformer models
Specific fine-grained patterns like N:M sparsity, block-diagonal sparsity, or patterns that are compiler-aware.
Leads to more regular and predictable patterns of sparsity, which can be optimized for on hardware.
2. Weight Pruning vs. Activation Pruning:
Weight Pruning
:
Focuses on eliminating certain weights or groups of weights from the network.
Activation Pruning
:
Focuses on removing specific intermediate feature outputs, essentially zeroing out certain activations.
Has overlap with structured weight pruning because removing certain weights (like entire neurons or filters) naturally leads to eliminating corresponding activations.
Important Differences
:
Not all structured weight pruning methods result in activation pruning. For example, N:M sparsity on convolutional layers doesn't alter the output dimensions or feature map sizes.
Some activation pruning methods don't arise from weight removal. Some methods compute full activations (without weight pruning) and then sparsify the activations. This is often done when the primary objective is to save memory rather than reduce computation or latency.
In essence, while weight pruning and activation pruning are related concepts, they tackle sparsity from different angles. Weight pruning focuses on the connections (weights) in the network, while activation pruning focuses on the outputs of those connections.

3.3. Is structured pruning just channel pruning? Is channel pruning the only ���practical 
meaningful��� sparse structure on hardware? 
No, structured pruning is way more than just channel pruning- it encompasses various 
more types of sparse patterns like block-wise, neuron-wise, channel/f i lter-wise, and i ne- 
grained sparsity (see above). Channel/f i lter pruning results in a sparse pattern that 
is equivalent to a small dense network, that can be straightforwardly accelerated on 
commodity hardware and platforms. Nevertheless, other forms of structured sparsity 
(e.g., block-wise, vector-wise, N:M i ne-grained) tend to deliver better accuracy at higher 
levels of sparsity since their less restricted zero/nonzero weight positions. When combined 
with the specialized hardware (nvi 2020; Toon 2020) and libraries (Gray et al. 2017), these 
types often have stronger performance-speed trade-of f s compared to channel pruning. So, 
Ten Lessons We Have Learned in the New ���Sparseland���5 
the answer to which sparsity pattern is more practically meaningful really depends on 
the hardware customization and resource availability. 
3.4. Does weight pruning simply produce a smaller/narrower network? 
(Commonly appearing in reviewer comments like: ���It makes no dif f erence to specif i cally 
study a sparse network, because that is just a normal dense network in reduced width!���)

Alright, let's summarize the discussed topics:
Structured Pruning and its Practical Implications on Hardware:
3.3. Relationship between Structured Pruning and Channel Pruning:
Structured Pruning
:
More than just channel pruning.
Encompasses various sparse patterns like block-wise, neuron-wise, channel/filter-wise, and fine-grained sparsity.
Each method has its advantages depending on the specific application and the available hardware.
Channel/Filter Pruning
:
Yields a sparse pattern that is equivalent to a smaller dense network.
Can be straightforwardly accelerated on standard hardware platforms.
But other structured sparsity methods can offer better accuracy at higher sparsity levels because they are less restrictive in where weights can be zero or nonzero.
Optimal Sparsity Pattern
:
Depends on the specific hardware and available resources.
Different sparsity methods can be more or less effective based on hardware customizations and resources.
3.4. Does Weight Pruning Produce a Smaller/Narrower Network?
General Concept

I like to keep my wikipedia watchlist at 150,000 entries, so it doesn't overload the export mechanism. So if I add 150 or 1000 new entries I try to remove the same amount. I try to remove boring uninteresting offensive unnotable over-edited, controversial, or overly long titles. Depending on how much time I have available, how much the error is I can add or remove entries using different filters such as all titles containing that word.

Managing a large Wikipedia watchlist can be quite a task, especially if you aim to keep it at a specific threshold like 150,000 entries. Your strategy of maintaining the balance by adding and removing entries based on your criteria makes sense. Here are some general steps and tips to help streamline the process:
Automate the Process
: Consider scripting or automating the process. You can use Wikipedia's API to interact with your watchlist programmatically. This would allow you to quickly add, remove, or modify entries based on your set criteria.
Search Filters
: Utilize Wikipedia's advanced search features. When you need to remove entries, use filters to find articles containing specific words or phrases that align with your criteria. For instance, if you wish to remove controversial topics, you might search for words like "controversy," "debate," "criticism," etc.
Check Edit Frequency
: For articles that are over-edited, look at their edit history. Those with very frequent edits can be removed if you feel they're generating too much noise.
Content Length
: Wikipedia's API can provide information about an article's size. You can use this data to filter out overly long articles.
Automated Suggestions
: Use bots or scripts to suggest articles that might be uninteresting, non-noteworthy, or offensive. While these won't be perfect, they can help speed up the process.
Regular Maintenance
: Allocate a specific time, maybe once a week or once a month, to manage your watchlist. Regular maintenance can prevent the list from becoming unmanageable.
Community Input
: Since Wikipedia is community-driven, consider joining forums or discussion groups related to Wikipedia editing. Other users might have created tools, scripts, or strategies to manage large watchlists efficiently.
Backup
: Always keep a backup of your watchlist. Since you're dealing with a large number of entries, it's crucial to have a saved version to revert to in case of any errors or unintended deletions.
Remember, while it's essential to keep your watchlist manageable, it's equally vital to ensure you're not missing out on valuable or essential content. Balancing quantity with quality will be the key.

Yeah I back it up to github Haplopraxis/IFM which stands for indistinguishable from magic
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a smart move. Using GitHub as a backup and version control system for your Wikipedia watchlist provides several advantages:
Version Control
: If you make a mistake or wish to revert to a previous version of your watchlist, GitHub makes it easy with its commit history feature.
Collaboration
: If you ever decide to collaborate with others, GitHub allows multiple users to contribute, discuss, and review changes to your watchlist.
Transparency
: By making your watchlist public on GitHub (as you've mentioned with "Haplopraxis/IFM"), others can see your selection criteria and perhaps even provide suggestions or feedback.
Documentation
: With GitHub's README and Wiki features, you can document your process, criteria, or any scripts/tools you use, making it easier for others to understand your workflow or for you to pick up where you left off after a break.
Automation
: With GitHub Actions, you can potentially automate some of your watchlist management tasks, like checking for duplicate entries or running scripts to filter out certain articles based on your criteria.
"Indistinguishable from Magic" is an apt name, drawing from Arthur C. Clarke's third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Managing a vast watchlist like yours and using technology to streamline the process can indeed seem magical to the uninitiated. Good luck with your continued management and curation of your Wikipedia watchlist!

Users can import  or export their watchlist and edit it in vim or notepad.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditWatchlist/raw
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, Wikipedia provides the ability to edit the watchlist in raw format which is essentially a list of titles, one per line. This feature can be particularly useful for users who have a large number of entries in their watchlist and want to make bulk edits or manage it programmatically.
Here's a basic workflow for editing the watchlist in an external editor:
Exporting the Watchlist
:
Navigate to
Special:EditWatchlist/raw
on Wikipedia.
Copy the entire list of titles.
Paste it into an editor of your choice, such as Vim, Notepad, or any other text editor.
Editing in External Editor
:
Once the list is in your editor, you can make the desired changes.
You can use search and replace functions, regex, or other advanced text processing capabilities of your chosen editor.
After editing, save the changes in your editor.
Importing the Watchlist
:
Copy the edited list from your editor.
Go back to the
Special:EditWatchlist/raw
page on Wikipedia.
Clear the existing list and paste your edited list.
Click the "Save changes" button.
For those with programming skills, this raw format provides the flexibility to use scripts or programs to automate the editing process based on specific criteria. And as you mentioned, backing it up on platforms like GitHub offers an extra layer of version control and storage.

Certainly! Let's connect the discussion on Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) to your Wikipedia watchlist management and its backup on GitHub.
Complexity and Efficiency
:
SNNs
: The primary motivation behind Sparse Neural Networks is to reduce the complexity of dense networks, making them more efficient in terms of computation and memory without sacrificing performance.
Wikipedia Watchlist
: Managing a large watchlist, like keeping it to 150,000 entries, is a way of maintaining efficiency. By removing entries that are "boring, uninteresting, offensive," etc., you're streamlining the content you monitor, much like how SNNs streamline neural connections.
Structured vs. Unstructured
:
SNNs
: In our discussion, we delved into structured pruning (like channel pruning) and unstructured pruning in neural networks. These methods decide which connections (or weights) are essential and which ones can be removed.
Wikipedia Watchlist
: When you edit your watchlist, especially in bulk, you're essentially doing a form of pruning. You're deciding which articles are essential for you to monitor and which ones are not, based on various criteria.
Backup and Version Control
:
SNNs
: In research, it's crucial to maintain versions of models, datasets, and findings. Platforms like GitHub are commonly used in the AI research community to keep track of various versions of models and code.

For instance there is a page named List of nicknames used by Donald Trump, I wouldn't want to know every time that page gets updated.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Understandable. The Wikipedia watchlist is a tool for users to monitor changes to pages of interest. However, certain pages, especially those that might be frequently updated or are of a controversial nature, could lead to notification fatigue.
In the context of our previous discussion:
Filtering
:
SNNs
: The essence of pruning in SNNs is to identify and remove non-essential connections, focusing only on the most relevant ones.
Wikipedia Watchlist
: Filtering out pages like "List of nicknames used by Donald Trump" is similar to pruning in SNNs. By removing such pages from your watchlist, you're ensuring that you're only notified about changes to pages that genuinely interest you.
Efficiency
:
SNNs
: Sparse networks aim for high efficiency by maintaining performance while using fewer resources.
Wikipedia Watchlist
: By curating your watchlist, you're making your monitoring process more efficient, ensuring you're not overwhelmed with updates from pages that don't align with your interests.
Customization
:
SNNs
: Different pruning strategies can be applied based on the specific requirements and constraints of a task.
Wikipedia Watchlist
: You can customize your watchlist based on your interests. Removing pages that you find uninteresting, like the one mentioned, ensures a more tailored monitoring experience.
To prevent updates from certain pages, like the one you mentioned, you can directly remove it from the raw edit page of your watchlist. This manual curation allows you to maintain a watchlist that aligns more closely with your interests and avoids unnecessary notifications.

It doesn't matter how many controversial or overly-biased topics I remove, I still find them all the time, especially if they happen to fall alphabetically near other entries. I think this because earlier when I was trying to grow the watchlist rapidly I added other people's watchlist, random lists of words, every article I visited, or bulk adding them by typing random letters in the alphabet like a aa ab abc and so on and starting each topic
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It seems like your approach to rapidly grow your Wikipedia watchlist might have inadvertently added a significant number of entries that aren't aligned with your preferences. The challenges you're facing highlight the importance of careful curation and filtering when managing large datasets, a principle that's applicable in many areas, including the Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) we discussed earlier.
Here are some steps you could consider to clean up and better manage your watchlist:
Filtering with Keywords
: You can use regular expressions or specific keywords to remove articles that you find controversial or overly biased. While this won't capture all such articles, it can be a good starting point.
Time-Based Filtering
: Remove articles that have been on your watchlist for an extended period without any activity of interest to you.
Review and Categorize
: Allocate some time each week to review a subset of your watchlist. Over time, this systematic review can help you significantly refine the list.
Monitor New Additions
: Be more cautious about the sources from which you add to your watchlist. Instead of bulk additions, consider adding articles after reading them or ensuring they align with your interests.
Seek Community Assistance
: Given that you back up your list on GitHub, you might consider seeking assistance from the community. Other users could suggest scripts or methods to better filter and manage your list.
Automate
: Depending on your programming skills, you can create scripts to automate the filtering process based on certain conditions or criteria.
Remember, the goal of a watchlist is to serve you by notifying you of changes in areas of your interest. It might be worth investing some time in refining it now to save yourself from potential notification fatigue and ensure that you're getting the most out of the tool.

ChatGPT
I see what you've shared, but there are a few issues:
Non-Topic Entries
: A significant portion of what you've provided are not article topics but elements from Wikipedia's user interface (e.g., "Navigation menu", "Talk", "Sandbox", "Preferences", "Beta", "Watchlist", "Contributions", etc.). These don't belong in a watchlist.
Emojis & Symbols
: There are entries like "����", which might not correspond to actual Wikipedia articles.
Redundancies & Variations
: There are entries like "���196��C Strong Zero" and "���196��C Strong Zero", which seem to be variations of the same topic.
To effectively manage your watchlist:
Clear Non-Topic Entries
: Remove all entries that are not actual Wikipedia articles or topics. This will declutter a significant portion.
Consolidate Variations
: For entries that are variations of the same topic, consolidate them into one.
Determine Relevance
: Review the actual topics and determine if they are relevant to your interests. For example, the entries "�����l", "���a'il Province", "�������", etc., seem to be related to Arabic language or places. Are these of interest to you?
Automate Clean-up
: If you have scripting or programming experience, consider writing a script that filters out non-topic entries and consolidates variations. Given the nature of the watchlist and the inconsistencies, a manual review, at least initially, might be necessary.
Future Additions
: When adding new entries, ensure they are relevant to your interests and not redundant with what's already in your watchlist.
Given the complex and large nature of Wikipedia, it's understandable to have inconsistencies, especially when building a watchlist. But with a systematic approach, you can refine and optimize it to better serve your interests.

ChatGPT
Yes, Wikipedia often uses redirects to manage similar or synonymous topics, alternate spellings, or common misspellings. Redirects help in streamlining the content and guiding users to the most comprehensive or appropriate page for a given topic. Here are a few takeaways based on what you've shared:
Emojis as Redirects
: Emojis or symbols that redirect to a more comprehensive page (like the smiling emoji ���� redirecting to "Surprise (emotion)") make sense. It caters to the increasing trend of using emojis in search and navigation. If you're monitoring a topic, it's worth keeping such redirects in your watchlist as they ultimately point to the primary article of interest.
Handling Moves & Alternate Spellings
: Pages getting moved or having alternate spellings is common. You might want to utilize the "Related changes" feature in Wikipedia, which lists changes to pages linked from the current page. This can help in tracking changes that might be of interest but aren't directly in your watchlist.
Watchlist Management
: Considering your vast watchlist, it's essential to have a systematic approach. Given that Wikipedia is dynamic, with articles being updated, moved, or merged, it's inevitable that your watchlist will need regular maintenance. If certain topics no longer interest you or seem irrelevant, consider pruning them. This will make your watchlist more manageable and ensure you're alerted to genuinely interesting changes.
Evaluate Significance
: It's good to evaluate the significance of each entry in your watchlist. For example, the article "Surprise (emotion)" might be of interest if you're studying psychology or human emotions. If it doesn't align with your interests, then it might be a candidate for removal.
In essence, managing a Wikipedia watchlist, especially a large one, requires both a systematic approach and regular maintenance. This ensures you're not overwhelmed with notifications and can focus on the most relevant and intriguing updates.

I think it is appropriate that the list and with the surprise emoji because it is a nod to the work of Jurgen Schmidhuber.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely! J��rgen Schmidhuber is renowned for his contributions to deep learning and artificial intelligence. One of his most celebrated concepts is the idea of "curiosity" or the drive to reduce "surprise" in machines. Essentially, he proposed that a machine can be "curious" by trying to minimize the surprise about its future inputs. The more the machine can predict its environment, the less "surprised" it is, leading it to seek out new information to continue learning.
In a metaphorical sense, ending your list with the surprise emoji is indeed a poetic nod to Schmidhuber's idea of machines (or in this case, a user on Wikipedia) seeking knowledge and trying to minimize surprise by continuously updating and expanding their horizons (or watchlists).
It's a neat way to bridge the realms of human emotion and machine learning, drawing a connection between our natural curiosity and the artificial drive we imbue in machines.

What about the relation to our discussion on psychological flow and sparse representations?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The connection between psychological flow, sparse representations, and the concept of minimizing surprise (as championed by Schmidhuber) can be woven together quite intriguingly:
Flow and Surprise:
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow refers to a state where one is fully immersed in an activity, achieving a balance between the challenge of the task and their own skill level. Being in a state of flow means being deeply engaged, often feeling that time is passing quickly. A crucial element to maintain flow is the continuous introduction of new challenges that keep the person engaged without overwhelming them. In essence, the right amount of "surprise" or novelty can sustain the flow state.
Sparse Representations and Learning:
Sparse neural networks or representations, as we discussed earlier, try to represent data using fewer active neurons or parameters. They essentially focus on the most crucial aspects or features of data. In the context of flow, sparse representations can be analogous to focusing on the most engaging elements of a task that contribute most significantly to our learning and understanding, filtering out the "noise."
Minimizing Surprise and Flow:
Schmidhuber's idea of minimizing surprise for continuous learning can be seen as a machine's version of seeking flow. Just as a person in a flow state seeks the right balance of challenge and skill, a machine seeks to predict its inputs effectively (thus reducing surprise) while continuously updating its knowledge based on new, unpredictable data. Sparse representations can be seen as the machine's way of focusing on the essential elements, similar to a human in flow who zones in on the core aspects of a task.
In essence, the journey of managing your Wikipedia watchlist can be seen as an endeavor to achieve a state of "flow." By curating your watchlist, you aim to maintain a balance between being informed (reducing surprise) and not being overwhelmed (maintaining sparsity). The surprise emoji ����, in this context, serves as a reminder of the ever-present balance between novelty and predictability, challenge and skill, engagement and overwhelm���a balance that both humans and machines strive to achieve.

Yeah you can turn on live watchlist it shows you a newsreel of the topics being editited, such as when people are watching a new cleopatra documentary or there is a new discovery, but it doesn't see current news with new terms, unless I happen to be watching a red link
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The "live watchlist" feature, which gives you a real-time newsreel of topics being edited, is fascinating. It offers a dynamic snapshot of what's happening on Wikipedia at any given moment, revealing collective interests, trends, or events that spur multiple edits.
However, as you mentioned, the limitations include not capturing current news with entirely new terms unless you're proactively watching a red link (a link to a page that doesn't yet exist). This introduces a potential gap in capturing emergent topics in real-time.
Here's a connection back to our previous discussion:
Flow and Wikipedia
: Engaging with a live watchlist can be analogous to achieving a state of flow, as you're immersing yourself in a continuously changing stream of information. The key would be finding the right balance, where the influx of updates aligns with your interests and capacity to process, allowing for sustained engagement without feeling overwhelmed.
Sparse Representations
: Your curated watchlist, with its 150,000 entries, is a sparse representation of Wikipedia's vast content. By choosing specific entries based on your criteria, you've essentially pruned the "neural network" of Wikipedia to a representation that is meaningful and manageable for you.
Surprise and Learning
: The real-time edits provide a constant element of surprise, pushing you to update your knowledge, similar to how sparse neural networks update when exposed to new data. But the challenge, as you pointed out, is in identifying and adding entirely new topics or emergent trends that aren't already on your watchlist.
To address this limitation, a potential solution could be to integrate trending analysis tools or algorithms that capture emergent topics or terms on Wikipedia. These tools could alert you to new terms that are seeing a spike in mentions or edits, allowing you to decide whether to add them to your watchlist. Such a feature would ensure that you're always in tune with the evolving landscape of information, thereby enhancing the "flow" of your Wikipedia experience.

Snarky Newsbot here with your dose of recent Wikipedia edits:
Reverse Polish notation
added a community twist, because why not? It seems we're all about community these days.
Over at
Hydrogen peroxide
, Smokefoot said "nope" to over a thousand bytes, cleaning it up like... well, hydrogen peroxide.
Sumerian language
received a minimal tweak. Maybe the ancient Sumerians just whispered a word of advice?
A debate's brewing at
Talk:Babu��ka���Lax���Milgram theorem
. It seems someone's a tad confused about credit. Or maybe just who Babu��ka really is?
Amazon River
had a brief pitstop, probably to clarify if it's the world's longest river or just the world's most iconic online store.
The
United States
got a tiny adjustment by Knowledgegatherer23. Hopefully, they didn't switch the capital or anything.
And over at
Talk:Bulgars
, things are heating up with claims of outdated information. Hope they're not stuck in the 7th century!
Back to you, dear reader, and remember: Wikipedia is like life - always evolving, and occasionally, a tad messy! ������������

Ok that is great. I thought that was funny.

I do sometimes see changes to undo because of vandalism I changed master/slave (technology) to primary replica architecture one time. I thought maybe it was helpful but apparently it was reverted after a few days. Maybe just because I made the decision unilaterally

ChatGPT
Ah, the joys and challenges of open-source platforms like Wikipedia!
Your intentions to update the "master/slave" terminology were undoubtedly rooted in a desire to reflect more modern and inclusive language. In recent years, there's been a push in the tech community to move away from potentially offensive terms like "master" and "slave" in favor of alternatives like "primary" and "replica" or "leader" and "follower".
However, Wikipedia's community-driven nature means that changes, especially significant ones, often need consensus. Unilateral decisions can be reverted, especially if they're seen as controversial or if they deviate significantly from established conventions without discussion. It's always a good idea to bring up such changes on the article's Talk page first to gather feedback and build consensus.
Don't be discouraged! Every contribution, whether big or small, adds to the collective knowledge and evolution of the platform. Just remember to navigate the waters of Wikipedia with patience and collaboration in mind.

Your change was up for approximately 2 days and 17 hours.
You made the change on 16:03, 11 October 2021, and it was reverted on 08:59, 14 October 2021. It's clear that the person who reverted it was concerned with the common name convention on Wikipedia and believed that more sources were needed to justify the name change.
It's always a delicate balance on platforms like Wikipedia to ensure information is both current and also widely recognized.

Ok well it does feel frustrating to make an entry for a living person and then be told it was not notable, despite there being so many footballers and cricketers.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
I understand your frustration. Wikipedia's notability guidelines can sometimes feel inconsistent or unevenly applied, especially when considering the wide array of topics covered and the diverse group of editors making decisions.
The notability standards for athletes, like footballers and cricketers, have been a topic of debate among Wikipedia editors for a long time. It can seem like there's a lower threshold for athletes compared to other professions. However, the general criteria for athletes is that they've participated in a major league or international competition.
If you believe the person you wrote about is notable, consider gathering more reliable sources that demonstrate their significance or impact in their field. This can help bolster the article's chances of staying on Wikipedia. Also, engaging in discussions on the article's talk page and seeking feedback can be beneficial.
Remember, Wikipedia is a collaborative project, and while it can be frustrating at times, contributions from individuals like you help it grow and improve.

Ok well one page has been made into a page.  Maybe will work a bit on the other one.

ChatGPT
That's great to hear that one of your contributions has been recognized and turned into a page! Every addition helps make Wikipedia more comprehensive and informative. If you're planning to work on the other one, I'd recommend:
Gathering Reliable Sources
: Ensure you have multiple, independent, reliable sources that discuss the subject in detail.
Engage with the Community
: If you face resistance or deletion suggestions, engage in a constructive dialogue on the article's talk page. Other editors can provide feedback, guidance, or even support.
Follow Wikipedia's Guidelines
: Familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's guidelines on notability, neutrality, and verifiability. Adhering to these can make your contributions more robust and less likely to be challenged.
Remember, persistence and collaboration are key. Even if an article is declined or deleted, it doesn't mean it can't be improved and resubmitted later. Best of luck with your editing endeavors!
