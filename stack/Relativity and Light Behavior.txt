You should not say moving faster slows down time, but that the interval between events is shortest in the reference frame where the two events happen at the same place.

On a rocket traveling at near the speed of light, a light bouncing between two mirrors appears to leave one plate and return back to it.

An outside observer will see the light traveling in a triangle zig zag pattern and so will measure a longer interval between the events since it appears to travel a longer distance and the speed of light is fixed.

An observer back on earth will see the "image" of the events appearing to take longer because the light at the end of event has to travel farther than the light at its beginning.

To an observer at the rocket's destination, the events appear to be happening faster because the ship is coming towards you. But nothing on the ship is slowing down or speeding up, rather, it appears so to an outside observer.

Light is actually a moving electric field which makes a moving magnetic field which makes a moving electric field. It makes no sense to say that light moves instantaneously anywhere it is constantly fluctuating between magnetic and electric.

It doesn't have complex parts so it doesn't have memory or the ability to observe. Photons or discrete quanta of light don't exist until they are "observed"'by being absorbed by the electron field of an atom at its destination.

While in transit, light is fluctuating between magnetic and electric fields which is what causes it to propagate forward. In one second light travels like 300 million meters which means it has fluctuated back and forth between magnetism and electricity many many times, depending on its wavelength.

Photons don't travel at all, it is a vibrating field but it can only be absorbed in discrete amounts, because the electron field of the atom can only absorb or emit it in discrete amounts. There is no "photon" traveling between two points only a vibrating field.

You've presented a fascinating view of how we interpret the behavior of light and time under relativistic conditions! Your explanation touches on key concepts of relativity and quantum electrodynamics in an engaging way.
Relativity of Simultaneity and Time Dilation
: Your first paragraphs delve into the relativity of simultaneity and time dilation beautifully. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the interval (or elapsed time) between two events can indeed vary depending on the observer's state of motion relative to where the events occur. This concept is crucial in understanding why an observer on a spaceship moving at relativistic speeds will measure time differently compared to an observer at rest relative to the ship.
Light's Path and Observation
: You correctly noted how light's path appears differently to observers based on their frames of reference, which can lead to different measurements of time and distance due to the constant speed of light in vacuum (c). This ties into how we perceive events and the implications of observing phenomena at relativistic speeds.
Nature of Light
: Your explanation of light as oscillating electric and magnetic fields (electromagnetic waves) is spot-on. Light indeed propagates through this continuous exchange of energy between its electric and magnetic components, without requiring a medium. This is fundamentally different from sound waves, which require a medium to travel.
Photon's Existence and Observation
: Here, your description moves into a more interpretive and less conventionally accepted area of physics. The standard model of particle physics and quantum mechanics generally treats photons as real, existing entities that can be detected (e.g., in a photomultiplier tube or a CCD in a camera). Photons are considered quantized packets of electromagnetic energy, which can indeed be absorbed or emitted discretely by atoms.
Quantum Field Theory
: Your comments about photons not existing until observed, reflecting a more philosophical or interpretive stance on quantum mechanics, align with some interpretations of quantum field theory (QFT). In QFT, fields are fundamental, and particles are excitations of these fields. However, it's broadly accepted that these excitations (particles like photons) exist and have real effects, observable in experiments, even when not being directly absorbed or emitted.
Your perspective invites deep thought about the nature of reality and how we understand the universe through physics. It's a rich area of ongoing research and philosophical debate. Each part of your explanation contributes to a broader discussion about how we interpret the laws of physics and the nature of observation itself.

I don't think you understood. A vibrating field is not a "particle". A photomultiplier tube or CCD indicates a measurement that is there is some atom which absorbs it

You've raised an important point regarding the nature of light and how it is detected, which does indeed touch on deeper aspects of quantum mechanics and the distinction between particles and fields.
In quantum field theory (QFT), what we traditionally think of as particles (like photons, electrons, etc.) are indeed treated as excitations or quanta of underlying fields. For example, a photon is considered a quantum of the electromagnetic field. This framework supports the idea that what we detect as particles are manifestations of field fluctuations.
However, when photons interact with a detector like a photomultiplier tube or a CCD camera, these instruments detect energy deposited by the photon when it is absorbed by the material in the detector. This process results in an electron being excited or released, which is then amplified into a measurable signal. Each detection event is discrete, which reinforces the particle-like behavior of photons in this context.
Your point about light being a vibrating field, rather than a particle, aligns with the wave description of light in classical electromagnetism and the field description in quantum electrodynamics. Yet, the discrete detections we observe suggest particle-like properties as well. This duality is at the heart of quantum mechanics' wave-particle duality concept, where light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how we observe or measure them.
This dual nature can be confusing, but it is a cornerstone of modern physics, illustrating the complexity and sometimes counterintuitive nature of quantum phenomena. The essence of quantum mechanics often challenges our classical intuitions about how particles and waves should behave.
