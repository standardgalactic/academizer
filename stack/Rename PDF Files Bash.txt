To rename all files from
Interstellar-Voyage-01.pdf
,
Interstellar-Voyage-02.pdf
, etc., to
Intrastellar-Voyage-01.pdf
,
Intrastellar-Voyage-02.pdf
, etc., you can use a simple bash command. Here's a one-liner that should do the trick:
bash
Copy code
for
f
in
Interstellar-Voyage-*.pdf;
do
mv
"
$f
"
"
${f/Interstellar/Intrastellar}
"
;
done
This command does the following:
It loops over all files in the current directory that match the pattern
Interstellar-Voyage-*.pdf
.
For each file, it uses
mv
to rename the file.
The
${f/Interstellar/Intrastellar}
part is a parameter expansion in bash that replaces the first occurrence of "Interstellar" with "Intrastellar" in the filename.
Make sure to run this command in the directory where your files are located. Also, it's always a good idea to back up your files before running bulk rename operations, just in case something unexpected happens.

no it doesn't work try something less complicated

Sure, let's try a simpler approach. You can use a
for
loop along with
sed
to handle the renaming. Here's a straightforward bash command:
bash
Copy code
for
f
in
Interstellar-Voyage-*.pdf;
do
mv
"
$f
"
"
$(echo $f | sed 's/Interstellar/Intrastellar/')
"
;
done
This command works as follows:
It loops through files that match the pattern
Interstellar-Voyage-*.pdf
.
For each file, it uses
sed
to replace "Interstellar" with "Intrastellar" in the filename.
The
mv
command then renames the file from the original name to the new name.
Again, execute this command in the directory containing your files. It's a good idea to test the command with one file first or to backup your files to prevent any accidental data loss.
