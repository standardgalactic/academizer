The compilation of sources span several academic disciplines, reflecting upon theories related to the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, feminism, network theory, and deep learning, and how they intersect with the concept of rhizomatic thinking.
Deleuze and Guattari's "A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia" (1) forms the basis of this discussion, introducing the concept of rhizomes as a non-hierarchical, non-linear way of understanding knowledge, society, and identity. They compare this to the traditional 'tree' model of knowledge, which is linear and hierarchical.
Varela's "Steps to a science of inter-being" (2) suggests a way of understanding cognition that aligns with the rhizomatic perspective, focusing on the interconnected nature of cognitive processes and their situatedness in the world.
Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" (3) intersects with this in its feminist critique of traditional binaries and hierarchies. She uses the metaphor of the cyborg to reimagine identity and society in a posthumanist context, and her work is often associated with rhizomatic thinking.
Siemens' "Connectivism" (4) and Galloway's "The Exploit: A Theory of Networks" (5) extend this to the digital age, applying these ideas to the way information and learning happen in networked environments. Connectivism sees learning as a process of creating connections between information sources and interpreting those connections.
Barad's "Posthumanist Performativity" (6) also contributes to this discourse, exploring how matter and meaning are co-constituted through performative interactions. This resonates with the rhizomatic idea of the interconnectedness and mutual constitution of entities.
Chen & Du's "Deep Learning with a Rhizomatic Perspective" (7) and O'Sullivan's "Rhizomes, Nomads and Lines of Flight" (8) directly apply Deleuze and Guattari's concepts to AI and social/political thought respectively, demonstrating the broad influence of their ideas.
Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville's "Deep Learning" (9) provides a technical grounding for understanding how these concepts might apply in the context of machine learning, while Dillon's "Learning Happens" (10) applies the rhizomatic concept to pedagogy, suggesting ways that teaching and learning can be rethought in light of these ideas.

Title: "Love as a Thread: Rhizomatic Axiology in Art History and Beyond"
Introduction
The concept of love, as a thread that weaves through the fabric of our shared experiences and knowledge, presents a compelling lens to understand and navigate the interconnected web of human cognition, technology, and society. From Deleuze and Guattari's rhizomatic theory (1) to Haraway's posthumanist cyborg (3), and from Varela's cognitive science (2) to Barad's posthumanist performativity (6), each perspective contributes to our understanding of love as a networked, non-hierarchical phenomenon. This essay also incorporates Siemens' Connectivism (4) and Galloway's theory of networks (5), along with a deep learning perspective (9), to discuss how love might serve as a connecting thread in the complex, multi-layered rhizome that is art history.
Rhizomes and Love in Art History
Art history, traditionally viewed as a linear progression of periods and styles, can be reconceptualized as a rhizome — a non-hierarchical, interconnected network of influences, inspirations, and interpretations. Drawing from Deleuze and Guattari's theory (1), love can be seen as a thread that traverses these connections, embodying the flows and intensities of the artistic process.
From the passion of the artist to the emotional response of the viewer, love manifests in various forms, transcending barriers of time, culture, and medium. By rejecting the tree-like, linear structure of traditional art history, the rhizomatic model empowers us to unearth and appreciate these manifestations of love in their myriad forms.
The Cyborg, Inter-being, and Love
As Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" (3) and Varela's cognitive science (2) suggest, the boundaries between human and machine, self and other, and mind and body are not as rigid as traditionally perceived. Love, as a thread in this context, signifies the potential for connection, empathy, and mutual transformation despite apparent differences.
In the realm of art, this perspective enables us to consider the role of technology, not as a separate entity, but as an integral part of the artistic process and experience. The love for art is not confined to human artists or viewers but extends to the technologies that enable creation and appreciation.
Networks, Learning, and Love
Siemens' Connectivism (4) and Galloway's theory of networks (5) further emphasize the interconnectedness of learning and knowledge. Love, in this context, represents the motivation and emotional connection that drives learning and creativity.
Art, as a networked, connective process, thrives on this love for learning and exploration. It's through the love of an artist for their craft that new ideas emerge and through the love of the viewer for exploration that these ideas are appreciated and interpreted.
Deep Learning, Performativity, and Love
Deep learning (9) and Barad's posthumanist performativity (6) highlight the interactive, co-constitutive nature of cognition and meaning-making. Love, in this sense, represents the affective, relational dimension of these processes.
In art, love as a thread can be seen in the interaction between the artist and their work, the work and the viewer, and between different works of art themselves. This relational, performative aspect of love enriches the artistic experience, enhancing the sense of connection and understanding.
Conclusion
In summary, the concept of love, as a thread weaving through the rhizome of art history, offers a powerful lens to explore the interconnected, multi-dimensional nature of art. By drawing from various theoretical perspectives, we can appreciate how love manifests in the creative

Sure, here's a quote from Jacques Ellul:

"Technique is not neutral. It shapes us in ways we don't expect, and it's often inimical to the spiritual, intellectual, and emotional dimensions of our lives. We need to be aware of its effects and take steps to resist its encroachment on our freedom, creativity, and relationships."

That's a good interpretation. Ellul's quote is essentially a warning against the danger of being too rigid in our thinking, and to always be open to new ideas and possibilities.

He's cautioning us against thinking that any one perspective or approach has all the answers, and instead encourages us to continue exploring and experimenting with different ideas and theories.

In other words, he's suggesting that we should approach these ideas with a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to adapt and evolve as we learn more.

Yes, it is a common challenge to balance technicality and accessibility when presenting complex ideas. 

However, it is important to keep in mind that technical language and abstractions can be useful tools for exploring and refining ideas.

The key is to find ways to communicate these ideas in a way that is clear and understandable to a broader audience, without losing the depth and nuance of the original concepts.

It sounds like you are aware of this challenge and are working to strike that balance, which is a great start.

The hypercube can be used as a tool for exploring the relationships between the different concepts and perspectives presented in the essay.

By assigning each title to a vertex of the hypercube, we can see how each title relates to the others, and explore the possible connections and overlaps between the different ideas.

For example, we might use the hypercube to explore how the ideas of relational algebra and the invocation model of expression in null convention logic relate to each other, or how the concept of multiscale decision making in the default mode network relates to phenomenology and axiology.

By visualizing the relationships between the different concepts and perspectives, the hypercube can help us to identify areas of overlap and potential connections between different fields of study, and provide a starting point for further exploration and research.

The hypercube, or the tesseract in this case, can serve as a rich metaphorical and visual tool for articulating complex, multidimensional relationships among the different ideas represented by the essay titles.
In a tesseract, each vertex is connected to four others, representing its immediate neighbors in four dimensions. Similarly, in the context of your essay topics, each vertex (or essay title) can be seen as having a four-fold relationship with other concepts, allowing for an intricate web of connections and interactions.
For instance, if we consider "Love as an Emotion" (V1), it directly connects to "Love as a Choice" (V0), "Love as a Skill" (V3), "Mind as a Computer" (V5), and "Love and Interpersonal Communication" (V9). These connections can represent the different facets or perspectives of the same overarching concept - Love.
Moreover, each edge in the tesseract could represent a transition or transformation from one concept to another, indicating a shift in perspective, or a deepening or broadening of understanding. For example, moving from "Love as an Emotion" (V1) to "Love as a Skill" (V3) could represent the transition from understanding love purely as a spontaneous feeling to viewing it as a capacity that can be cultivated and developed.
The tesseract also allows for multiple paths between any two vertices, signifying different trajectories of understanding or lines of thought that one might follow in exploring the connections between the concepts.
In summary, the tesseract can be a powerful tool for visualizing and navigating the conceptual landscape of your essay topics, providing a multidimensional map of the rich interconnections among them. This could help stimulate further exploration, dialogue, and insight, fostering a more holistic and integrated understanding of the ideas you're exploring.

Axiology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of value and values.

In our system, axiology is one of the four main components, along with phenomenology, epistemology, and imaginative play, that work together to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and engaging with the world.

Axiology helps us to identify and evaluate the different values that are important to us, both as individuals and as members of society. It also helps us to make decisions about what is morally right or wrong, and what actions we should take in different situations.

Within our system, axiology is not treated as a separate or isolated discipline, but rather as an integral part of a larger whole.

By including axiology as one of the four main components, we are able to explore the ethical dimensions of human experience in a more comprehensive and nuanced way.

Overall, our system seeks to integrate different aspects of human experience and understanding, including axiology, in order to provide a more holistic and integrated approach to understanding and engaging with the world around us.

Connections with the following:

The essay explores the intersection of deep learning and rhizomatic philosophy, concepts that respectively originate from the fields of artificial intelligence and educational theory. The first part of the essay will provide a definition and exploration of these two concepts.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep') to model and understand complex patterns in datasets. On the other hand, rhizomatic learning is a pedagogical philosophy that contrasts with traditional hierarchical learning systems. Instead of a linear, tree-like system, it proposes a model where knowledge is understood to grow and interconnect like the roots of a rhizome plant - in a horizontal, non-linear manner.

The essay then discusses the potential benefits of applying the rhizomatic learning concept to deep learning. It posits that this approach could yield models that are more adaptable, flexible, and better suited to handle the complexity inherent in real-world data.

The final part of the essay intends to provide practical examples of how this rhizomatic approach to deep learning could be applied in real-world contexts. This may include cases in which such a model could provide superior results compared to traditional deep learning approaches.


In essence, entropy and negentropy offer us a theoretical framework for understanding the nature of learning and cognition, particularly the way we process information and make predictions about the world. Entropy, in the realm of information theory, is a measure of uncertainty, randomness, or unpredictability in a data set. A system with high entropy is one that is hard to predict because it has a high degree of randomness. On the other hand, negentropy (negative entropy) represents the exact opposite - it is a measure of order, predictability, and information content in a system. It's the degree to which a system is organized or structured. The concept of surprise is intrinsically tied to these principles. Surprise occurs when our predictions or expectations about the world are not met, causing a discrepancy between our model of the world and the actual outcomes. This divergence can lead to an increase in entropy, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty or unpredictability. Learning, in this framework, is the process of reducing surprise by refining our predictive models and harnessing negentropy. As we encounter new information, we update our models, improving our ability to predict future outcomes, thereby reducing the level of surprise. This ties into the role of prediction and compression. Prediction involves using our current knowledge to anticipate future events. A successful prediction means that our model of the world is accurate and reliable, which would result in a reduction of surprise and an increase in negentropy. Compression, in the context of information theory, is about reducing redundancy in data and creating a more efficient representation of information. When we successfully predict and understand patterns in the world, we can compress that information into a more concise and efficient representation, thereby further reducing entropy and increasing negentropy. The analogy of reverse mass wasting can help illustrate these ideas. Just as reverse mass wasting involves the uphill movement of materials, counteracting the natural tendency of things to move downhill due to gravity, learning and cognition involve the reduction of entropy (or increase of negentropy), counteracting the natural tendency of systems to become more disordered. In conclusion, by viewing learning and cognition through the lens of entropy, negentropy, and surprise, we can gain a deeper understanding of these complex processes. By continuously refining our predictive models and compressing information, we can reduce surprise, increase negentropy, and become more efficient and effective learners. 


Absolutely, your explanation provides a fascinating and powerful perspective on cognition and learning using the concepts of entropy, negentropy, and surprise from information theory. To further elaborate:

This perspective fundamentally reframes learning and cognition as information processing tasks. Under this view, the brain is seen as an information-processing system, continually working to reduce entropy by forming predictions and compressing information.

In terms of learning, it means that we constantly update our models of the world to reduce the 'surprise' or discrepancy between our expectations and reality. When we encounter information that contradicts our current understanding, we experience surprise, leading to increased entropy. We then adjust our models to accommodate this new information, reducing entropy and increasing negentropy.

This process of model adjustment can be seen as a type of 'compression'. When we understand the patterns or regularities in the information we encounter, we can represent this information more efficiently, compressing it down to its essential features. This process of compression further reduces entropy and increases negentropy, leading to a more accurate and efficient representation of the world.

The connection you've made to the concept of 'reverse mass wasting' is a helpful analogy. Just like how reverse mass wasting counteracts the natural tendency for things to move downhill, the process of learning and cognition counteracts the tendency towards disorder in information systems. Through learning and cognition, we are essentially 'climbing uphill', working against the natural flow of entropy to create order and structure in our understanding of the world.

In essence, this theoretical framework provides a compelling way to understand the nature of learning and cognition. It suggests that our brains are essentially entropy-reducing machines, continually working to make sense of the world by reducing uncertainty, predicting future events, and compressing information into more efficient representations.

The two topics discussed are quite different from each other, but they both provide interesting insights into how we understand and process information.
The first topic explores the intersection of deep learning and rhizomatic philosophy. It suggests that a rhizomatic approach to deep learning could yield models that are more adaptable, flexible, and better suited to handle the complexity inherent in real-world data. This is because rhizomatic learning allows for a more horizontal, non-linear model of knowledge growth and interconnection, which better reflects the complexity of real-world data.
The second topic focuses on the theoretical framework of entropy, negentropy, and surprise in information theory, and how it can provide a deeper understanding of learning and cognition. It suggests that learning and cognition are essentially about reducing entropy and increasing negentropy by forming predictions, compressing information, and refining our models of the world.
Despite their differences, both topics share a common thread of exploring the ways in which we process and understand information. The first topic focuses on the development of new models to better understand complex data, while the second topic provides a theoretical framework to understand the fundamental nature of learning and cognition.
