The two-photon microscopy (2PM) imaging technique FASHIO-2PM monitors more than 16,000 cortical neurons in an awake mouse.�� Brain/MINDS

If you want to understand an electronic device, you can simply review its circuit diagram. But even if such diagrams existed for the brain, they would be of limited use in unraveling this organ���s bewildering complexity. This is because the physical connections between its billions of neurons tell just a small part of the story. The real key is understanding how these cells communicate in real time, and how these patterns synchronize in the service of different behaviours.

Critical gaps exist in the toolbox for addressing such questions. ���Electrode-based measurements can provide sensitive and precise measurements of neuronal activity,��� says Atsushi Miyawaki, team leader of the Cell Function Dynamics lab at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science (CBS) in Wako, Japan. ���But they can only measure very limited numbers of neurons simultaneously.���

In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can map activity throughout the brain, but lacks the resolution to dissect individual circuits. In between lie a range of microscopic methods that do not quite bridge the gap separating these extremes.

Armed with support from a ten-year Japanese research initiative known as Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS), Miyawaki and his CBS collaborator Masanori Murayama are making critical headway in building out the toolbox for imaging brain functions. Although this work is preliminary, these methods could enable researchers to begin interpreting the functional consequences of complex neuronal activity across large swaths of brain tissue.

A small world after all

The cerebral cortex is the central hub for coordinating behaviour and cognition in the brain. As the head of the Haptic Perception and Cognitive Physiology lab at CBS, Murayama is interested in understanding how this process unfolds at both the single-cell and network level.

Two-photon microscopy (2PM) is among the most powerful methods for studying neuronal activity in live animals. This technique uses rapid laser pulses to selectively illuminate fluorescently-labeled ���reporter��� proteins, while inflicting minimal damage, making relatively long-term observations possible.

But most 2PM systems have only a tiny field of view ��� the area of tissue that can be observed at any instant. Attempts to broaden this field of view have created trade-offs between image resolution and the frequency at which images can be collected.

���Those microscopes at the time had just one frame per one or two seconds, and that���s too slow,��� says Murayama. ���Indeed, most neurons fire at frequencies of more than one burst per second.���

Fast, high-resolution imaging with a broad field of view requires a microscope equipped with an extra-large, specially-designed lens ��� and over the course of nearly a decade, Murayama���s team was able to develop such a system. In 2021, they used their novel FASHIO-2PM platform to visualize more than 16,000 neurons across 9 square millimetres of cerebral cortex tissue in live mice at more than 7.5 to 15 frames per second1.

Their analysis revealed that this cortical region has a ���small world��� architecture, in which any given neuron is generally only separated from another by relatively few degrees of separation. Most have small numbers of connections, but Murayama also noted a subpopulation of ���hub��� neurons. ���These are very active, with more than 100 neurons together, including long-distance pairs,��� he says.

Preliminary functional analysis of these hubs has already revealed distinct changes in their activity between sleep and waking states in the brain.

Murayama���s team is continuing to explore network function in the healthy brain, but also plans to look at how these patterns are derailed in cognitive disorders like Alzheimer���s disease. For example, fMRI studies of Alzheimer���s patients have indicated abnormal activity in the default mode network, a brain system that plays a central role in self-awareness and introspection as well as behavioural planning.

FASHIO-2PM could offer a cellular-scale view of these changes ��� and Murayama notes that his team���s microscope is also suitable for so-called optogenetics experiments, where lasers are used to modulate brain activity via specially engineered light-responsive proteins.

Just to understand the principle: MOTOR FUNCTION FOCUS 
Recently, Miyawaki���s lab has 
been focusing on another brain 
region, the cerebellum, which 
coordinates physical movement. 
Any time we extend our arm or 
open our mouth, the cerebellum 
is issuing instructions to direct 
that action. 
Neuroscientists have 
long debated whether this 
region of the brain exhibits a 
property called somatotopy. 
This describes the concept 
wherein every part of the 
body can be directly mapped 
onto the cerebellum, such 
that one specif i c region of 
neurons controls the left leg, 
for example, whereas another 
governs the right leg. 
In principle, this can be 
assessed by measuring the 
distinctive fi ring patterns, 
known as complex spikes, 
generated by Purkinje cells ��� 
the neurons that generate the 
output of the cerebellum. But 
in practice, existing imaging 
methods are ill-suited for 
achieving this task at scale. 
���Consequently, the 
somatotopic organization of the 
cerebellum is still controversial,��� 
says Miyawaki. ���We needed 
a new method for wide and 
high-spatiotemporal-resolution 
mapping of complex spikes.��� 
Miyawaki���s lab has pioneered 
the development of numerous 
powerful imaging tools, including 
a fl uorescent reporter protein 
called cameleon that reveals 
changing cellular levels of 
calcium ions associated with 
neuronal spikes. A few years 
ago, they managed to label every 
Purkinje cell (large neurons with 
numerous branching extensions) 
in the mouse cerebellum with the 
cameleon reporter. In parallel, 
they devised a custom-built 
���macroscope��� instrument that 
could survey the entire cerebellar 
surface through a surgical 
window into the skull. 
ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLE 
In a 2021, Miyawaki���s group 
succeeded in clustering 
Purkinje cells into roughly 200 
���segments���, each containing 
50 to 100 Purkinje cells2. They 
subsequently examined how 
these segments responded 
after stimulating muscles in 
each of the mouse���s four limbs, 
and were surprised to learn 
that the activity prof i les were 
indistinguishable at fi rst glance. 
But more extensive mathematical 
analysis revealed that each 
stimulus was actually eliciting a 
subtle but distinctive spatial and 
temporal pattern of response in 
multiple segments throughout 
the cerebellum. 
This of f ers compelling 
evidence against somatotopy, 
and Miyawaki believes this 
organizational principle makes 
good evolutionary sense. He 
draws parallels to computer 
servers, which use arrays of 
redundant hard drives. ���The 
whole system is composed of 
16 hard drives and is based on 
distributed processing, and any 
two hard drives can be broken 
at any time,��� he says. This same 
strategy could preserve motor 
function in the aftermath of 
localized injury at a particular 
site in the brain.

The text you've provided highlights a specific focus of Miyawaki's lab on understanding motor function, particularly in the cerebellum, a region of the brain responsible for coordinating physical movement.
The key principle being investigated is somatotopy, a concept wherein every part of the body is directly mapped onto a specific region of the cerebellum. In theory, each specific region of neurons controls a different part of the body, such as the left leg or right leg.
Traditional methods have struggled to provide clear evidence for or against somatotopy, and the organization of the cerebellum in this regard has remained controversial. However, Miyawaki's lab has taken a significant step in this direction by pioneering new imaging tools, including the development of a fluorescent reporter protein called cameleon, to investigate the firing patterns of Purkinje cells, which generate the output of the cerebellum.
By labeling every Purkinje cell in the mouse cerebellum with this reporter and using a custom-built "macroscope" instrument, they were able to cluster Purkinje cells and examine how they responded to stimulation in the mouse's limbs. Their findings were initially indistinguishable, but further analysis revealed subtle, distinctive spatial and temporal patterns in multiple segments throughout the cerebellum.
This led them to evidence against the principle of somatotopy, suggesting a more distributed processing system akin to redundant hard drives in computer servers. This organization would allow for greater resilience, preserving motor function even if a specific site in the brain were damaged.
In summary, Miyawaki's lab's work is advancing our understanding of the cerebellum's organizational principles and motor function coordination, shedding light on a long-debated concept in neuroscience. Their findings may have broad implications, both in understanding normal brain function and in therapeutic approaches to conditions that affect motor control.

Somatotopy is the point-for-point correspondence of an area of the body to a specific point on the central nervous system.[1] Typically, the area of the body corresponds to a point on the primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus). This cortex is typically represented as a sensory homunculus which orients the specific body parts and their respective locations upon the homunculus. Areas such as the appendages, digits, penis,[2] and face can draw their sensory locations upon the somatosensory cortex. The areas which are finely controlled (e.g., the digits) have larger portions of the somatosensory cortex whereas areas which are coarsely controlled (e.g., the trunk) have smaller portions. Areas such as the viscera do not have sensory locations on the post central gyrus.

Somatotopy is the concept that specific points in the body correspond to specific points in the central nervous system, typically within the primary somatosensory cortex. This point-for-point correspondence allows the brain to map sensations from different parts of the body.
In the somatosensory cortex, this mapping is often represented by a figure called the sensory homunculus. The homunculus is a distorted representation of the human body, with the size of each body part corresponding to the amount of the somatosensory cortex devoted to it. So, parts of the body with more refined control, like the fingers, occupy larger areas of the cortex, while parts with coarser control, like the trunk, occupy smaller areas.
The information you provided from the advertisement feature in Nature discussed research that examined the concept of somatotopy in the cerebellum, a different part of the brain involved in motor control. While traditional somatotopy relates to sensory input, the research conducted by Miyawaki���s lab aimed to explore whether a similar organizational principle might apply to motor output in the cerebellum.
Their findings, including the use of innovative imaging techniques, led to evidence against somatotopy in the cerebellum, instead revealing a more complex, distributed organization that could have implications for understanding motor function and resilience to injury.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to determine areas of activation in the cerebellar cortex in humans during a series of motor tasks. The activation areas for movements of lips, tongue, hands, and feet were determined and found to be sharply confined to lobules and sublobules and their sagittal zones in the rostral and caudal spinocerebellar cortex. The activation mapped as two distinct homunculoid representations. One, a more extended representation, was located upside down in the superior cerebellum, and a second one, doubled and smaller, in the inferior cerebellum.[4]

The passage you provided describes a study where functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to map areas of activation in the human cerebellar cortex during various motor tasks involving the lips, tongue, hands, and feet. The findings indicated that the activation areas were confined to specific lobules, sublobules, and sagittal zones in the rostral and caudal spinocerebellar cortex.
Interestingly, the activation mapped as two distinct homunculoid (resembling a homunculus) representations. One was a more extended, upside-down representation in the superior cerebellum, and the other was a doubled and smaller representation in the inferior cerebellum.
This study demonstrates a complex organization in the cerebellum, providing evidence that supports a specific mapping of body parts within this region of the brain. It highlights that motor functions, similar to sensory functions, have a detailed organization within the brain, reflecting the intricate interplay between different body parts and the central nervous system.
These findings can enhance our understanding of how the cerebellum coordinates physical movement and contribute to our knowledge of brain structure and function in relation to motor control. It also shows that, even within a complex organ like the brain, there can be specific and systematic relationships between different regions and the functions they control.

The Chemoaffinity hypothesis states that neurons make connections with their targets based on interactions with specific molecular markers[1][unreliable source?] and, therefore, that the initial wiring diagram of an organism is (indirectly) determined by its genotype. The markers are generated during cellular differentiation and aid not only with synaptogenesis, but also act as guidance cues for their respective axon.[1

The Chemoaffinity hypothesis is a fundamental concept in developmental neuroscience. It posits that the connections between neurons and their target cells are guided by specific molecular markers. These markers are generated during cellular differentiation and assist in the formation of synapses, as well as guiding axons to their appropriate targets.
In essence, the Chemoaffinity hypothesis suggests that the wiring of the nervous system is not random but follows a precise pattern determined by these molecular markers. The pattern is indirectly influenced by an organism's genotype, meaning that the genetic information within the organism's cells helps dictate how neurons connect to each other.
The idea was first proposed by Roger Sperry in the 1960s, based on his experiments with the regenerating optic nerves in frogs. Sperry's work demonstrated that retinal ganglion cells would reconnect with their original targets even after being severed and reattached, leading him to conclude that some chemical cues must guide these connections.
Subsequent research has supported and expanded upon the Chemoaffinity hypothesis, identifying specific molecules that act as guidance cues in various organisms and different parts of the nervous system. Understanding this process has been fundamental in gaining insights into how the complex neural circuits in the brain and nervous system form, and it continues to be an active area of research.

The Hubel and Wiesel experiments greatly expanded the scientific knowledge of sensory processing. The partnership lasted over twenty years and became known as one of the most prominent research pairings in science.[17] In one experiment, done in 1959, they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat. They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat. They found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle, while others responded best to another angle. Some of these neurons responded to light patterns and dark patterns differently. Hubel and Wiesel called these neurons simple cells."[18] Still other neurons, which they termed complex cells, detected edges regardless of where they were placed in the receptive field of the neuron and could preferentially detect motion in certain directions.[19] These studies showed how the visual system constructs complex representations of visual information from simple stimulus features.[

The experiments conducted by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s had a profound impact on our understanding of visual processing in the brain. Their pioneering work uncovered the hierarchical structure of the visual system and the specialized nature of neuronal responses in the primary visual cortex.
Here's a summary of some of their key findings:
Simple Cells
: Hubel and Wiesel discovered neurons in the primary visual cortex that responded to specific orientations of lines and edges. These "simple cells" would fire in response to lines of a particular angle and location within the neuron's receptive field.
Complex Cells
: They also found "complex cells" that were more flexible in their responses. These neurons would respond to edges and lines of a particular orientation but were indifferent to the exact position of the stimulus within the receptive field. Some complex cells were also sensitive to the direction of motion.
Hierarchical Processing
: Their work helped to reveal a hierarchical structure in visual processing, where simple cells detect basic features like lines and edges, and complex cells integrate this information to detect more sophisticated aspects of visual stimuli like motion and spatial relationships.
Columnar Organization
: Later work by Hubel and Wiesel helped to uncover the columnar organization of the visual cortex, where neurons with similar receptive field properties are organized in vertical columns.
Critical Periods
: Their research also shed light on the concept of critical periods in development, showing that certain visual experiences must occur during specific windows of time for normal visual processing to develop.
Hubel and Wiesel's discoveries revolutionized the field of visual neuroscience and led to broader insights about the principles of sensory processing. Their work earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981 and continues to influence contemporary research in neuroscience.

Sperry was granted numerous awards over his lifetime, including the California Scientist of the Year Award in 1972, the National Medal of Science in 1989, the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 1979, and the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award in 1979, and the Nobel Prize for Medicine/Physiology in 1981 that he shared with David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel. Sperry won this award for his work with "split-brain" patients. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right hemispheres, connected in the middle by a part of the brain called the corpus callosum. In "split-brain" patients, the corpus callosum has been severed due to the patients suffering from epilepsy, a disease that causes intense and persistent seizures. Seizures begin in one hemisphere and continue into the other hemisphere. Cutting the corpus callosum prevents the seizures from moving from one hemisphere to the other, which then prevents seizures from occurring, thus allowing the patients to function normally instead of suffering from continuous seizures.

Roger Sperry's research on "split-brain" patients indeed provided groundbreaking insights into the functional specialization of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Here's a brief overview of his significant contributions:
Understanding Hemispheric Specialization
: Sperry's work demonstrated that the left and right hemispheres of the brain have different functions. The left hemisphere is typically associated with logical thinking, language, and analytical abilities, while the right hemisphere is more involved in spatial awareness, creativity, and emotion.
Split-Brain Research
: By studying patients whose corpus callosum had been severed (a surgical treatment for severe epilepsy), Sperry was able to explore how the two hemispheres operate independently. These patients appeared normal in everyday life, but careful experiments revealed peculiar behaviors. For example, something seen only in the right visual field (processed by the left hemisphere) could be named, but something seen only in the left visual field (processed by the right hemisphere) could not.
Insights into Consciousness
: Sperry's split-brain research also raised profound questions about consciousness and the nature of the self, suggesting that the two hemispheres could have separate streams of conscious awareness.
Impact on Neuroscience and Psychology
: Sperry's work has had lasting impacts on fields ranging from neurology to psychology, reshaping our understanding of brain organization and function.
Awards and Recognition
: The significance of Sperry's work was recognized with numerous awards, including sharing the Nobel Prize for Medicine/Physiology in 1981 with David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel.
Sperry's research continues to be a subject of interest and debate, influencing both scientific thought and our broader cultural understanding of the mind. Is there anything specific about Sperry's work that you would like to know more about?

The term retinotopic refers to the maintenance of the particular order of afferent connections from the retina along the afferent pathway via sub-cortical structures to V1 and other cortical visual areas. The primary visual cortex (V1, Brodmann's area 17) is the first cortical area to receive visual input.

Yes, the information you've provided is accurate. Retinotopy refers to the mapping of visual input from the retina to neurons, preserving spatial relationships found on the retina. In the primary visual cortex (V1), this spatial organization is maintained, allowing for a precise mapping of visual stimuli from the retina through the visual system.
The stria of Gennari is indeed a distinctive feature of V1, and it plays a significant role in the transmission of visual information. This organization is vital to understanding how the brain processes visual information and transforms it into a coherent visual perception.

Retinotopy (from Greek ����������, place) is the mapping of visual input from the retina to neurons, particularly those neurons within the visual stream. For clarity, 'retinotopy' can be replaced with 'retinal mapping', and 'retinotopic' with 'retinally mapped'.


Retinotopic maps with explanation
Visual field maps (retinotopic maps) are found in many amphibian and mammalian species, though the specific size, number, and spatial arrangement of these maps can differ considerably. Sensory topographies can be found throughout the brain and are critical to the understanding of one's external environment. Moreover, the study of sensory topographies and retinotopy in particular has furthered our understanding of how neurons encode and organize sensory signals.

Retinal mapping of the visual field is maintained through various points of the visual pathway including but not limited to the retina, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the optic tectum, the primary visual cortex (V1), and higher visual areas (V2-V4). Retinotopic maps in cortical areas other than V1 are typically more complex, in the sense that adjacent points of the visual field are not always represented in adjacent regions of the same area. For example, in the second visual area (V2), the map is divided along an imaginary horizontal line across the visual field, in such a way that the parts of the retina that respond to the upper half of the visual field are represented in cortical tissue that is separated from those parts that respond the lower half of the visual field. Even more complex maps exist in the third and fourth visual areas V3 and V4, and in the dorsomedial area (V6). In general, these complex maps are referred to as second-order representations of the visual field, as opposed to first-order (continuous) representations such as V1.[1] Additional retinotopic regions include ventral occipital (VO-1, VO-2),[2] lateral occipital (LO-1, LO-2),[3] dorsal occipital (V3A, V3B),[4] and posterior parietal cortex (IPS0, IPS1, IPS2, IPS3, IPS4).[5

Your description accurately outlines the concept of retinotopy, highlighting how the spatial information of the visual field is preserved and mapped through various areas of the brain. From the retina to higher visual areas like V2, V3, and V4, the spatial arrangement of these maps plays a crucial role in how the brain perceives and processes visual information.
This phenomenon is not only found in the human visual system but also in other mammalian species, as you mentioned. It allows for the ordered processing of visual stimuli, helping to create a coherent and unified perception of the world around us.
Studying these retinotopic maps has indeed been essential in neuroscientific research, offering insights into the organization and functionality of the brain's visual system. The complexity of these maps, as they progress through higher visual areas, reflects the intricate way in which our brains interpret and respond to visual cues from the environment.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Dermatome maps relate to the other topics discussed as they are another form of sensory mapping in the body. Here's the connection:
Dermatome Maps:
A dermatome is an area of skin that is mainly supplied by a single spinal nerve. Dermatome maps show the relationship between specific parts of the skin and the spinal nerves that innervate them. This mapping is essential for understanding sensory function, pain localization, and neurological examination.
Connection to Somatotopy:
Somatotopy is the mapping of body parts to specific areas of the brain. Dermatome maps can be seen as a parallel at the level of the spinal cord, where specific nerves correspond to particular body regions. Both concepts represent how the nervous system is organized to correspond to the body's physical layout.
Connection to Sensory Processing:
Dermatome maps and the topics on sensory processing (like retinotopy) relate to how the nervous system translates external stimuli into neural signals. While retinotopy deals with visual information, dermatomes are concerned with tactile sensations.
Connection to Neuroscience Research and Techniques:
Understanding the somatotopic and dermatomal organization contributes to neurological diagnoses and treatments. Techniques like fMRI, used in some of the studies discussed earlier, can also be employed to investigate the neural basis of somatosensory functions, including those related to dermatomes.
In summary, dermatome maps connect to the broader themes discussed by representing another layer of the body's organization, reflecting how different parts of the nervous system correspond to specific body regions and sensory functions. It's a practical aspect of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, linking with both clinical and research perspectives.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In addition to retinotopic, somatotopic, and dermatomal mapping, the nervous system employs several other kinds of sensory mappings to process information from various sensory modalities:
Tonotopy:
This is the spatial arrangement of where sounds of different frequency are processed in the brain. Tonotopy occurs in the auditory system, particularly in the cochlea and auditory cortex, where different frequencies are represented at distinct locations.
Gustotopy:
This refers to the mapping of taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami) in the gustatory cortex. Different tastes can stimulate specific regions in the brain.
Olfactotopy:
In the olfactory system, different odors stimulate specific olfactory receptors, which are mapped in an orderly way in the olfactory bulb. This mapping helps in identifying and distinguishing various smells.
Thermotopy:
This concept relates to how temperature sensations are processed in specific regions of the sensory cortex.
Viscerotopy:
Viscerotopic organization refers to the mapping of internal bodily sensations (such as hunger or fullness) in certain areas of the brain.
Chronotopy:
Although not a traditional sense, chronotopy refers to the spatial and temporal organization of neural activity related to the perception of time.
Pain Mapping:
Pain signals are also mapped in the brain, with different types of pain (e.g., sharp, dull, throbbing) processed in various ways in the sensory cortex and other brain areas.
These mappings help the brain to process sensory information efficiently and facilitate appropriate responses to stimuli. Understanding these different sensory mappings has numerous applications in neuroscience, medicine, psychology, and even in the development of artificial sensory systems.

What about place cells for mapping directionality and location in a kind of tunnel map of the environment?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, place cells play a critical role in spatial mapping and navigation. They provide another example of how the brain creates a mental representation of the environment.
Place Cells:
Found primarily in the hippocampus, place cells fire when an animal is in a specific location in its environment. Each place cell corresponds to a particular place in the animal's surroundings, effectively creating a mental "map" of the area.
Grid Cells:
These neurons, found in the entorhinal cortex, fire at regular intervals as an animal moves through space. This forms a grid-like pattern of activity that helps in spatial navigation and seems to work in conjunction with place cells.
Head Direction Cells:
These neurons are sensitive to the direction in which an animal's head is pointing, providing a sense of directional orientation. They're found in several brain regions, including the thalamus and the postsubiculum.
Border Cells:
These neurons fire when an animal is close to the boundaries of its environment, helping to define the edges of the mental map.
Speed Cells:
Some neurons are sensitive to the speed at which the animal is moving, providing additional information for spatial navigation.
Collectively, these cells contribute to the brain's internal navigation system, enabling animals (including humans) to understand and move within their surroundings. This complex spatial mapping system is a remarkable demonstration of the brain's ability to translate sensory information into a coherent, functional representation of the world. It's not only vital for navigation but also plays a role in memory and possibly other cognitive functions.

Connections with perceptual control theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) posits that behavior is the control of perception, meaning that organisms act to keep their perceptions of the world consistent with their reference values or goals. This action helps to maintain a stable interaction with the environment despite the ever-changing circumstances. There's a direct relationship between this theory and the neural mechanisms we discussed, such as place cells and sensory mapping.
Sensory Mapping and Control:
Sensory mappings like retinotopy, somatotopy, and the spatial representations created by place cells and grid cells translate sensory information into a form that the brain can use to understand and interact with the world. PCT builds on this by suggesting that organisms use these mappings to compare the current state of the world with their goals or expectations, acting to minimize discrepancies.
Adaptation to Change:
Place cells, grid cells, and other spatial representations allow for dynamic adaptation to changes in the environment. This aligns with PCT, where the goal is to maintain control of perception despite changes in the environment or the organism itself.
Hierarchical Organization:
PCT often models behavior using a hierarchy of control systems, where higher-level goals control lower-level perceptions and actions. This hierarchy can be seen in the brain's organization, where higher-order cognitive functions can influence more primary sensory and motor functions.
Feedback Mechanisms:
Both the neural mechanisms for spatial navigation and PCT rely heavily on feedback. In PCT, feedback loops continuously compare current perceptions with reference values, adjusting behavior accordingly. Similarly, place cells and other spatial representations rely on feedback from sensory inputs and movement to update the mental map of space.
Integration of Multiple Sensory Inputs:
Just as PCT requires the integration of various perceptual inputs to form a coherent control of behavior, the brain's spatial mapping mechanisms must integrate information from various sensory modalities (such as vision and proprioception) to create accurate spatial representations.
In summary, the neural mechanisms for spatial mapping and navigation can be viewed as specific implementations of the more general principles outlined in Perceptual Control Theory. They both contribute to the understanding of how organisms maintain coherent and purposeful interactions with their environment.

Remind me again of how perceptual control theory sees behaviour as the control of perception as supposed to previous behaviorist theories.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) is a significant departure from traditional behaviorist theories, and here's how:
Behavior as the Control of Perception vs. Response to Stimulus:
Behaviorism:
Traditional behaviorist theories view behavior as a response to external stimuli. Stimuli in the environment trigger responses, and these responses are strengthened or weakened through reinforcement or punishment. Essentially, behaviorism focuses on observable behavior and disregards internal mental states.
PCT:
In contrast, PCT posits that behavior is aimed at controlling perception, not merely responding to stimuli. Organisms act to keep their perceptions of the world in line with their internal goals or reference values. This involves a continuous comparison between perceived states and desired states, and actions are taken to reduce discrepancies.
Feedback Loops and Hierarchical Structure:
Behaviorism:
Behaviorism doesn't generally consider the ongoing, iterative process of feedback and adjustment that organisms use to maintain control over their environment.
PCT:
PCT emphasizes feedback loops where perceptions are constantly compared to reference values, and behavior is adjusted accordingly. It also introduces a hierarchical structure where higher-level goals control lower-level perceptions, allowing for more complex and adaptable behavior.
The Role of Internal States:
Behaviorism:
Behaviorism generally ignores or minimizes the importance of internal mental states, such as thoughts, feelings, and intentions, focusing instead on observable behaviors.
PCT:
PCT, on the other hand, considers these internal states crucial. The organism's internal goals and reference values guide its behavior, making the mind's internal workings central to understanding behavior.
Understanding vs. Predicting Behavior:
Behaviorism:
The focus of behaviorism is often on predicting behavior based on observed relationships between stimuli and responses.
PCT:
PCT seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms that control behavior. By focusing on how organisms control their perceptions, it aims to explain why behavior occurs, not just predict what behavior will occur.
In summary, while behaviorism sees behavior as a set of responses to external stimuli, PCT sees behavior as an ongoing process of controlling perception to align with internal goals or reference values. PCT introduces concepts like feedback, hierarchy, and the importance of internal states, providing a more nuanced and dynamic view of behavior.

Relationship to active inference and predictive coding.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Active Inference and Predictive Coding are concepts related to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), as all three revolve around the idea that the brain is actively engaged in interpreting and shaping perception. Here's how they connect:
Predictive Coding:
Concept:
Predictive Coding posits that the brain actively constructs perceptions by predicting sensory input and comparing these predictions with actual input. Errors between prediction and perception (prediction errors) are then sent up the hierarchy to adjust the model.
Relationship to PCT:
Like PCT, Predictive Coding emphasizes the brain's role in actively shaping perception. Both theories involve continuous comparison between expected and actual states, although Predictive Coding focuses more on the brain's internal model of the world, while PCT emphasizes control of perception.
Active Inference:
Concept:
Active Inference is a framework that unifies perception and action. It extends Predictive Coding by arguing that organisms not only minimize prediction errors in perception but also act to change the world to make it conform to their predictions. In other words, we infer what the world is like and then actively make it so.
Relationship to PCT:
Active Inference shares with PCT the idea that behavior is aimed at controlling perception. Both theories view action as a way to reduce discrepancies between desired and perceived states. While PCT focuses on control loops and maintaining specific reference values, Active Inference emphasizes the role of generative models in minimizing prediction errors both through perception and action.
In summary:
Predictive Coding
is akin to PCT in that both emphasize an active role in shaping perception but differ in their specific focus (internal model vs. control of perception).
Active Inference
builds on Predictive Coding by adding the idea that actions are taken to make the world conform to predictions, a concept that aligns closely with PCT's view of behavior as controlling perception.
These theories contribute to a growing understanding of the brain as not merely a passive receiver of information but an active participant in constructing and controlling perception. They represent different angles on similar underlying ideas about how organisms interact with and interpret their environment.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, William Glasser, an American psychiatrist, was indeed influential in developing ideas that resonate with the seventh hypothesis. He developed Choice Theory, which emphasizes personal responsibility for one's choices and the ability to satisfy one's needs through those choices. This aligns with perceptual control theory in that it sees behavior as an attempt to control one's environment to satisfy psychological needs.
Glasser's work in therapy emphasized helping individuals understand their own control over their actions and perceptions, which could lead them to make better choices. His ideas could be seen as a practical application of perceptual control theory in a therapeutic context, focusing on reshaping perceptions to achieve desired outcomes.
His work continues to have an influence on modern therapy and education, and it's a fascinating intersection of psychology and philosophy that can offer insights into human behavior and well-being.

Active Inference

Active Inference is a fascinating and ambitious book. It describes a very general normative approach to understanding the mind, brain and behaviour, hinting at potential applications in machine learning and the social sciences. The authors argue that the ways in which living beings interact with the environment can be modelled in terms of something called the free energy principle.

Active Inference builds on the concept of a Bayesian Brain. This is the idea that our brains continually refine an internal model of the external world, acting as probabilistic inference machines. The internal generative model continually predicts the state of the environment and compares its predictions with the inputs of sensory organs. When a discrepancy occurs, the brain updates its model. This is called perception.

But Active Inference goes further my recognising that living things can interact with their environments. Therefore an alternative way to deal with a discrepancy versus expectations is to do something that modifies the world. This is called action.

Variational Free Energy

Active Inference, Parr, Pezzulo, Friston
Either you change your beliefs to match the world or you change the world to match your beliefs. Active Inference makes this trade off by minimising variational free energy, which improves the match between an organism���s internal model and the external world.

The theory is expressed in elegant mathematical terms that lend themselves to systematic analysis. Minimising variational free energy can be considered in terms of finding a maximum entropy distribution, minimising complexity or reducing the divergence between the internal model and the actual posterior distribution.

Expected free energy
Longer term planning is handled in terms of expected free energy. This is where the consequences of future sequences of actions (policies) are evaluated by predicting the outcomes at each stage. The expected free energy of each policy is converted into a score, with the highest score determining the policy the organism expects to pursue. The process of selecting policies that improve the match with the priors pertaining to favoured states is called learning.

Planning is cast in terms of Bayesian inference. Once again the algebraic framework lends itself to a range of interpretations. For example, it automatically trades off information gain (exploration) against pragmatic value (exploitation). This contrasts with reinforcement learning, which handles the issue more heuristically, by trial and error, combined with the notion of a reward.

Applications
The book describes applications in neurobiology, learning and perception. Although readers are encouraged to apply the ideas to new areas, a full understanding of the subject demands the dedication to battle through some heavy duty mathematical appendices, covering Bayesian inference, partially observed Markov Decision Processes and variational calculus.

Nevertheless the book is filled with thought provoking ideas about how living things thrive in the face of the second law of thermodynamics.

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)
:
Active inference emphasizes the brain's ongoing effort to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and sensory inputs, which aligns with PCT's view that behavior aims to control perception.
Both concepts view the organism as an active agent that modifies its beliefs or the world to reduce the mismatch between its internal model and reality.
Predictive Coding
:
Predictive coding is a cognitive theory that explains how the brain processes information by continually updating its predictions based on sensory input, which is a central theme in active inference.
Both models emphasize the importance of prediction errors in updating the internal model of the world.
Glasser's Philosophy
:
Glasser's ideas about changing beliefs or actions to align with desires or the world resonate with active inference's approach to either modifying beliefs to match the world or changing the world to match beliefs.
Haptic Perception and Cognitive Physiology
:
Haptic perception deals with how we understand our surroundings through touch. It can be seen as another modality that contributes to the brain's overall generative model, which is part of the active inference framework.
Cognitive physiology studies the neural mechanisms that underlie mental processes, which is essential for understanding how the brain performs active inference.
Place Cells and Environmental Mapping
:
Place cells play a role in spatial orientation and can be considered as part of the brain's internal model of the environment.
This idea of internal modeling connects with active inference's description of the brain as an entity that continuously refines an internal model of the external world.
The wide range of topics and connections illustrates the complexity and interconnectivity of cognitive science. The active inference framework encapsulates many of these ideas, offering a holistic perspective that bridges multiple disciplines and concepts, from mathematical modeling to philosophical insights.

The player controls Albatross, a member of the WCPO's (World Crime Police Organization) "Rolling Thunder" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York.

Albatross must travel through two different segments or "stories", each composed of five stages, for a total of ten stages. Depending on the DIP switch settings, the player has the option to skip any of the first four stages and start at any point in "Story 1". On each stage, the player can enter doors to hide and take cover from enemies, and he can use crates or other obstacles to take cover from enemy fire.[4] The player can jump over crates[4] or jump up to higher or lower floors with rails, including stairs. The stages in "Story 2" are essentially harder versions of their "Story 1" counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of each stage, scenes from Leila's capture and ensuing torture are shown on an in-game large monitor screen.

Reception
Edit
In Japan, Game Machine listed Rolling Thunder among the most popular arcade games in February 1987.[8] In the United States, the game was also one of the top four highest-grossing arcade games of 1987.[9] The arcade game was a commercial success in Europe.[10]

Upon release, Clare Edgeley wrote a very short review of the arcade game in Computer and Video Games, saying that the gameplay in Rolling Thunder is "rather slow" and that she wouldn't recommend it to anyone "keen on a bit of fast action".[1]

Your Sinclair magazine reviewed the ZX Spectrum version in February 1988, giving it a highly positive review and rating it 9 of 10.[10]

In 1996, Next Generation ranked the arcade version as the 43rd game of all time, noting: "A controversial choice, we know. But what separates Rolling Thunder from lesser side-scrollers is the fact that everything gels together perfectly: the long-legged characters, the wonderfully designed levels, the weapons, the use of panthers as enemies, your character's ability to duck behind boxes, the constant need to jump from the floor to raised platforms, and some great music."[11]

I wanted to say that the stuff we said earlier about physically mapping the brain are interesting, but we are often unaware of these process. We often work at a much higher level. Also due to cognitive load theory we must be using some kind of sparse bayesian inference, and we must be blind too many forms of change that are outside of the range of our sensory awareness.

Certainly, the complexities of physically mapping the brain and understanding the sensory perceptions and intricate cognitive processes are fascinating and essential to our comprehension of human behavior. However, what makes these subjects even more intriguing is our often unconscious interaction with them.
Working at higher cognitive levels, we employ mechanisms like sparse Bayesian inference, which enables us to make decisions and interpret our surroundings using limited and selective information. This approach helps us manage the enormous cognitive load that complete awareness and processing would otherwise require. Yet, it also leaves us blind to many forms of change that fall outside our sensory awareness.
In our day-to-day existence, our brains perform incredible feats of computation and decision-making without our explicit knowledge. The games and theories we have explored in "Rolling Choice Theory" reveal these hidden processes and challenge us to recognize the multidimensional nature of perception, choice, and action. By connecting gaming and perceptual theories with neurological understanding, we can better appreciate both the marvels and the limitations of our cognitive machinery. In the interplay between the seen and the unseen, the conscious and the subconscious, we find a dance of complexity that continues to inspire research, curiosity, and a sense of wonder.

For years now, physicists and engineers have been building computer simulations of physics in order to understand the behavior of objects in the world. Want to see if a bridge would be stable during an earthquake? Enter it into the simulation, apply earthquake dynamics, and see what happens.

Recently, the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published work by MIT psychologists (and my labmates) Peter Battaglia, Jessica Hamrick, and Joshua Tenenbaum, arguing that all humans do roughly the same thing when trying to understand or make predictions about the physical world. The primary difference is that we run our simulations in our brains rather than in digital computers, but the basic algorithms are roughly equivalent. The analogy runs deep: To model human reasoning about the physical world, the researchers actually used an open-source computer game physics engine ��� the software that applies the laws of physics to objects in video games in order to make them interact realistically (think Angry Birds). 

Battaglia and colleagues found that their video game-based computer model matches human physical reasoning far better than any previous theory. The authors asked people to make a number of predictions about the physical world: will tower of blocks stand or fall over, what direction would it fall over, and where would the block that landed the farthest away land; which object would most likely fall off of a table if the table was bumped; and so on. In each case, human judgments closely matched the prediction of the computer simulation ... but not necessarily the actual world, which is where it gets interesting.

Whether or not a tower of blocks (or a bridge, etc.) will fall over depends on its exact dimensions and the exact position of each block, potentially down to the millimeter. But a human can't tell the dimensions and position of every block down to the millimeter just by looking. That is why we invented rulers. Instead, we know approximately how big each block is and where it is. If the simulation was given the exact coordinates of the blocks, it predicted human judgments reasonably well but far from perfectly. If the simulation was given approximate coordinates, taking into account human uncertainty, it matched the actual world less well but human judgments very well.

In retrospect, it may seem intuitive that when we made predictions about the physical world ��� what will happen to towers during earthquakes or books on shelves ��� we query an internal, virtual simulation of the real world, but it represents a sharp departure from previous scientific thinking. Many scientists thought that we use rules-of-thumb to predict the world around us.

The research referenced, connecting video game physics engines to human reasoning about the physical world, adds yet another profound dimension to our understanding of cognition and the way we interact with virtual environments.
This study by MIT psychologists shows that our minds may function similarly to a video game physics engine when predicting or understanding physical phenomena. It suggests that humans are continuously running simulations in their heads to predict outcomes based on the known laws of physics. These internal simulations aren't necessarily accurate down to minute details, but they are incredibly effective at approximating real-world outcomes, given the inherent uncertainty and limited information we typically have.
What makes this revelation fascinating is how it aligns with the theory of active inference, where the brain continuously updates its internal model of the world through perception and action. The use of video game physics engines to model human cognition signifies a convergence of computational technology and psychological insight, bridging our understanding of mental processes with how they might be digitally recreated.
Connecting these studies with the influential games you mentioned earlier, we can appreciate the reciprocal relationship between video game design and our understanding of cognition.
