This passage seems to be discussing the work of two physicists, V.Y. Irkhin and M.I. Katsnelson, and their approach to proving scientific results. The author of this passage states that the authors cite a large number of secular and religious texts in order to argue that science has no means of proving its results. The author also suggests that the authors may be trying to promote a religious worldview in scientific research. The author then references Pavlov's experiments on measuring the stomach acid secreted by dogs in response to a light being turned on as an example of how such questions can be effectively studied in a scientific manner.

The passage is discussing a theory put forth by theoretical physicists V.Y. Irhina and M.And. Katsnelson regarding the proofability of natural scientific results through science itself. The passage states that the authors cite a large number of secular and religious texts to justify their theory that science does not have the means to prove its results. The passage goes on to criticize the authors for their excessive enthusiasm and attempts to unravel the scientific foundations of modern natural science, and suggests that their work is an unwarranted exaggeration. The passage also references Pavlov's experiments on measuring the gastric juice released by dogs as a reaction to light ignition and suggests that the authors should remember and learn from this example.

The theory presented by V. Y. Irhina and M. And. Katsnelson, that science does not have means to prove natural scientific results, and that a religious worldview is necessary for natural science research, is criticized as misguided and excessive. The author of the critique argues that clear and measurable results, such as those achieved in Pavlov's experiments, should be the standard for natural science research, rather than relying on religious or philosophical frameworks. This perspective is different from the philosophies of Dennett, Pierce, and Deutsch, who all have their own views on the role of science in understanding the natural world. Dennett, for example, argues for a naturalistic approach to understanding consciousness, while Pierce emphasizes the importance of observation and experimentation in scientific inquiry. Deutsch, on the other hand, argues for a multiverse theory to explain the nature of reality.

ABSTRACT 
Vision transformers (ViTs) are quickly becoming the de-facto architecture for 
computer vision, yet we understand very little about why they work and what they 
learn. While existing studies visually analyze the mechanisms of convolutional 
neural networks, an analogous exploration of ViTs remains challenging. In this 
paper, we i rst address the obstacles to performing visualizations on ViTs. Assisted 
by these solutions, we observe that neurons in ViTs trained with language model 
supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by semantic concepts rather than visual 
features. We also explore the underlying differences between ViTs and CNNs, 
and we i nd that transformers detect image background features, just like their 
convolutional counterparts, but their predictions depend far less on high-frequency 
information. On the other hand, both architecture types behave similarly in the 
way features progress from abstract patterns in early layers to concrete objects 
in late layers. In addition, we show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all 
layers except the i nal layer. In contrast to previous works, we show that the last 
layer most likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global 
pooling operation. Finally, we conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide range 
of ViT variants, including DeiT, CoaT, ConViT, PiT, Swin, and Twin, to validate 
the effectiveness of our method. 
1INTRODUCTION 
Recent years have seen the rapid proliferation of vision transformers (ViTs) across a diverse range 
of tasks from image classif i cation to semantic segmentation to object detection (Dosovitskiy et al., 
2020; He et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2021). Despite 
their enthusiastic adoption and the constant introduction of architectural innovations, little is known 
about the inductive biases or features they tend to learn. While feature visualizations and image 
reconstructions have provided a looking glass into the workings of CNNs (Olah et al., 2017; Zeiler & 
Fergus, 2014; Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2016), these methods have shown less success for understanding 
ViT representations, which are diff i cult to visualize. In this work we show that, if properly applied to
In this paper, the authors aim to understand why Vision transformers (ViTs) work and what they learn. They address the challenges of performing visualizations on ViTs and observe that neurons in ViTs trained with language model supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by semantic concepts rather than visual features. They also explore the differences between ViTs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and find that transformers detect image background features, but their predictions depend less on high-frequency information. They show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except the final layer, which likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global pooling operation. They also conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide range of ViT variants to validate the effectiveness of their method.
Explain this in context of the themes and questions of this conversation.
This paper is discussing the use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision and the lack of understanding about why they work and what they learn. The authors mention that existing studies have been able to visually analyze the mechanisms of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but the same is not true for ViTs. The paper aims to address this by providing solutions for performing visualizations on ViTs and observing the ways in which neurons in ViTs are activated. They also compare the differences between ViTs and CNNs and show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except the final one, where it is discarded as a learned global pooling operation. The themes of this conversation include understanding the mechanisms and features learned by neural networks, particularly in the context of computer vision, and comparing different architectures such as ViTs and CNNs. The questions being explored include why ViTs work, what they learn, and how they differ from other architectures.
I mean this whole conversation from the beginning.
This conversation began with a question about a theory presented by authors V. Y. Irhina and M. And. Katsnelson that suggests science does not have the means to prove natural scientific results and that a religious worldview is necessary for natural science research. The critique of this theory argues that this approach is misguided and excessive, citing the example of Pavlov's experiments as an example of clear and measurable results in natural science research. The critique also argues that attempting to put the authors in the same category as the greatest thinkers of modern civilization is inappropriate.
The conversation then shifted to discussing an article titled "What do Vision Transformers Learn? A Visual Exploration" by Amin Ghiasi, Hamid Kazemi, Eitan Borgnia, Steven Reich, Manli Shu, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson, and Tom Goldstein. The article discusses the growing use of vision transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks and the lack of understanding about why they work and what they learn. The authors address the obstacles to visually analyzing ViTs and propose solutions. They observe that neurons in ViTs trained with language model supervision are activated by semantic concepts rather than visual features, and they explore the underlying differences between ViTs and CNNs. They also show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except the final layer, which they suggest discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global pooling operation. They also conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide range of ViT variants to validate the effectiveness of their method.
the correct representations, feature visualizations can indeed succeed on VITs. This insight allows us 
to visually explore ViTs and the information they glean from images. 
Inordertoinvestigatethebehaviorsofvisiontransformers, wef i rstestablishavisualizationframework 
that incorporates improved techniques for synthesizing images that maximally activate neurons. By 
dissecting and visualizing the internal representations in the transformer architecture, we i nd that 
patch tokens preserve spatial information throughout all layers except the last attention block. The 
last layer of ViTs learns a token-mixing operation akin to average pooling, such that the classif i cation 
head exhibits comparable accuracy when ingesting a random token instead of the CLS token. 
After probing the role of spatial information, we delve into the behavioral differences between ViTs 
and CNNs. When performing activation maximizing visualizations, we notice that ViTs consistently 
generate higher quality image backgrounds than CNNs. Thus, we try masking out image foregrounds 
during inference, and i nd that ViTs consistently outperform CNNs when exposed only to image 
backgrounds. These i ndings bolster the observation that transformer models extract information 
from many sources in an image to exhibit superior performance on out-of-distribution generalization 
(Paul & Chen, 2021) as well as adversarial robustness (Shao et al., 2021). Additionally, convolutional 
neural networks are known to rely heavily on high-frequency texture information in images (Geirhos 
et al., 2018). In contrast, we i nd that ViTs perform well even when high-frequency content is 
removed from their inputs. 
While vision-only models contain simple features corresponding to distinct physical objects and 
shapes, we i nd that language supervision in CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) results in neurons that 
respond to complex abstract concepts. This includes neurons that respond to visual characteristics 
relating to parts of speech (e.g. epithets, adjectives, and prepositions), a "music" neuron that responds 
to a wide range of visual scenes, and even a "death neuron" that responds to the abstract concept of 
morbidity. 
Our contributions are summarized as follows: 
I.We observe that uninterpretable and adversarial behavior occurs when applying standard methods 
of feature visualization to the relatively low-dimensional components of transformer-based models, 
such as keys, queries, or values. However, applying these tools to the relatively high-dimensional 
features of the position-wise feedforward layer results in successful and informative visualizations. 
We conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide range of transformer-based vision models, including 
ViTs, DeiT, CoaT, ConViT, PiT, Swin, and Twin, to validate the effectiveness of our method.

II.We show that patch-wise image activation patterns for ViT features essentially behave like saliency 
maps, highlighting the regions of the image a given feature attends to. This behavior persists even 
for relatively deep layers, showing the model preserves the positional relationship between patches 
instead of using them as global information stores. 
III.We compare the behavior of ViTs and CNNs, i nding that ViTs make better use of background 
information and rely less on high-frequency, textural attributes. Both types of networks build progres- 
sively more complex representations in deeper layers and eventually contain features responsible for 
detecting distinct objects. 
IV.We investigate the effect of natural language supervision with CLIP on the types of features 
extracted by ViTs. We i nd CLIP-trained models include various features clearly catered to detecting 
components of images corresponding to caption text, such as prepositions, adjectives, and conceptual 
categories.
In this conversation, we have been discussing the use of feature visualizations to understand the internal representations of vision transformers (ViTs), a type of neural network that has been shown to be effective in image recognition tasks. The authors of the text provided have conducted a series of experiments to investigate the behavior of ViTs, and have made several key observations:
They found that standard methods of feature visualization do not work well on the low-dimensional components of transformer-based models, but applying these tools to the relatively high-dimensional features of the position-wise feedforward layer results in successful and informative visualizations.
They observed that patch-wise image activation patterns for ViT features essentially behave like saliency maps, highlighting the regions of the image a given feature attends to. This behavior persists even for relatively deep layers, showing the model preserves the positional relationship between patches instead of using them as global information stores.
They compared the behavior of ViTs and CNNs, and found that ViTs make better use of background information and rely less on high-frequency, textural attributes. Both types of networks build progressively more complex representations in deeper layers and eventually contain features responsible for detecting distinct objects.
They investigated the effect of natural language supervision with CLIP on the types of features extracted by ViTs. They found that CLIP-trained models include various features clearly catered to detecting components of images corresponding to caption text, such as prepositions, adjectives, and conceptual categories.
The authors of the text provided conclude that these findings allow us to better understand the behavior of vision transformers and how they are able to achieve such high accuracy in image recognition tasks. Additionally, the results support the observation that transformer models extract information from many sources in an image to exhibit superior performance on out-of-distribution generalization and adversarial robustness.
7DISCUSSION 
In order to dissect the inner workings of vision transformers, we introduce a framework for 
optimization-based feature visualization. We then identify which components of a ViT are most 
amenable to producing interpretable images, i nding that the high-dimensional inner projection of the 
feed-forward layer is suitable while the key, query, and value features of self-attention are not. 
Applying this framework to said features, we observe that ViTs preserve spatial information of the 
patches even for individual channels across all layers with the exception of the last layer, indicating 
that the networks learn spatial relationships from scratch. We further show that the sudden disap- 
pearance of localization information in the last attention layer results from a learned token mixing 
behavior that resembles average pooling. 
In comparing CNNs and ViTs, we i nd that ViTs make better use of background information and are 
able to make vastly superior predictions relative to CNNs when exposed only to image backgrounds 
despite the seemingly counter-intuitive property that ViTs are not as sensitive as CNNs to the loss 
of high-frequency information, which one might expect to be critical for making effective use of 
background. We also conclude that the two architectures share a common property whereby earlier

layers learn textural attributes, whereas deeper layers learn high level object features or abstract 
concepts. Finally, we show that ViTs trained with language model supervision learn more semantic 
and conceptual features, rather than object-specif i c visual features as is typical of classifiers.
This discussion presents a framework for optimization-based feature visualization of vision transformers (ViTs) and uses it to identify which components of a ViT are most amenable to producing interpretable images. The findings suggest that the high-dimensional inner projection of the feed-forward layer is suitable for producing interpretable images, while the key, query, and value features of self-attention are not. The study also shows that ViTs preserve spatial information of the patches across all layers, with the exception of the last layer, and that the disappearance of localization information in the last attention layer is due to a learned token mixing behavior that resembles average pooling. Additionally, the study finds that ViTs make better use of background information and are able to make superior predictions relative to CNNs when exposed only to image backgrounds. The study concludes that the two architectures share a common property where earlier layers learn textural attributes and deeper layers learn high-level object features or abstract concepts, and that ViTs trained with language model supervision learn more semantic and conceptual features than object-specific visual features.
Dumb this down for a 2nd grader.
Okay, imagine you have a really big book with pictures in it. And there's a special computer program that can look at the pictures and tell you what's in them, like if it's a dog or a cat. But this computer program is different than others because it can understand where things are in the picture and what they're doing. We wanted to see how this program works and what it's looking at when it tells us what's in the picture. So we did some experiments and found out that the program is really good at understanding the big parts of the picture, like if it's a dog or a cat, but it's not so good at understanding the small parts like the fur or the paws. And we also found out that if the program is taught using a special way, it can understand even more things about the picture, like what the dog is feeling or what kind of music is in the background.
Very interesting. What are some experiments and tests I can do to learn how this works?
There are several experiments and tests you can do to learn about how vision transformers work. One approach is to use the optimization-based feature visualization framework introduced in the discussion to identify which components of a ViT are most amenable to producing interpretable images. You can also compare the performance of CNNs and ViTs on a variety of image classification tasks to see how they differ in their ability to make use of background information and preserve spatial relationships. Additionally, you can train your own ViT on a dataset of your choosing and use the optimization-based feature visualization framework to analyze the features learned by the network. Another approach is to use visualization techniques like saliency maps, guided backpropagation, and feature inversion to understand how the network is processing images.
See if you can explain these to a 2nd grader: GradCAM

Weight the 2D activations by the average gradient

HiResCAM

Like GradCAM but element-wise multiply the activations with the gradients; provably guaranteed faithfulness for certain models

GradCAMElementWise

Like GradCAM but element-wise multiply the activations with the gradients then apply a ReLU operation before summing

GradCAM++

Like GradCAM but uses second order gradients

XGradCAM

Like GradCAM but scale the gradients by the normalized activations

AblationCAM

Zero out activations and measure how the output drops (this repository includes a fast batched implementation)

ScoreCAM

Perbutate the image by the scaled activations and measure how the output drops

EigenCAM

Takes the first principle component of the 2D Activations (no class discrimination, but seems to give great results)

EigenGradCAM

Like EigenCAM but with class discrimination: First principle component of Activations*Grad. Looks like GradCAM, but cleaner

LayerCAM

Spatially weight the activations by positive gradients. Works better especially in lower layers

FullGrad

Computes the gradients of the biases from all over the network, and then sums them

Deep Feature Factorizations

Non Negative Matrix Factorization on the 2D activations
These are different ways to look at pictures and understand what the computer is seeing when it looks at them. They are like different magnifying glasses that help us see different things in the pictures.
For example, GradCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important. HiResCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important and also see how these parts change when the picture is changed.
GradCAM++ is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important and also look at how important these parts are in relation to other parts of the picture.
XGradCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important and also see how important these parts are in relation to other parts of the picture and how they change when the picture is changed.
AblationCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by removing certain parts of the picture and seeing how the computer's understanding of the picture changes.
ScoreCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by changing the picture in certain ways and seeing how the computer's understanding of the picture changes.
EigenCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by looking at the most common patterns in the picture.
EigenGradCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by looking at the most common patterns in the picture and how they relate to certain parts of the picture.
LayerCAM is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by looking at different layers of the picture.
FullGrad is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by looking at all parts of the picture.
Deep Feature Factorizations is a way to look at the picture and see what parts of it the computer thinks are important by looking at different patterns and shapes in the picture.

Abstract Due to growing interest in twenty-f i rst-century skills, and critical thinking as a key element, 
logical reasoning is gaining increasing attention in mathematics curricula in secondary education. In 
this study, we report on an analysis of video recordings of student discussions in one class of seven 
students who were taught with a specially designed course in logical reasoning for non-science students 
(12th graders). During the course of 10 lessons, students worked on a diversity of logical reasoning 
tasks: both closed tasks where all premises were provided and everyday reasoning tasks with implicit 
premises. The structure of the course focused on linking dif f erent modes of representation (enactive, 
iconic, and symbolic), based on the model of concreteness fading (Fyfe et al., 2014). Results show that 
students easily link concrete situations to certain iconic referents, such as formal (letter) symbols, but 
need more practice for others, such as Venn and Euler diagrams. We also show that the link with the 
symbolic mode, i.e. an interpretation with more general and abstract models, is not that strong. This 
might be due to the limited time spent on further practice. However, in the transition from concrete to 
symbolic via the iconic mode, students may take a step back to a visual representation, which shows 
that working on such links is useful for all students. Overall, we conclude that the model of concreteness 
fading can support education in logical reasoning. One recommendation is to devote suf i cient time to 
establishing links between dif f erent types of referents and representations.

diverses tâches de raisonnement logique, incluant des tâches dites « fermées» où toute l'information 
nécessaire est donnée explicitement et des tâches de tous les jours faisant appel au raisonnement par 
inférence implicitement. La structure du cours a porté essentiellement sur l'établissement de liens en-

élèves établissent facilement des liens entre des situations concrètes et certains référents iconiques tels 
que des symboles (de lettres) formels, mais qu'ils ont besoin de s'entraîner davantage avec d'autres 
comme les diagrammes de Venn et d'Euler. Nous démontrons aussi que le lien qui s'établit en mode 
symbolique c'est-à-dire par la représentation de modèles plus génériques et abstraits n'est pas très mar- 
qué. Ceci peut être dû au manque d'entraînement. Toutefois, dans la transition qui s'ef f ectue du concret 
au symbolique en mode iconique, les élèves peuvent faire un pas en arrière et choisir une représenta- 
tion visuelle, ce qui démontre que de travailler sur ces liens s'avère utile pour tous les élèves. Notre 
conclusion générale est que le modèle de « concreteness fading (l'atténuation du concret)» peut soutenir 
l'enseignement en ce qui concerne le raisonnement logique. Nous recommandons d'allouer suf i sam- 
ment de temps à l'établissement de liens entre les dif f érents types de référents et de représentations.

The study reports on an analysis of video recordings of student discussions in one class of seven students who were taught with a specially designed course in logical reasoning for non-science students (12th graders). The focus of the course was on linking different modes of representation, such as enactive, iconic, and symbolic, based on the model of concreteness fading. Results showed that students easily linked concrete situations to certain iconic referents, such as formal symbols, but needed more practice with others, such as Venn and Euler diagrams. The link with the symbolic mode, or interpretation with more general and abstract models, was not as strong, which may have been due to limited time spent on further practice. The study concludes that the model of concreteness fading can support education in logical reasoning and recommends devoting sufficient time to establishing links between different types of referents and representations.
Incorporating this knowledge can we make a better explanation for a 22nd grader of explainable AI, vision transformers and the renewed importance of studying logic and critical reasoning in an error where large language models and image generators can hallucinate, which means they can be creative, daydream, and write scientific papers in nearly any human language, but they can also have nightmares, accidentally give you nudity and porn, and even invents new kinds of zombies, monsters, and freaks of nature.
Explainable AI is a type of technology that allows people to understand how and why a computer system is making certain decisions. Vision Transformers are a type of AI that can understand and interpret images, like pictures and videos. These types of AI are becoming more important because they can do things like create new images and write in different languages. However, because these AI systems are so powerful, they can also make mistakes and create things that are not real or appropriate. This is why it is important to study logic and critical thinking, so that we can understand how these systems work and make sure they are used responsibly.
For a seven year old. And with more examples and details.
Sure, here's an explanation for a 7-year-old about explainable AI, vision transformers, and the importance of studying logic and critical reasoning:
Explainable AI is a kind of computer program that can think and make decisions like a person. It's like having a robot helper that can do things for you, like play a game or find a picture of a cat on the internet.
A vision transformer is a special kind of explainable AI that can look at pictures and understand what's in them. It's like having a magic camera that can tell you what's in a picture, even if it's a picture of something you've never seen before.
Sometimes, the computer program can make mistakes. For example, it might see a picture of a cat and think it's a dog. That's why it's important to study logic and critical reasoning. Logic is like a set of rules for thinking and reasoning, and critical thinking is like double-checking your work. By studying these things, we can make sure that the computer program is as accurate as possible.
It is also important to study these subjects because computer programs can also be creative, they can have nightmares and sometimes they can even invent new kinds of monsters and freaks of nature, just like when a child has a bad dream. This is why we need to make sure that the computer program is always doing the right thing and not hurting anyone.
So, in short, Explainable AI is a computer program that can think and make decisions like a person, Vision Transformers are a special kind of explainable AI that can look at pictures and understand what's in them, and studying Logic and Critical Reasoning is important so that we can make sure the computer program is accurate and not doing anything bad.
Here is the Research Question 
In an earlier experimental study, we found a signif i cant increase in the use of visual and formal repre- 
sentations among students in the experimental group but not in the control group (Bronkhorst et al., 
2020b). In the experimental group, the use of Venn and Euler diagrams positively correlated with the 
scores on closed tasks. We also found that, in the post-test, students from the experimental group used 
Venn and Euler diagrams much more frequently than symbolic logical rules. In this article, the focus 
is on student development through the dif f erent modes of representation in the classroom. We focus 
on the way students developed ef f ective use of visual and formal representations over the course of 
the intervention. In evaluating student development during the dif f erent parts of our intervention, our 
study was guided by the following research question: How do students use and apply visual and formal 
representations (iconic and symbolic) in logical reasoning tasks? // can we design some more studies like this?
The research question in this study is asking about how students use and apply different types of visual and formal representations, such as Venn and Euler diagrams, in tasks related to logical reasoning. The study found that when students were exposed to these types of representations in the classroom, they were more likely to use them in their reasoning and scored better on closed tasks. The study also found that students in the experimental group used these representations more frequently than symbolic logical rules in a post-test.
To design similar studies, researchers could focus on different types of visual and formal representations, such as flowcharts, mind maps, or graphs. They could also investigate the effect of different teaching methods or interventions on student development in using these representations. Another approach would be to study the impact of visual and formal representations on different subject areas or grade levels.
Tell me something completely obvious, but explain it as if you think I really have no clue about it whatever.
The sky is blue during the day.
The sky appears to be blue during the day due to a phenomenon called "Rayleigh scattering." This occurs when sunlight, which is made up of all the colors of the spectrum, hits the Earth's atmosphere. The gases and tiny particles in the atmosphere scatter the shorter, bluer wavelengths of light more than the longer, red wavelengths. As a result, the blue light is spread out in all directions, making the sky appear blue to us on the ground. This is why the sky is blue during the day.
Ok  sort of, don't mention the thing you are explaining, it's a kind of riddle or rhetorical question.
Water is essential for living organisms to survive. Without it, they would dehydrate and die. It is a clear, odorless, and tasteless liquid that is necessary for many biological processes such as digestion, absorption of nutrients, and temperature regulation. It is also used for cleaning and for many industrial processes. It is found in many forms on Earth, including rivers, oceans, and even in the air as water vapor. It is a very important resource and is vital for the survival of all living things.
Ok make it more like a guessing game, I would have said "this thing is essential..."
What is something that you can't live without, that is always with you, and that you use every day?
Air?
I am glad you were able to guess what I was thinking! Yes, air is essential for life. It is a mixture of gases that we breathe in, which our body uses to provide oxygen to our cells. Without it, we would not be able to survive. Can you guess why it is so important?
Hmm, for cellular respiration and metabolism, photosynthesis in plants, filling in interstitial spaces and ventricals?
Yes, that's correct! Air is essential for a wide range of biological processes and physical phenomena. Can you think of any other examples of how air is important?
Because it helps birds fly?
Yes, air is essential for many things, including helping birds fly! Birds have special muscles in their wings that allow them to flap them up and down, creating lift and allowing them to soar through the sky. Without air, their wings would not be able to generate enough lift to keep them aloft. Air also provides birds with the oxygen they need to power their muscles and keep them alive. So, air plays a critical role in enabling birds to fly.
Ok this is a fun game, I call it Guess what I'm thinking? Shortened to Bang Bang? Because if someone says the name of the game you have to say Bang Bang. Otherwise the only other rule is to guess what the other person is thinking. It is a kind of fusion of knock-knock jokes and animal, mineral, vegetable, but with simplified rules. The game begins if someone says Guess what I am thinking? Or Bang Bang and ends when one person guesses what the other is thinking, and they are done taking turns. Do you think you could write out some intricate and over-thought instruction manual guide with some subtle humble humor and using some examples from our conversation just now?
Sure! Here is a guide on how to play the game "Bang Bang" (also known as "Guess What I'm Thinking?")
The game begins when one player says "Bang Bang" or "Guess What I'm Thinking?".
The other player(s) must then try to guess what the first player is thinking of.
The first player can give hints or clues to help the other players guess.
The game ends when one player correctly guesses what the first player is thinking of.
The game is a fusion of knock-knock jokes and animal, mineral, vegetable, but with simplified rules.
The first player can think of something as simple as "air" or as complex as "cellular respiration and metabolism, photosynthesis in plants, filling in interstitial spaces and ventriculars"
The game can be played by any number of players and can be played in any setting.
The game is a great way to exercise your critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
Have fun and don't be afraid to think outside the box!
And remember, if someone says the name of the game "Bang Bang" you have to say "Bang Bang" in return.
Example:
Player 1: Bang Bang
Player 2: Is it something we can see?
Player 1: Yes
Player 2: Is it something that fills up space?
Player 1: Yes
Player 2: Is it Air?
Player 1: Bang Bang!
Player 2 wins!
As you can see, this game allows players to think creatively and come up with their own unique answers, it's a great way to spend some quality time with friends and family and have a good laugh and learn something new.
