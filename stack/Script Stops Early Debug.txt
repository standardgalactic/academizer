Your script processes the directories in sequence, but it stops prematurely after processing only the first few directories. This is likely because of the
set -e
option in the script.
The
set -e
command causes the script to immediately exit if any command within the script returns a non-zero (error) status. In your case, if there is an issue with a command in any of the directories processed, the script will stop running without completing the loop. Some possible points where errors may occur include:
File copy command
(
cp -vu
): If there are no
.mhtml
,
.html
, or
.txt
files in a directory,
cp -vu
could throw an error, causing the script to stop.
Git commands
(
git add
,
git commit
,
git push
): If there's an issue with the Git repository, such as conflicts, missing permissions, or remote errors, the script will exit.
Non-existent directories
: If any directory in
directories
doesn���t exist, the
if [ -d "$full_path" ]; then
condition will pass over it with a message but may still be affected by
set -e
if
compgen
or
cp
is unable to proceed.
To troubleshoot, you can try:
Remove or modify
set -e
:** to allow the script to continue processing each directory even if one fails. Replace it with individual error checks for critical commands instead of halting on any failure.
Enable conditional checking
: Wrap critical commands in conditional statements to capture errors without stopping the script. For instance:
bash
Copiar c��digo
if
! git commit -m
"Imported files from
$dir
"
;
then
echo
"Git commit failed for
$dir
"
continue
fi
This approach allows the script to handle errors in each directory independently, ensuring that it continues processing through the entire list.

Here���s an improved version of your script that handles potential errors more gracefully and provides additional feedback while processing each directory. I���ve removed
set -e
to allow the script to continue processing each directory even if one fails, added more error checking, and provided conditional statements for critical commands.

Explanation of Changes:
Error Handling for Commands
: The
git commit
and
git push
commands are wrapped in
if
statements, allowing the script to print a message if they fail and to skip further actions for that directory.
Optional
cp
Error Suppression
: By adding
2>/dev/null
to
cp
, the script ignores errors if no new or updated files are found, reducing unnecessary error messages.
Continue on Error
: When a critical command fails (e.g.,
git commit
or
git push
),
continue
ensures the script skips to the next directory without stopping.
This should provide a more robust solution, allowing the script to handle directories individually and continue processing even if an error occurs in one.
