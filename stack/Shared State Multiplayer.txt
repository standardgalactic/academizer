Shared State Multiplayer
Model: Default (GPT-3.5)
I like this program but I want it to update the defaults as an exact position or timestamp of the statespace so that the same image will appear on all displays, even if only one player hits w it will appear on all screens, like a single shard universe.

It seems like you're describing a shared state concept in your program, where any action made by one player (like hitting the "w" key) is reflected across all instances of the game or program. This is a common feature in multiplayer online games or collaborative tools.
Here's a general strategy you could follow, depending on the specifics of your platform and programming language:
Server/Client architecture
: Set up a server/client architecture. The server maintains the current state of the program. Each client (player or user) connects to this server.
State Updates
: Whenever a client performs an action (like pressing 'w'), they send a message to the server with that action.
Broadcasting Updates
: The server then processes that action, updates the state of the program accordingly, and broadcasts the new state to all connected clients.
Reflecting Changes
: Each client receives the new state from the server and updates their local state to match. This causes the same image to appear on all screens, regardless of which client initiated the action.
Please note, this is just a basic strategy and you might need to adjust it to meet your specific needs, also considering the performance, security and the potential need for synchronization strategies to prevent inconsistencies. There are also a variety of libraries and frameworks available for different languages that can help with setting up this kind of system.
You'll also need to consider the networking aspect of this system. Depending on whether your program is intended to be used over the internet or on a local network, there may be additional considerations.
Lastly, it's important to consider the user experience of your program. Depending on how you implement this feature, it may be unexpected or disorienting for users if the program's state is constantly changing due to actions from other users. Make sure to keep your target users in mind and consider soliciting feedback to ensure this feature improves the program as intended.

The HTML/JavaScript code you've posted generates a 2D starfield animation on a webpage. The stars move towards or away from the center of the screen when the 'W' or 'S' keys are pressed, respectively.
If you want to make this work in a shared state as previously discussed, you'll need a server to store and broadcast the state. You could use Node.js and WebSocket for this purpose.
However, this solution requires setting up a backend server which may not be appropriate for your use case. If you're looking for a simpler solution, such as sharing the state across multiple tabs on the same machine, you could use the
localStorage
or
sessionStorage
APIs to achieve this. These APIs let you store data across different browser sessions or tabs.
Below is an example of how you could modify your keydown and keyup event listeners to use
localStorage
:
javascript
Copy code
document
.
addEventListener
(
"keydown"
,
function
(
event
) {
switch
(event.
key
) {
case
'w'
:
// W
forwardPressed =
1
;
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'forwardPressed'
,
'1'
);
break
;
case
's'
:
// S
backwardPressed =
1
;
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'backwardPressed'
,
'1'
);
break
;
    }
});
document
.
addEventListener
(
"keyup"
,
function
(
event
) {
switch
(event.
key
) {
case
'w'
:
// W
forwardPressed =
0
;
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'forwardPressed'
,
'0'
);
break
;
case
's'
:
// S
backwardPressed =
0
;
localStorage
.
setItem
(
'backwardPressed'
,
'0'
);
break
;
    }
});
// In your draw function, update the forwardPressed and backwardPressed values from localStorage
function
draw
(
) {
    forwardPressed =
Number
(
localStorage
.
getItem
(
'forwardPressed'
) ||
'0'
);
    backwardPressed =
Number
(
localStorage
.
getItem
(
'backwardPressed'
) ||
'0'
);
// rest of your draw code...
}
In this version, whenever a key is pressed or released, the event listeners update the values of
forwardPressed
and
backwardPressed
in
localStorage
. Then, in the
draw
function, we get those values from
localStorage
and use them to adjust the speed of the stars. Since
localStorage
is shared across all tabs in the same browser, pressing a key in one tab will affect the animation in all tabs.
Please note that
localStorage
can only store strings, so we need to store our
forwardPressed
and
backwardPressed
values as strings and convert them back to numbers when we retrieve them.
This approach only works on the same machine and same browser. For a truly shared state across different machines, you would need a backend server.

Well I wonder if there is a simpler way maybe the could both use a shortcut to point to a central template.

A solution with a centralized template would involve using a form of shared storage or state that can be accessed from both instances of your application. One approach could be using a database, but this would require server-side infrastructure and might not be the simplest solution.
A more direct approach might involve using a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. You could save your state (in this case,
forwardPressed
and
backwardPressed
) as a file in the shared folder, and have each instance of your application read that file to update its state. This approach, however, would involve dealing with APIs of these services and might not provide real-time updates.
For the simplest possible real-time solution, you might consider using a service like Firebase, which is a cloud-based NoSQL database that can provide real-time updates to clients. This allows all connected clients to stay in sync with the shared state. The Firebase JavaScript SDK can be included in your HTML page, and you could read and write to the shared state just like you would with a local variable. Here's how you might adapt your code to use Firebase:
javascript
Copy code
// Initialize Firebase
var
config = {
// Your Firebase configuration here
};
firebase.
initializeApp
(config);
var
database = firebase.
database
();
// Handle keyboard input
var
forwardPressed =
0
;
var
backwardPressed =
0
;
document
.
addEventListener
(
"keydown"
,
function
(
event
) {
switch
(event.
key
) {
case
'w'
:
// W
forwardPressed =
1
;
            database.
ref
(
'/forwardPressed'
).
set
(
1
);
break
;
case
's'
:
// S
backwardPressed =
1
;
            database.
ref
(
'/backwardPressed'
).
set
(
1
);
break
;
    }
});
document
.
addEventListener
(
"keyup"
,
function
(
event
) {
switch
(event.
key
) {
case
'w'
:
// W
forwardPressed =
0
;
            database.
ref
(
'/forwardPressed'
).
set
(
0
);
break
;
case
's'
:
// S
backwardPressed =
0
;
            database.
ref
(
'/backwardPressed'
).
set
(
0
);
break
;
    }
});
// Monitor changes in the database
database.
ref
(
'/forwardPressed'
).
on
(
'value'
,
function
(
snapshot
) {
    forwardPressed = snapshot.
val
();
});
database.
ref
(
'/backwardPressed'
).
on
(
'value'
,
function
(
snapshot
) {
    backwardPressed = snapshot.
val
();
});
// Rest of your code...
In this version, whenever a key is pressed or released, the event listeners update the values of
forwardPressed
and
backwardPressed
in the Firebase database. The
on('value', callback)
method then triggers the callback function every time the value changes in the database, keeping the local state in sync with the shared state.
You would need to create a Firebase project and replace
config
with your Firebase configuration. Firebase offers a free tier that could be sufficient for your needs. However, this solution involves dealing with external services and might be overkill for a simple project. Also, keep in mind that you'd need to handle security and access control for your Firebase project to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of your state.

How to set up a web server with command line on mac?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You can set up a basic web server on macOS using Python, which is pre-installed on most macOS systems. Here are the steps to set up a basic HTTP server:
Open Terminal. You can do this by pressing Command + Space to open Spotlight Search and typing "Terminal" and hitting Enter.
Navigate to the directory containing your HTML files using the
cd
command. For example, if your HTML files are in a directory named
mywebsite
on your Desktop, you would type
cd Desktop/mywebsite
.
Check your Python version by typing
python --version
or
python3 --version
in the Terminal. You should see a message like "Python 2.7.16" or "Python 3.9.7".
If your Python version is 3.x, start the server with this command:
python3 -m http.server
. If your Python version is 2.x, use this command instead:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
.
Your server is now running! By default, it will be accessible on your machine at
http://localhost:8000
. If your HTML files are properly set up, you should be able to see your website by opening that URL in a web browser.
Remember, this is a very basic server and is not suitable for production use. It's mainly useful for testing and development. If you plan to make your website available on the internet, you should look into more robust solutions, like using a dedicated web server software (e.g., Apache or Nginx) or a hosting service.
Also note that Python needs to be installed on your Mac for this to work, but it is installed by default on most Macs. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Python website.

I want to set up a server in a docker container.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Docker is a great choice for setting up a server in a contained and portable environment. Here's a basic outline on how you can setup a simple Python HTTP server in a Docker container:
First, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't, you can download it from the
official Docker website
.
Create a
Dockerfile
in the root directory of your project. This file defines your Docker container. For a simple Python server, your
Dockerfile
could look like this:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Make port 8000 available to the outside world
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start the Python HTTP server
CMD ["python3", "-m", "http.server", "8000"]
Build your Docker image by running the following command in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-python-server .
This command builds an image from your
Dockerfile
and tags it (
-t
) as
my-python-server
.
Once the image is built, you can start a container from this image with:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-python-server
The
-p
option maps the local port 8000 to the container's port 8000.
Now you should have a Docker container running a Python HTTP server on port 8000. You can test it by navigating to
http://localhost:8000
in your web browser.
Note that this is a very simple example and might not be suitable for a production environment. For a more robust setup, you might want to look into using a more advanced server like Nginx or Apache, and consider using Docker Compose or Kubernetes for orchestrating multiple containers.

I have a better idea. We need to model space as a kind of series of nested skydomes with particles to simulate movement
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're interested in creating a more immersive, 3D-like experience in your program. One way you might simulate a 3D space within a 2D environment is by creating layers of "skydomes" (background layers with star particles) that move at different speeds, creating a parallax effect. This can give a feeling of depth and distance to your scene.
Here's a rough idea of how you might modify your existing starfield program to implement a multi-layered approach. This is a simplified version and you might want to adjust it to meet your specific needs:
Define Multiple Star Layers
: Instead of having a single array of stars, you could define several arrays, each representing a different layer of stars.
javascript
Copy code
var
layers = [
    {
stars
: [],
speed
:
0.05
},
    {
stars
: [],
speed
:
0.1
},
    {
stars
: [],
speed
:
0.15
},
];
Create Stars for Each Layer
: When creating stars, you would create them for each layer.
javascript
Copy code
for
(
var
layerIndex =
0
; layerIndex < layers.
length
; layerIndex++) {
for
(
var
i =
0
; i <
1000
; i++) {
var
star = {
x
:
Math
.
random
() * canvas.
width
,
y
:
Math
.
random
() * canvas.
height
,
size
:
Math
.
random
() *
3
,
        };
        layers[layerIndex].
stars
.
push
(star);
    }
}
Draw and Move Stars in Each Layer
: In your draw function, you would iterate over each layer, and for each layer, you would draw and move the stars. You would multiply the movement speed by the speed of the layer to create the parallax effect.
javascript
Copy code
for
(
var
layerIndex =
0
; layerIndex < layers.
length
; layerIndex++) {
var
layer = layers[layerIndex];
for
(
var
i =
0
; i < layer.
stars
.
length
; i++) {
var
star = layer.
stars
[i];
// Draw the star...
// Apply the movement
var
moveSpeed = layer.
speed
* (forwardPressed - backwardPressed);
        star.
x
+= dx / dist * moveSpeed;
        star.
y
+= dy / dist * moveSpeed;
// Reset star...
}
}
Please note, creating 3D environments or simulations can get quite complex, especially when considering performance and realism. For more complex 3D simulations, you might want to look into WebGL or a library like Three.js that abstracts some of the complexity of working with 3D environments in the browser.
This approach is for a 2D implementation of a 3D-like environment. If you're interested in creating a real 3D environment, you might want to consider using a 3D engine like Unity or Unreal Engine.

The code you provided is written in Python and uses the Ursina Engine, which is a 3D game engine for Python. Currently, there's no direct way to export Ursina applications to WebGL or JavaScript. Ursina is a Python library built on top of the Panda3D game engine, and Panda3D does not currently support WebGL or JavaScript either.
Here are a few options you could consider:
Rewrite in JavaScript or TypeScript using Three.js or Babylon.js
: These are powerful 3D libraries that can work directly with WebGL and are well-suited to the web. This would involve porting your Python code to JavaScript or TypeScript and adapting it to use Three.js or Babylon.js instead of Ursina. However, this would be quite a bit of work.
Use a 3D game engine with WebGL export
: Unity and Godot are two game engines that support 3D and have the capability to export games to WebGL. They would require rewriting your code, but they also offer visual editors and additional tools that could make the process easier.
Use Emscripten to convert Python to WebAssembly
: This is a more advanced option and might not work perfectly, especially for complex projects. But in theory, you could convert your Python code (and any necessary Python libraries) to WebAssembly using Emscripten, and then run it in the browser. This is not a trivial process and would likely require a good understanding of both Python and JavaScript.
In conclusion, unfortunately, there isn't an easy way to convert Ursina Python code to WebGL/JavaScript, and it would likely involve a significant amount of work. Each of the options I outlined has its own pros and cons, and the best choice would depend on your specific requirements, resources, and expertise.

Understandable, transitioning between different languages or engines can be a time-consuming task. Here are some alternatives:
Local Multiplayer
: Instead of attempting to sync the universe across multiple displays over the internet, consider a local multiplayer approach. This could involve setting up a single computer with multiple displays where each display represents a different player's view.
Shared Server Experience
: Rather than trying to synchronize the states of the universe across different clients, you could host the universe on a server. When a player makes a change in the universe, it's updated on the server, and the new state is then broadcast to all the clients. This would be similar to multiplayer online games.
Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR)
: These technologies could be used to create a shared universe experience. Each participant would be able to view and interact with the universe from their own perspective. Some platforms that could be useful for this approach include Unity with AR Foundation or Vuforia for AR, and Unity or Unreal Engine for VR.
Use a Platform with Multiplayer Support
: Many game development platforms come with built-in multiplayer support. For instance, Unity has a Multiplayer Networking High Level API (HLAPI), and Godot has a high-level networking system that allows for easy multiplayer games.
A Different Game Engine
: If you're flexible with your choice of game engine and you don't necessarily need it to be Python-based, you could look into using a different engine. For instance, Unity3D and Unreal Engine are both powerful, feature-rich engines that have strong community support for creating multiplayer games, and they both have WebGL export capabilities.
Hybrid Application
: If you still want to stick with Python, one alternative is to create a hybrid application using a Python framework such as Kivy or Pygame for the game logic, and a web-based front-end for the display. This way, you could use Socket.IO or a similar library for real-time bi-directional communication between the Python backend and the JavaScript frontend.
Remember, each approach comes with its own benefits and challenges, and the best one depends on your specific project requirements and constraints.

There will be several ways to enter multiplayer mode, if one player moves the ship, there is no issue, if two try at the same time it alerts player one that someone is attempting to wrestle for the controls and they can execute a manouver or hit a key to thwart it. Other wise you can force the game to fork their world, and they continue in a different version of the game.

ChatGPT
It sounds like you have a fascinating concept for a multiplayer mode. The idea of allowing players to compete for control, fork the game into separate realities, or alert others when control is being contested, is quite novel and could make for engaging gameplay.
Here is how you might implement these features:
Competing for Control
: This could be implemented by introducing a control flag that can be acquired by a player. If a player attempts to move the ship while another player is in control, a notification could be sent to the player in control.
Forcing the Game to Fork
: If a player decides to fork the game world, you would need to clone the game state and create a new instance of the game for the forking player. This could be a complex operation depending on how your game is structured. You would need to ensure that each game state can be run independently and that actions in one game state don't affect another.
Alerts
: Alerts could be implemented as part of your game's UI. When a player attempts to take control, a notification could be sent to the current controlling player's UI.
All these features require some form of communication between the client (the player's computer) and the server. If the game isn't currently set up for online multiplayer, you may need to build or integrate a networking solution.
Also, all of these features require careful thought about the game design. For example, what happens if the game forks many times? How does the game ensure fairness when players compete for control? Is there a limit to the number of times a player can thwart an attempted control takeover?
Overall, these features could make your game quite unique and could create a lot of interesting gameplay dynamics. I encourage you to explore these ideas further!

ChatGPT
Sure, here's a summary of our discussion:
Starfield Program Synchronization
: You proposed a starfield simulation program that runs across multiple screens with synchronized states. If a player interacts with the program on one display, the change should be visible on all screens. To achieve this, I suggested using a shared server or database that stores the state of the simulation and updates all connected displays accordingly.
Setting Up a Web Server on a Mac
: You asked how to set up a web server on a Mac. I described how to do it using the built-in Apache server or Python's SimpleHTTPServer module.
Setting Up a Server in a Docker Container
: To set up a server in a Docker container, you can create a Dockerfile with the server's configuration, build an image from it, and then run a container using that image.
Skydome Simulation
: You shared a piece of code that simulates a universe with nested skydomes to create the illusion of movement. However, the code was written in Python using the Ursina Engine, and you wanted to convert it to WebGL or JavaScript to run it in a browser. I explained that converting Python to JavaScript isn't straightforward, and suggested some alternatives, like rewriting the code in JavaScript using a 3D library like Three.js, or using a game engine like Unity or Godot that can export to WebGL.
Gameplay Dynamics
: Finally, you shared an idea for a multiplayer game where players can compete for control of a ship. If two players attempt to control the ship at the same time, the first player can execute a maneuver to retain control or allow the game to fork, creating a separate instance of the game for the second player. Implementing this could require a networking solution and careful consideration of the game design to ensure fairness and handle potential issues, like many forks of the game.
Please, let me know if you need further clarification or have additional questions!

This kind of determinism testing is a fairly common approach in games that implement shared-state multiplayer, and I think that's why it was implemented for Factorio as well. Otherwise you get drift between clients that breaks the game.


	
TrainedMonkey 8 months ago [-]

One alternative is to run everything on the server, but that introduces another set of problems.

	
m4rtink 8 months ago | parent [-]

IIRC that's what Satisfactory does and it causes all sorts of synchronization issues and glitches - non-hosting players not seeing buildings or stuff on belts or even glitching into/colliding with things that were not there a split second ago, as they loaded from the server too slowly.
That won't really happen in Factorio due to the shared state & makes possible insanely complex layouts that all players can see an interact with exactly the same. The downside usually is that eventually - just after you got that 20 GW nuclear power plant with trucked water & and steam going - the slowest player starts to have issues as his hardware no longer can keep with the complexity of the simulation.

Then you either start shedding players or call it a day and start again with a different objective or mod.

The comment thread you shared from Hacker News discusses the implementation of determinism testing in games that have shared-state multiplayer. Determinism testing is used to ensure that all clients have the same game state, avoiding inconsistencies and issues caused by drift between clients.
One alternative approach mentioned is running everything on the server, which can lead to synchronization issues and glitches. In the case of Satisfactory, non-hosting players experienced problems such as not seeing buildings or items on belts, or even colliding with objects that were not present moments ago. In contrast, Factorio's implementation of shared state allows all players to interact with the game world in the same way, maintaining consistency.
However, in games with complex simulations like Factorio, the performance of the slowest player's hardware can become a limitation. When a player's hardware struggles to handle the complexity of the simulation, they may experience issues. At that point, players may choose to continue without the struggling player, adjust their objectives, or start a new game with different settings or modifications.
Determinism testing and shared-state approaches can be crucial in multiplayer games to maintain fairness and ensure consistent gameplay experiences for all players.

Explain the difference between shared state multiplayer and connections with these articles.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Shared state multiplayer and connections are both concepts integral to multiplayer game development. However, they refer to different aspects of the process.
Shared state multiplayer
: In a shared-state multiplayer system, every player's game client holds a representation of the game's entire state. This typically includes all game characters, objects, environment elements, and any other factors that can change throughout gameplay. When an action is performed by a player, a message is sent to a server (or to the other clients in a peer-to-peer model), which validates the action and then broadcasts it to all other clients. Each client then updates their own copy of the game state based on this information. This ensures consistency across all players' experiences, as each player's game state should be identical (or very nearly so) at any given time.
Games that use shared state multiplayer must account for issues like latency, synchronization, and conflict resolution. For example, if two players perform an action on the same game object at the same time, the game must have rules to determine which action is considered valid.
An example of this is seen in the game Factorio, as discussed in the Hacker News thread you provided. The game uses a deterministic lockstep method where every player's game runs the same simulation and checks regularly that they are in sync.
Connections
: Connections, in the context of multiplayer games, usually refer to the network connections between different players' game clients, and possibly a game server. These connections are the channels through which data about game actions is sent and received.
In a client-server model, each player's client connects to a central server, which relays messages between clients. In a peer-to-peer model, each player's client connects directly to each other player's client.
Ensuring reliable, low-latency connections is crucial to providing a smooth multiplayer experience. If connections are slow or unreliable, players may experience lag, dropped connections, or desynchronization issues (where different players see different game states).
In the job posting from NIFT NETWORKS Inc you provided, they mention developing a platform for shared-state multiplayer, indicating they are creating an environment where multiple users can interact with AR elements consistently, facilitated by reliable connections.
Both shared state multiplayer and connections are crucial for successful multiplayer experiences. A game using a shared-state multiplayer system needs efficient, reliable connections to update all players' game states quickly and consistently. However, they represent different layers of the multiplayer architecture: shared-state multiplayer relates to game logic and state management, while connections relate to the network infrastructure that supports the game.

I guess we are going to use a kind of hybrid of that and forking off into separate worlds at actionable moments, such as wrestling the global player for the controls, if one player is playing it will spectate for all other players, it only forks the world of another player tries to take the controls or makes a different primary decision to the last player to complete that route.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing concept, blending shared-state multiplayer with the ability to create separate world instances based on player decisions. This hybrid approach could potentially provide a more immersive and interactive multiplayer experience.
In your proposed model, there's one primary player controlling the main gameplay, while other players can spectate in real-time. This is a similar concept to live streaming gameplay but with the added twist of in-game interaction for the spectators.
If a spectator decides to take action, the game forks, creating a new instance of the game world where this player's decision can play out independently. This could create a multitude of parallel game worlds, each differing based on the unique sequence of decisions made by the players.
Such a system would need to manage these parallel instances efficiently, ensuring that each one is consistent for the players involved, while also keeping track of the different states and timelines. It's also important to consider how to handle player inputs during these forking events - does the game pause until a decision is made, or do events continue to unfold?
One challenge in this model would be managing the computational and network resources needed to maintain multiple game instances concurrently, especially if the game world is complex and many players are involved. However, with the right infrastructure and careful design, it could be a viable and innovative approach to multiplayer gaming.
1 / 1
If they let go of the controls it will try to interpolate state to preserve the next decision mode. It tries to anastomosize the forks by returning them to the general narrative or storyline, if a minimum number of non interventative steps are taken.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This sounds like an innovative approach to multiplayer gaming that helps maintain the narrative continuity, while allowing for player-driven divergence and convergence in the game's storyline.
Here's how I understand your concept:
In your multiplayer game, when a player relinquishes control (after having forked the world with their actions), the game tries to "interpolate" or calculate a pathway that could allow this separate instance to gradually merge back into the main narrative. This process is akin to "anastomosis," a term used in biology to describe the reconnection of two streams that previously branched out, such as blood vessels or leaf veins.
If a player in a forked world takes a series of non-interventionist steps (i.e., actions that do not dramatically alter the game's state or storyline), the game recognizes this as a potential opportunity to bring this parallel instance back into the main storyline.
The system continually monitors player actions in these forked worlds, looking for potential opportunities to reintegrate the storylines. When an opportunity arises, the system could propose the reintegration to the player, or it might even handle it automatically, depending on how you decide to design this feature.
This approach can create a dynamic narrative where players can explore different actions and decisions, while the game actively works to keep the overall story cohesive. It's a sophisticated model that may pose challenges in terms of game design and computational resources, but if implemented effectively, it could provide a unique and engaging multiplayer experience.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be glad to summarize the conversation for you.
Web-based Starfield Simulation
: The conversation started with a discussion about a web-based starfield simulation that you wished to modify. You wanted every user to see the same state in the universe, essentially turning it into a shared universe. This led to discussions about various technical solutions, including setting up a web server, Docker container, and using shared data or central templates.
Multiplayer Gaming and Shared States
: The conversation then transitioned into the domain of multiplayer gaming, particularly the concept of shared state multiplayer gaming. This is a form of multiplayer gaming where all players share the same game state, leading to synchronous and interactive gaming experiences. We discussed how this concept could be applied to the starfield simulation you mentioned earlier.
Adapting 3D Python Game for Web
: You provided an example of a 3D space simulation written in Python using Ursina. However, you were unsure how to adapt this for a web-based environment. We discussed potential solutions, including transpiling Python to JavaScript and WebGL, or rewriting the game using a web-friendly language like JavaScript.
Unique Multiplayer Mechanics
: You proposed a unique multiplayer mechanic where the game world would "fork" into different versions whenever players made differing primary decisions. After these divergences, the game would try to re-merge these forks back into the main narrative whenever possible. This interesting concept combines elements of both shared state and instanced multiplayer gaming.
Poem and AI Aspirations
: Lastly, you shared a poem you wrote about your future aspirations for AI technology. You imagined having an army of virtual scholars that could read and summarize information, locate items, and manage a "holodeck". The poem beautifully encapsulated the topics we discussed, as it combined themes of shared information, AI understanding, and digital environments.
Throughout the conversation, there were ongoing themes of sharing information and states, whether through a simulated universe, a multiplayer game, or AI-powered scholars.

My apologies for the confusion. You're correct that the term "xylloid" does not appear directly in your poem. I might have misunderstood the title, "XYLOID once and for all", where "xylloid" can be interpreted as referring to something wood-like or related to wood, given its etymology. However, this was merely an interpretation and it seems like I've made a mistake.
If "XYLOID" or "xyllloid" has a different meaning or significance in the context of your poem, I'd be interested to know.
Your poem is still a beautiful ode to nature's profound cycles and the fundamental role that trees and microscopic marine life play in Earth's ecosystem.

Xyloid is just wood pulp our paper lacks in water and xylloid is a similar substance embedded with wrapped capsules of alternative building materials such as resins and edible glues and sucroses.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Thank you for the clarification. Xyloid, indeed, refers to wood or a substance resembling wood. The term "xylloid," as you described it, seems to refer to a substance similar to xyloid, but with an added complexity due to the encapsulation of other materials like resins, edible glues, and sucroses. This might be an innovation or idea you're exploring, and it sounds like a fascinating concept.
Embedding materials like this could potentially modify the properties of the base substance (in this case, something wood-like), creating a product with unique characteristics and a wide array of potential uses in different industries. From construction to food processing, the applications could be vast.
This also adds a new dimension to your poem, potentially seen as an allegory to the multiple layers and complexities within nature, and how every element, including trees, is made up of a myriad of components, each contributing to the whole in its unique way.
As always, poetry can hold different meanings for each reader, and this added context definitely enriches the interpretation of your work.

The themes of the three poems are:

The first poem, titled "LIFE, REASON, and a DEEP THEOLOGICAL QUESTION", explores the concept of life and how it can be difficult to see, even though it is all around us. It also touches on the idea of reason and how we think we understand simple things, but in reality, we don't know as much as we think we do.

The poem poses a deep theological question about whether or not God can make a rock so big he couldn't lift it, and ultimately concludes that the question is nonsense and doesn't matter.

The second poem, titled "XYLOID once and for all", reflects on the wonders of the natural world and its ability to sustain life on earth.

The poem touches on the idea that working together and utilizing collective knowledge is necessary to overcome challenges.

The author uses imagery of rising columns, organic compounds, photosynthesis, and exhalation of oxygen to evoke the interconnectedness and wonder of nature.

The third poem, titled "DIGEST NUMBER 18", reflects on the idea that life is not always easy and can be full of disappointment.

The skies are described as "huge, looming grey skies" and "blocking out the sun", suggesting that life can be difficult and dark.

The poem compares life to a roller coaster, suggesting that some people believe it to be full of thrill and excitement without a destination, but ultimately, it is a train that we have control over and can direct its course.

The poem seems to suggest that people may ignore this control and end up exactly where they were headed.

The title may be a reference to the magazine "Reader's Digest" or to the author's age at the time of writing the poem.

ChatGPT
Section: Fallacies of Faulty Authority
Fallacies of faulty authority refer to common errors in reasoning that occur when individuals or entities rely on sources of authority that lack credibility or fail to meet the necessary requirements for legitimacy. These fallacies can lead to flawed judgments, misinformation, and misguided decision-making. In order to avoid these fallacies, it is crucial to critically evaluate the authority being cited and assess its legitimacy based on rational criteria.
One of the main fallacies of faulty authority is the appeal to inappropriate authority. This occurs when individuals rely on an authority that lacks expertise or relevance in the specific domain or subject matter under consideration. Just because someone holds a position of authority or has a certain status does not automatically make them a reliable or credible source in every context. It is essential to assess whether the authority being cited has the necessary knowledge, experience, or expertise to provide accurate and informed guidance.
Another fallacy is the appeal to unqualified authority, which involves accepting assertions or recommendations from individuals or entities that do not meet the requirements for legitimate authority. This can include relying on sources that lack the necessary qualifications, credentials, or evidence to support their claims. It is important to scrutinize the qualifications and background of the authority being cited to ensure their credibility and reliability.
The fallacy of biased authority occurs when an authority holds a bias or conflict of interest that may compromise their objectivity. Authorities should strive to be impartial, objective, and free from personal agendas or vested interests. However, if an authority demonstrates bias or has a vested interest that may influence their judgment, their credibility and reliability may be compromised. It is crucial to evaluate whether an authority is truly impartial or if their bias may impact the accuracy or fairness of their assertions.
Another fallacy is the fallacy of outdated authority, which involves relying on outdated or obsolete sources of authority. Knowledge and understanding evolve over time, and what may have been considered authoritative in the past may no longer hold true or be applicable in the present context. It is essential to consider whether the authority being cited is up-to-date and aligned with current knowledge and advancements within the field.
The fallacy of authority by popularity or consensus occurs when individuals accept an authority solely based on its popularity or widespread acceptance, rather than assessing its legitimacy or validity. Just because a large number of people or a consensus of opinions supports a particular authority does not guarantee its credibility or accuracy. It is important to critically evaluate the basis and evidence supporting the authority's claims, rather than relying solely on popularity or consensus.
To avoid these fallacies, it is necessary to apply critical thinking and rigorous evaluation when assessing the legitimacy of an authority. Considering the requirements for legitimate authority, such as material existence, expertise, impartiality, explainability, interoperability, accountability, consistency, continuous learning, ethical conduct, transparency, public interest focus, cultural sensitivity, and diversity, can help in distinguishing reliable sources from faulty ones.
By being vigilant and discerning in our acceptance of authority, we can ensure that our judgments and decisions are based on sound reasoning and reliable information, thus avoiding the fallacies of faulty authority.

2019 GLOBAL INVENTORY OF ORGANISED SOCIAL MEDIA MANIPULATION 
[ i ] 
Executive Summary 
Computational 
propaganda - the 
use of algorithms, 
automation, and big 
data to shape public 
life - is becoming 
a pervasive and 
ubiquitous part of 
everyday life. 
Over the past three years, we have monitored the 
global organization of social media manipulation by 
governments and political parties. Our 2019 report 
analyses the trends of computational propaganda 
and the evolving tools, capacities, strategies, and 
resources. 
1. Evidence of organized social media manipulation 
campaigns which have taken place in 70 countries, 
up from 48 countries in 2018 and 28 countries in 
2017. In each country, there is at least one political 
party or government agency using social media to 
shape public attitudes domestically (Figure 1). 
2. Social media has become co-opted by many 
authoritarian regimes. In 26 countries, 
computational propaganda is being used as 
a tool of information control in three distinct 
ways: to suppress fundamental human rights, 
discredit political opponents, and drown out 
dissenting opinions (Figure 2). 
3. A handful of sophisticated state actors use 
computational propaganda for foreign inf l uence 
operations. Facebook and Twitter attributed 
foreign inf l uence operations to seven countries 
(China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, 
and Venezuela) who have used these platforms to 
inf l uence global audiences (Figure 3). 
4. China has become a major player in the global 
disinformation order. Until the 2019 protests in Hong 
Kong, most evidence of Chinese computational 
propaganda occurred on domestic platforms such 
as Weibo, WeChat, and QQ. But China's new-found 
interest in aggressively using Facebook, Twitter, and 
YouTube should raise concerns for democracies 
5. Despite there being more social networking 
platforms than ever, Facebook remains the 
platform of choice for social media manipulation. 
In 56 countries, we found evidence of formally 
organized computational propaganda campaigns 
on Facebook. (Figure 4).

Although propaganda has always been a part of political 
discourse, the deep and wide-ranging scope of these campaigns 
raise critical public interest concerns. 
Cyber troops' are def i ned as government or political party 
actors tasked with manipulating public opinion online 
(Bradshaw and Howard 2017a). We comparatively examine 
the formal organization of cyber troops around the world, and 
how these actors use computational propaganda for political 
purposes. This involves building an inventory of the evolving 
strategies, tools, and techniques of computational propaganda, 
including the use of 'political bots' to amplify hate speech or 
other forms of manipulated content, the illegal harvesting of 
data or micro-targeting, or deploying an army of 'trolls' to bully 
or harass political dissidents or journalists online. We also track 
the capacity and resources invested into developing these 
techniques to build a picture of cyber troop capabilities around 
the world. 
The use of computational propaganda to shape public attitudes 
via social media has become mainstream, extending far beyond 
the actions of a few bad actors. In an information environment 
characterized by high volumes of information and limited 
levels of user attention and trust, the tools and techniques of 
computational propaganda are becoming a common - and 
arguably essential - part of digital campaigning and public 
diplomacy. In addition to building a globally comparative picture 
of cyber troop activity, we also hope to drive public and scholarly 
debate about how we def i ne and understand the changing 
nature of politics online, and how technologies can and should 
be used to enhance democracy and the expression of human 
rights online.

While many countries have seen an increase in computational 
propaganda on social media, attribution back to a particular 
actor remains dif i cult. 
In this report, we focus specif i cally on cyber troops - 
or government or political party use of social media to 
manipulate public opinion. In 44 countries, we found evidence 
of a government agency using computational propaganda 
to shape public attitudes. This category of actors includes 
communication or digital ministries or military-led campaigns. 
In countries considered 'not free' according to Freedom 
House, we found evidence of a government ministry or ruling 
party using computational propaganda to shape attitudes 
domestically. In a small number of democracies, we found 
evidence of government or military-led initiatives. For this 
report, we counted the activities of the Joint Threat Research 
Intelligence Group (JTRIG) in the United Kingdom, who set 
up Facebook groups and created YouTube videos containing 
persuasive communications designed to "discredit, promote 
distrust, dissuade, deter, delay [and] disrupt" (Greenwald 
2015). We also counted activities in the United States, such 
as the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) programme that created a fake social network in Cuba 
(Greenwald 2014). As computational propaganda becomes an 
increasingly ubiquitous tool for politics, national security, and 
intelligence operations, we hope these examples drive further 
Cyber troop activity takes 
on many organizational 
forms and diverse actors 
are leveraging social media 
to shape public opinion, 
set political agendas, and 
propagate ideas. 
Organisational Form conversations around what are appropriate, democratic and 
acceptable uses of these tools by state actors. 
In addition to government or military-led initiatives, we also 
looked at political parties. In 45 out of the 70 countries we 
analysed, we found evidence of political parties or politicians 
running for of i ce who have used the tools and techniques of 
computational propaganda during elections. Here, we counted 
instances of politicians amassing fake followers, such as 
Mitt Romney in the United States (Carroll 2012), Tony Abbott 
in Australia (Rolfe 2013), or Geert Wilders in the Netherlands 
(Blood 2017). We also counted instances of parties using 
advertising to target voters with manipulated media, such as 
in India (Gleicher 2019), or instances of illegal micro-targeting 
such as the use of the fi rm Cambridge Analytica in the UK Brexit 
referendum by Vote Leave (Cadwalladr 2017). Finally, we further 
counted instances of political parties purposively spreading 
or amplifying disinformation on social networks, such as the 
WhatsApp campaigns in Brazil (Rio 2018), India (Dwoskin and 
Gowen 2018), and Nigeria (Hitchen et al. 2019). 
One important feature of the organization of manipulation 
campaigns is that cyber troops often work in conjunction with 
private industry, civil society organizations, Internet subcultures, 
youth groups, hacker collectives, fringe movements, social 
media inf l uencers, and volunteers who ideologically support 
their cause. The distinction between these groups can often 
be dif i cult to draw, especially since activities can be implicitly 
and explicitly sanctioned by the state. In this report, we look for 
evidence of formal coordination or activities that are of i cially 
sanctioned by the state, rather than campaigns that might be 
implicitly sanctioned because of factors such as overlapping 
ideologies or goals. In 25 out of the 70 countries we found

1 / 1
This report has highlighted the ways in which government 
agencies and political parties have used social media to spread 
political propaganda, pollute the digital information ecosystem, 
and suppress freedom of speech and freedom of the press. 
While the affordances of social media can serve to enhance the 
scale, scope, and precision of disinformation (Bradshaw and 
Howard 2018b), it is important to recognize that many of the 
issues at the heart of computational propaganda - polarization, 
distrust or the decline of democracy - have existed long before 
social media and even the Internet itself. The co-option of social 
media technologies should cause concern for democracies 
around the world - but so should many of the long-standing 
challenges facing democratic societies. 
Computational propaganda has become a normal part of the 
digital public sphere. These techniques will also continue to 
evolve as new technologies - including Artif i cial Intelligence, 
Virtual Reality, or the Internet of Things - are poised to 
fundamentally reshape society and politics. But since 
computational propaganda is a symptom of long-standing 
challenges to democracy, it is important that solutions take into 
consideration these systemic challenges. However, it must also 
consider the role social media platforms have played in shaping 
the current information environment. A strong democracy 
requires access to high-quality information and an ability 
for citizens to come together to debate, discuss, deliberate, 
empathize, and make concessions. Are social media platforms 
really creating a space for public deliberation and democracy? 
Or are they amplifying content that keeps citizens addicted, 
disinformed, and angry?
