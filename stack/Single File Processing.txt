Here's a simplified version of your script that processes
only one file passed as a parameter
and no longer tracks progress or logs processing history:

Changes made:
Removed the progress-tracking and logging to
progress.log
.
Simplified to process only one file, explicitly provided as a command-line argument.
Maintained chunk-based summarization functionality.
Retained creation and cleanup of temporary directories for safe file handling.

bash
Copiar c��digo
./script.sh path/to/file.txt

$ git commit -m "Summarize"
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
ChatGPT dijo:
This message means your local branch and the remote branch (
origin/main
) have diverged. Each has a unique commit that the other does not.
To resolve this, you should either
merge
or
rebase
:
1. Using merge (creates a merge commit):
bash
Copiar c��digo
git pull origin main
2. Using rebase (linear history, cleaner if you prefer):
bash
Copiar c��digo
git pull --rebase origin main
After resolving potential conflicts (if any), push your changes back:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git push origin main
Why did this happen?
Your local and remote branches have commits that aren't shared, possibly due to edits on GitHub directly or another local clone.
Recommended solution:
Use
git pull --rebase origin main
for a cleaner, linear commit history.

Explanation of the Problem:
The reason Git says
"nothing to commit, working tree clean"
is that there are no staged changes compared to the current
HEAD
. Your previous commit (the one you see labeled as
detached HEAD 137cb1d
) was already included through the rebase.
Currently, your local branch (
main
) and remote (
origin/main
) have diverged (one unique commit each). Even though you edited
Ecological-Superstructures-overview.txt
, it seems the changes may have been saved incorrectly or weren't staged as intended.
Steps to Resolve:
Step 1: Verify File Changes
Check what has changed since your last commit:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git status
If
git status
says nothing to commit, it means you have no changes made since the last commit.
If your recent edits aren't showing up, you might not have saved the file or saved it incorrectly.
If you see your changes, stage them explicitly:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git add Ecological-Superstructures-overview.txt
Step 2: Resolve Divergence by Pulling Remote Changes
You previously rebased locally, but it appears there's still divergence. Try pulling again explicitly:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git pull --rebase origin main
If there are conflicts, resolve them manually.
Step 3: After Resolving Conflicts (if any), Push
bash
Copiar c��digo
git push origin main
Explanation of Your Current State:
You rebased your local changes onto the remote.
Your new commit (
137cb1d
) was successfully created by rebasing.
Git detached temporarily during the rebase, but automatically returned you to
main
.
Your subsequent
git add .
and
git commit
found no new changes to commit.
Recommended Next Steps:
Run:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git status
Then verify:
If there
are untracked or unstaged files
, stage explicitly and commit again:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git add <file>
git commit -m
"Your message"
If there's
nothing left to commit
, simply push:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git push origin main
If pushing still indicates divergence, explicitly pull first to reconcile:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
Conclusion:
You can't add a new commit now because Git sees no new changes since your rebase already integrated your earlier edits. If you genuinely made new edits, stage and commit again. If not, proceed with
git pull --rebase origin main
, followed by a push.

I would like to make this gif like twice as big and add in italics under it "The Last Good Movie" # Take with a grain of salt

![The Last Good Movie](The-Last-Good-Movie.gif)

# Ecological Superstructures
ChatGPT dijo:
Here's how you can accomplish this using ImageMagick (assuming it's installed):
Step 1:
Resize the GIF to double its size
bash
Copiar c��digo
convert The-Last-Good-Movie.gif -coalesce -resize 200% resized.gif
Step 2:
Add italic text below the GIF
Create the final GIF with italicized text beneath:
bash
Copiar c��digo
convert resized.gif \
  -gravity south -background none -splice 0x50 \
  -annotate +0+10
'The Last Good Movie'
\
  -font DejaVu-Serif-Italic -pointsize 30 \
  final.gif
Explanation of commands:
-resize 200%
doubles the GIF size.
-gravity south
positions text at the bottom.
-splice 0x50
adds extra vertical space for the text.
-font DejaVu-Serif-Italic
specifies an italic font.
Adjust
-pointsize 30
if you want bigger or smaller text.
Final GIF:
The output GIF will be named
final.gif
.
Dijiste:
can't I just use an html tag in github markdown the gif is large neough it is just displaying small
ChatGPT dijo:
Yes, you can absolutely use HTML within GitHub Markdown to easily adjust the GIF size and add italicized text beneath it.
Here's how you can do it directly in your Markdown file:
html
Copiar c��digo
<
p
align
=
"center"
>
<
img
src
=
"The-Last-Good-Movie.gif"
width
=
"600px"
alt
=
"The Last Good Movie"
>
<
br
>
<
em
>The Last Good Movie
</
em
>
</
p
>
Explanation:
width="600px"
adjusts the GIF size. Change the value to your desired size.
<em>
tags italicize the text.
The
align="center"
attribute centers the GIF and text nicely.
Result:
The GIF displays larger, exactly at your desired size.
The italicized text appears directly underneath.
This method is clean, quick, and works perfectly within GitHub Markdown!
