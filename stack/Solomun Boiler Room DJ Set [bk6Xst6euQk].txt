It stands ourselves in so long.
Hangover symphonies and sweaty Sundays.
DJs and more past races in the hallway.
Hey, this is your invitation.
We'd like to see you move.
And this is how we're gonna work it.
And this is how it goes in our house.

Just whisperings of pain
Just say goodbye to me
Can't you see my lost and lonely brain
Sadness, don't you see your pain
Think I'll jump too deep on this
Last goodbye for you, I'll leave a kiss
Say goodbye to me
Say goodbye to me
Say goodbye
Look at me
Just at the shell
Son of love, you have my heart in pain
Recess, love's left and gone away
It's like all the stars in the sky
They will die and burn out in flames
Say goodbye to me
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye to me
Say goodbye

I just saw him come already, from a fortunate place, things like glucose, something we all
adore.
One thing we're dying for, nothing but pain, stuck in this gap, searching for fortunate
things.
Nothing we all adore, one thing we die for, nothing but pain, stuck in this gap, searching
for fortunate things.
That's my head.
Nothing we all adore, nothing but pain, stuck in this gap, searching for fortunate
things.
Nothing we all adore, nothing but pain, stuck in this gap, searching for fortunate
things.
Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel right, I am home again.
It's so crazy that y'all have been saying this and you know this, watching drama of money
and addiction and all that, we all want to find a way out of life in front of a heartless
gang back there.
We're all human beings, we're all susceptible to our only temptation, we're very strong
with it.
And that's what this movie is about, Citation, Women, and Fortune, and that.
I did a song called, Already, called, Fortunate Things.
Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am young again.
Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am far again.
Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel right, I am home again.
