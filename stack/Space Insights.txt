I Hired Elon Musk to Be My Personal Space Guide: A Journey through Null Convention Logic and Markov Blankets
In the realm of computing and AI, there exist enigmatic concepts like null convention logic (NCL) and Markov blankets. It might seem as if these concepts are reserved for the academically initiated, but imagine hiring Elon Musk, the renowned visionary of space and tech, as your personal guide through these terrains. His guidance might help you appreciate how these concepts are akin to the wondrous interstellar journeys he has been pioneering.
First, let's embark on the journey of understanding null convention logic. NCL is a form of asynchronous logic that has the advantage of lower power consumption, fewer timing constraints, and higher tolerance to process variations than conventional synchronous logic. In NCL, computations are performed in waves, separated by null or empty information. These empty or null cycles are represented as propagating null wavefronts.
Imagine a spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars, and then back again. The journey to Mars could be considered as a 'data' cycle, where meaningful work is being done. The return journey, on the other hand, could be likened to the 'null' cycle. During this period, no productive task is performed, but the system prepares for the next wave of data. This back-and-forth cycle reflects the NCL's operation, where the propagating null wavefront acts as a resetting mechanism between computation cycles.
Now, let's shift our gaze to Markov blankets. In the field of probability theory and statistics, a Markov blanket for a node in a graphical model contains all the variables that shield the node from the rest of the network. This means that the Markov blanket of a node is the only knowledge needed to predict the behavior of that node and its children.
This could be likened to our spacecraft, surrounded by a protective heat shield as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. This heat shield, or Markov blanket, provides all the necessary protection (or in our statistical model, information) needed for the spacecraft to safely navigate re-entry. Anything outside of this shield is rendered irrelevant, just as in our statistical model, where only the information within the Markov blanket is necessary for prediction.
Thus, guided by Elon Musk, we can see these complex concepts in a new light. The propagating null wavefront in NCL becomes a necessary reset journey, preparing the system for the next cycle of computation. The Markov blanket transforms into a protective shield, containing all the necessary information for predicting a node's behavior. These seemingly abstract concepts, when translated into the language of interstellar travel, become tangible and easier to grasp, furthering our appreciation for the intricacies of both space exploration and computational intelligence.

Lamborghini vs 10,000 Balloons: Can It Float? Navigating Deleuzian Rhizomatic Superstructures with Graph Theory, Voronoi Diagrams, and Ising Models
A Lamborghini, a symbol of luxury, power, and speed, is grounded by the laws of physics, destined to traverse only terrestrial routes. But what if we tether it to 10,000 helium-filled balloons? Can it float? The question seems whimsical, but it serves as a gateway to an exploration of change, multiplicity, and systems dynamics according to Gilles Deleuze's philosophy, using graph theory, Voronoi diagrams, Ising models, and concepts from computational theory like polycomputation and multiple scale processing.
In Deleuzian thought, the rhizome is a metaphorical model for society, knowledge, and the world. It represents a non-hierarchical, non-linear structure where any point can connect to any other. This is where graph theory comes in. In graph theory, complex systems are represented as nodes (points) and edges (connections). The rhizome, like a graph, is characterized by its flexibility and potential for change. Each node, representing an entity in the system, is like a balloon. Each balloon, filled with helium, striving to rise, is only held in place by the connections it shares with the others - the edges of our graph.
Voronoi diagrams, mathematical constructs used to understand spatial organization and closest relationships, offer another layer of understanding. Imagine each balloon in our 10,000 as a node in the Voronoi diagram. The diagram divides the space into cells, each containing one balloon, with the property that every point in a cell is closer to its balloon than any other. This captures another aspect of the rhizome - the influence and interaction of each node with its immediate environment and how they collectively contribute to the larger structure.
The Ising model, a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics, can be seen as a metaphor for change and interaction within the rhizome. Each node, or balloon, is like a magnetic dipole with a spin that can be in one of two states - up (floating) or down (grounded). The collective behavior of these spins, influenced by their neighboring spins, determines the overall state - whether our Lamborghini floats or stays grounded.
Polycomputation and multiple scale processing, concepts from computational theory, speak to the inherent multiplicity and scale variance in Deleuze's rhizome. Polycomputation suggests the simultaneous processing of many computational elements, like the multiple balloons, each exerting its lifting force. Multiple scale processing hints at the various levels at which the rhizomatic structure can be analyzed - from the individual balloons (microscale) to the entire set of 10,000 (macroscale).
So, can the Lamborghini float? Deleuze might argue that it's not about the outcome, but the potential for change, the continuous process of becoming. It's not about whether the Lamborghini floats, but the multiplicity of interactions and transformations that occur within the system, the various scales at which they happen, and the potential for novel connections and unanticipated outcomes - the very essence of the rhizome.

I Bought an Entire Factory and Gave It to the Workers: Cyclofabianism, Zera Yacob, and the Motile Womb Theory
To navigate the currents of modern socio-economic philosophy and cognitive theory, we must first embark on a historical exploration, retracing the roots of Cyclofabianism back to the Fabian Society and Ethiopian philosopher Zera Yacob. We'll also unravel the fascinating threads of the Motile Womb Theory, examining its connections to theories of the mind and the Global Workspace Theory. Imagine this journey as if we've just bought an entire factory and handed it over to its workers - a revolutionary act that disrupts traditional power structures and reshapes the dynamics of production.
Cyclofabianism, a term forged from the ideas of cyclical economic structures and the Fabian Society's philosophy, signifies gradual and democratic societal transformation through the equitable distribution of resources. The Fabian Society, named after the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus, who was known for his 'delaying' tactics, advocated for gradual social change through reforms and innovative strategies. Their goal was not to overthrow capitalism abruptly but to transform it from within, seeking a socialist society without a violent revolution - akin to the act of buying a factory and giving it to the workers.
The ideas of Zera Yacob, a 17th-century Ethiopian philosopher, also imbue Cyclofabianism with a more profound philosophical depth. Yacob's philosophy, rooted in rationality, equality, and natural law ethics, emphasized the intrinsic worth of every human being. His vision of a society where everyone has a rightful share and voice resonates with the Cyclofabian notion of equitable distribution.
Now, let's turn to the Motile Womb Theory, a novel approach to understanding human cognition and decision-making. This theory draws upon ancient Greek beliefs of the wandering womb to explore the mind's dynamic nature. Just as the Greeks believed the womb was an independent entity within the body, moving and influencing a person's behavior and health, the Motile Womb Theory proposes that our cognitive processes are not confined to a specific mental 'location'.
The Global Workspace Theory further illuminates this concept. It suggests our consciousness works like a theater, with different mental processes competing for the spotlight on the stage of our awareness. Each process, like a wandering womb, moves within the mind, influencing our cognition and decision-making.
The act of purchasing a factory and giving it to the workers parallels these theoretical constructs. It's a practical manifestation of Cyclofabianism - the gradual redistribution of resources and power. Moreover, it mirrors the Motile Womb Theory and the Global Workspace Theory, as it disrupts the traditionally 'fixed' structures of economic power, enabling a more dynamic, equitable, and conscious system.
In this factory, every worker, like a wandering womb or a mental process in the global workspace, has the potential to influence the course of production and decision-making. They're not confined to a fixed role but are free to move, contribute, and reshape the system. This reflects the core principles of Cyclofabianism, the philosophy of Zera Yacob, and our understanding of human cognition - a harmonious confluence of socio-economic philosophy and cognitive theory.

Here are three key principles I've found useful in my own 
attempts to use GPT-4 in my work. 
Principle 1: Treat GPT-4 like an undergrad research assistant, 
not an omniscient oracle. 
If you've ever worked with an undergraduate research assistant 
(or if you were one in college), you know that a helper like that 
is both powerful and limited in specif i c ways. 
In some ways, GPT-4 far exceeds any human research assis- 
tant: it has access to an incredibly broad base of knowledge, 
it is blindingly fast, and it's available whenever you need it (as 
opposed to needing to study for midterms). 
It also has many of the other drawbacks of a human research 
assistant: it's not an expert, its grasp of any particular subject is 
fairly shallow, and it gets things wrong. In fact, when it's wrong, 
it's worse than a human research assistant, since a human will 
often have the good sense to warn you when he or she isn't 
certain about the quality of their output. 
Despite these drawbacks, the power of giving everyone access 
to nearly instantaneous, on-demand research help is truly 
remarkable. Just make sure you cross-check results with deeper 
sources and actual human experts.

Your insights into using GPT-4 are indeed valuable. Let me provide a summary of the three principles:
Principle 1: Treat GPT-4 like an undergraduate research assistant, not an omniscient oracle.
GPT-4, like any AI model, is a tool with its own strengths and limitations. It's essential to understand these characteristics to effectively use it in your work.
Strengths:
Broad Knowledge: GPT-4 has been trained on a diverse range of data, giving it a broad base of knowledge.
Speed: GPT-4 can process and generate responses faster than any human.
Availability: GPT-4 is available whenever you need it, without the constraints of human schedules or personal needs.
Limitations:
Lack of Expertise: While GPT-4 has broad knowledge, its understanding of any specific subject is relatively shallow.
Potential for Errors: GPT-4 can make mistakes and lacks the human capacity to realize when it's uncertain or wrong.
These characteristics make GPT-4 a powerful tool, comparable to an undergraduate research assistant. It can provide fast, accessible information across a wide range of topics. However, like with an undergraduate research assistant, it's crucial to verify the information GPT-4 provides with deeper sources and consult with human experts to ensure accuracy.
This is a great way to look at the use of AI like GPT-4. Keeping these principles in mind can help guide effective and responsible use of AI in various professional and personal contexts.

Principle 2: Think of yourself as a director, not a carpenter. 
When we work with tools, we are trained to think of them as 
an extension of us. A carpenter swings a hammer and gets one 
step closer to completing a house. He or she knows what the 
hammer will do each time it swings, and works accordingly. 
134 
Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI 
This metaphor breaks down when it comes to tools like GPT-4. 
Rather than manipulating a physical tool to generate a predict- 
able and planned result, using GPT-4 is like directing a scene 
from a movie. 
As the director, you're working with an actor to elicit the best 
performance. You're not telling them, "Bend your neck fi fteen 
degrees, and then after 2.5 seconds, look at the person across 
from you." Instead, you're asking them to make the audience 
feel a certain way: "Convince us you're in love." 
GPT-4 isn't a human actor, but the process of directing it is 
similar. You have to coax out your desired result, and you may 
need to try many variations on a prompt in the same way a 
director might need to fi lm multiple takes of the same scene. 
It's ultimately a collaborative process.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Principle 2: Think of yourself as a director, not a carpenter.
This principle emphasizes that using AI like GPT-4 involves a different kind of interaction compared to traditional tools.
Traditional tools, like a hammer, are predictable and completely controlled by the user. They can be used to achieve precise, planned outcomes. This is comparable to a carpenter swinging a hammer; the carpenter knows exactly what will happen with each swing.
However, using GPT-4 is more like directing a scene in a movie. As the director, you're not controlling every minute action of the actors, but rather guiding them to achieve the desired emotion or effect. The actors have their own understanding and interpretation of the scene, just as GPT-4 has its own "understanding" based on the data it was trained on.
When using GPT-4, the goal is to guide it to generate the desired output, rather than directly controlling its actions. This might involve trying different prompts or approaches, similar to how a director might film multiple takes of a scene to get the best performance.
This principle reflects the collaborative nature of working with AI. Understanding this can help to leverage the strengths of AI like GPT-4 and generate more effective and nuanced results.
1 / 1
Principle 3: Just try it! 
In most of our work, we're taught to plan in advance and avoid 
making mistakes. That's because implementing a plan is costly 
in terms of time and other resources—there's a reason a car- 
penter's adage is to measure twice and cut once. 
But what if implementing a plan was cheaper and faster than 
thinking about it? 
That's the confounding paradox of GPT-4 and LLMs. In far 
less time than it takes to debate a plan, GPT-4 can simply gen- 
erate a complete response for you to review. If you don't like 
the response, you can throw it away and generate another one, 
or you might just generate three variations to give you more 
potential choices.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Principle 3: Just try it!
This principle highlights one of the key advantages of AI like GPT-4: the ability to quickly and cheaply generate potential solutions or outputs.
In many traditional work contexts, careful planning and avoiding mistakes is paramount. This is because implementing plans often involves significant costs in terms of time, resources, and effort. Hence the carpenter's adage: measure twice, cut once.
However, with GPT-4 and other Large Language Models (LLMs), the cost of "implementation" — that is, generating a response or solution — is often much lower. GPT-4 can quickly generate a complete response, which can then be evaluated and either used, adjusted, or discarded based on its quality.
If the first response isn't satisfactory, GPT-4 can simply generate another one. This allows for a more iterative and experimental approach, where multiple options can be generated and the best one chosen. This ability to quickly try out different approaches and learn from them is a significant advantage of AI like GPT-4.
So, the principle here is to just try it out. Generate a response, evaluate it, and iterate as necessary. This can often be more efficient and productive than spending a lot of time on upfront planning.

Thou shalt verify your own work.
Always double-check your work for errors. This simple step can save time and resources in the long run.
Thou shalt check each other's work.
Just as you check your own work, also review the work of others. This provides another layer of quality control and can catch errors that the original person may have missed.
Thou shalt pay attention to every detail.
In packaging, even small details can have a big impact. This could include the quality of materials, the accuracy of labels, or the strength of seals.
Thou shalt not overlook final packing and shipping.
The final stages of packaging and shipping are crucial for ensuring the product reaches the customer in good condition. Take the time to make sure these steps are done correctly.
Thou shalt learn from the past.
Look at past successes and failures to inform future actions. This can provide valuable insights and prevent the repetition of past mistakes.

Four Mr beast style headlines for articles on the 4 major types of ai hallucinations and confabulations: 

1) Nonsensical. These are probably the least problematic kind, 
because they're the easiest to identify. 
2) Plausible, but incorrect. These are arguably the most prob- 
lematic kind, because they can be quite hard to identify— 
specif i cally because LLMs like GPT-4 have become so good 
at presenting information with convincing authority. 
3) Responses where the LLM seems to claim capacities it 
doesn't actually have, such as sentience or emotion, or (per 
Microsoft's Sydney) saying it could spy on users, order a 
pizza, or take any number of actions that language-predic- 
tion software can't actually do. 
4) Deliberate and destructive hallucinations, such as when a 
user prompts an LLM to generate false information that the user intends to use to mislead, confuse, or produce some other negative ef f ect.
