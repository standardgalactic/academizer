Original location of the Sphinx of Naxos, at
Delphi

The Sphinx of Naxos, also Sphinx of the Naxians,
now in the Archaeological Museum of Delphi, is a
2.22 meter tall marble statue of a sphinx, a
mythical creature with the head of a woman,
the chest and wings composed of the impressive
feathers of a prey bird turned upward, and
the body of a lioness. The Sphinx stood on a 10
meter column that culminated in one of the
first Ionic capitals, and was erected next to the
Temple of Apollo in Delphi, the religious
center of Ancient Greece, in 560 BCE.
The first fragments were excavated from the
sanctuary of the Temple of Apollo in 1860. The
remainder was found in 1893. It was originally
set up on a stele around 560 BC as an offering
to the Temple of Apollo by Naxos, one of the
richest Cycladic islands at the time. The
overall height of the statue, the column and
its base topped 12.5 meters.
The Greek sphinx, a lion with the face of a
human female, was considered as having
ferocious strength, and was thought of as a
guardian, often flanking the entrances to
temples.[1] Sphinxes depictions are generally

associated with architectural structures such
as royal tombs or religious temples.

Description[edit]
The famous Sphinx of the Naxians stood on a
column that culminated in an Ionic capital.

The statue of this mythical creature stood on a
towering Ionic column, which may have been the
oldest Ionic construction project in the site of
the Oracle of Delphi. Her statue had been set
up close to the Halos, the most sacred spot of
Delphi, where Apollo had presumably killed the
python. According to tradition and its
mythological representation, the Sphinx had the
face of a woman bearing an enigmatic smile, prey
bird wings, and the body of a lioness. It was
carved from a large piece of Naxian marble. The
solid construction combined elements that gave
the statue a character of motion and vitality,
such are the details that depict the hair, chest,
and wings.[2][3][4] It is also notable because it
is an early example of carving in-the-round, as

opposed to relief carving that was common
during that time.[5] The monument was made
entirely of marble and reached 12.45 meters in
height. The monument created awe to the
visitors and constituted a typical example of
Naxian sculpture in its peak period, i.e. in the
sixth century B.C.
On the base there was an inscription dated to
328-327 B.C., renewing the promanteia for the
Naxians:

ΔΕΛΦΟΙ ΑΠΕΔΩΚΑΝ ΝΑΞΙΟΙΣ ΤΑΝ

Thus, the Naxians had the right to acquire
oracles first.
Other columns[edit]
Many more similar columns crowned by sphinxes
were discovered in ancient Greece, as in Sparta,
Athens or Spata, and some were used as
funerary steles.[6]

It has also been suggested that 6th century
BCE Greek columns such as the Sphinx of Naxos
may have been an inspiration for the pillars of
Ashoka in 3rd century BCE India, following the
contacts initiated by Alexander the Great in
320 BCE, and continued by the Greco-Bactrians
and the Indo-Greeks.[6]
