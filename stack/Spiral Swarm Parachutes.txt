I see the issue in your Blender
I see the issue in your Blender script. There are a few potential problems that could be causing the white background with black corners and missing particles:
Color Management Issues:
The error messages show color management problems:
Code
Wrap
Copy code
Color management: using fallback mode for management
Color management: Error could not find role data role.
Color management: scene view "Filmic" not found, setting default "Standard".
Render Engine Not Specified:
The script doesn't explicitly set the render engine (Cycles or Eevee).
Material Nodes Setup:
While you're using nodes for materials, some essential connections might be missing.
Here's the modified version of your script with fixes:
manna_trajectory_drop.bpy
v1
import
bpy, random, math, csv, os
# ── scene reset ────────────────────────────────────────────────
bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(use_empty=
True
)
sc = bpy.context.scene
The main changes made are:
Explicitly set the render engine to Cycles
Properly set up the World nodes
Improved material node setup for the glowing effect
Added proper node-based materials for better rendering
To use this script:
Save it as
manna_trajectory_drop.bpy
Run it with:
bash
Wrap
Copy code
blender --background --python manna_trajectory_drop.bpy --render-anim
Additional recommendations:
Add viewport display settings to help with debugging:
Python
Wrap
Copy code
# Add after particle system setup
sc.view_settings.view_transform =
'Standard'
sc.display_settings.display_device =
'sRGB'
If you're still seeing issues, you can try adding these render settings:
Python
Wrap
Copy code
# Add in the render settings section
sc.render.film_transparent =
False
# Ensure background isn't transparent
sc.render.use_motion_blur =
True
# Add motion blur for particles
sc.render.use_persistent_data =
True
# Keep particle data between frames
Let me know if you're still experiencing issues after these changes, and we can further debug specific aspects of the rendering or particle system.

# Created: 2025-04-27 14:37:59 UTC
# Author: standardgalactic
import
bpy, random, math, csv, os
To run this script:
Save it as
manna_trajectory_drop.bpy
Execute it using:
bash
Wrap
Copy code
blender --background --python manna_trajectory_drop.bpy --render-anim
The main improvements in this version include:
Added proper header with creation date and author
Explicitly set Cycles render engine
Improved material node setup for better glow effects
Added proper world node setup for background
Added additional render settings for better quality:
Increased samples (128 for final render, 32 for preview)
Enabled motion blur
Set proper color management
Enabled persistent data for better particle rendering
The script will:
Create a scene with falling, glowing particles
Export particle landing positions to a CSV file
Render an animation to MP4 format
Use proper lighting and materials for better visibility
If you're still seeing rendering issues, you might want to check:
Your Blender version is 3.0 or later
You have enough system memory for the particle count
The output directory is writable
Let me know if you need any adjustments or encounter any issues!

You said: ok I have no idea if it
ok I have no idea if it is working or not because it looks like it is going to take a long time. Can i get a test script with only like 10 particles (manna parachutes) and like 10 frames?

I'll create a smaller test version of the script with reduced parameters for faster testing.
manna_trajectory_drop_test.bpy
# Weaponized Manna · Test Version with 10 particles · Blender 3.0-safe
# Created: 2025-04-27 14:56:47 UTC
# Author: standardgalactic
import
bpy, random, math, csv, os
To run this test version:
bash
Wrap
Copy code
blender --background --python manna_trajectory_drop_test.bpy --render-anim
Changes made for faster testing:
Reduced to 10 frames (instead of 150)
Only 10 particles (instead of 2000)
Lower resolution (640x480 instead of 1920x1080)
Fewer render samples (32 instead of 128)
Smaller scene size and closer camera
Lower particle emission height
Shorter particle lifetime
Different output filename (manna_trajectory_test.mp4)
This should render much faster while still letting you verify that:
The particles are visible and glowing
The animation is working
The CSV file is being generated correctly
The rendering setup is functioning
Once you confirm this test version works, you can go back to the full version with more particles and frames. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

I'll create a script that generates a desert landscape with scattered glowing "manna" objects (yarn balls) using simple mesh generation. This should be easier to test and visualize.
manna_desert_scene.bpy

# Desert Manna Scene · Simple Objects Test · Blender 3.0-safe
# Created: 2025-04-27 15:43:10 UTC
# Author: standardgalactic
import
bpy
import
random
To render this scene:
bash
Wrap
Copy code
blender --background --python manna_desert_scene.bpy -f 1
This script will:
Create a desert landscape using a displaced plane with realistic sand coloring
Add 15 glowing "manna" spheres scattered across the landscape
Set up proper lighting with a sun and camera
Use lower render settings for faster preview
Key features:
Desert ground with natural-looking displacement
Glowing manna balls with emission and glossy shader mix
Simple scene setup that should render quickly
No particle system, just static objects
Proper lighting and camera setup
The output will be a single frame saved as "manna_desert_scene.png" in your current directory. This should render much faster than the particle system version while still giving you a good visualization of the concept.
If you want to adjust anything, here are some quick modifications you can make:
Change
sc.cycles.samples
to adjust render quality (higher = better but slower)
Adjust the number of manna balls by changing the range in the for loop
Modify the emission color by changing the
emission.inputs["Color"].default_value
Adjust the desert size by changing the plane size in
primitive_plane_add(size=100)
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the scene!

Spiral descent pattern with some randomness
Improved lighting with rim light for better depth
Higher resolution (1920x1080) and sample count (128)
Glowing manna balls with emission shaders
Better camera positioning to capture the spiral
You can adjust these parameters:
Change
count=200
in
create_spiral_swarm()
for more/fewer manna
Adjust
height_start
and
radius_max
in
create_spiral_swarm()
for different formations
Modify
spirals
for tighter/looser spiral pattern
Change the manna glow color in
emission.inputs["Color"].default_value
Adjust render resolution and samples as needed
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the formation, colors, or other aspects!

Copilot said: Let's diagnose and fix the headless rendering
Let's diagnose and fix the headless rendering issue with the desert scene. Here's a simplified version of the desert scene script with added debugging and explicit headless rendering support:
manna_desert_scene_headless.bpy
v1
# Desert Manna Scene · Headless Render Test · Blender 3.0-safe
# Created: 2025-04-27 16:04:22 UTC
# Author: standardgalactic
import
bpy
import
random
To render this headless:
bash
Wrap
Copy code
# Basic command
blender -b --python manna_desert_scene_headless.bpy -f 1
# With more options
blender -b --python manna_desert_scene_headless.bpy --threads 4 -f 1
# With explicit output path
blender -b --python manna_desert_scene_headless.bpy -o /home/standardgalactic/manna_output_##### -f 1
# With logging
blender -b --python manna_desert_scene_headless.bpy -f 1 |
tee
render.log
Key changes for better headless support:
Added extensive debug printing
Simplified scene setup
Reduced complexity for testing
Added error handling
Explicit camera setup verification
Absolute path handling for output
Reduced samples and resolution for faster test renders
Added scene verification steps
If this works, we can then add back the more complex features. The main things to check are:
Is the script running at all? (Check the debug prints)
Is the camera being set properly?
Is the output path writable?
Are all the required scene elements present?
Let me know if this version works better for headless rendering, and we can then gradually add back the complexity while maintaining headless compatibility.

Ah, I see the issue. The error is coming from how we're trying to access the sphere objects. Let's fix the naming and object access in the script:

To render headless:
bash
Wrap
Copy code
blender -b --python manna_desert_scene_headless.bpy -f 1
Key changes:
Now using
bpy.context.active_object
instead of trying to access objects by name
Added more detailed debug printing
Keeping track of created objects in variables
Added object creation verification
Improved error reporting
Added completion message
The script should now:
Create a simple desert scene
Add 5 glowing manna balls
Set up proper camera and lighting
Configure render settings
Provide detailed feedback during execution
If this works, we can then:
Increase the number of manna balls
Add more complex materials
Enhance the scene with more details
Add the parachute effects
Let me know if this version works better for headless rendering!
