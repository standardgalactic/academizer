This paper introduces a precise correspondence between the theory of stochastic processes and 
quantum theory. This correspondence provides a new framework for using Hilbert-space methods to 
formulate highly generic types of stochastic dynamics, with potential applications throughout the 
sciences. This paper also uses the correspondence in the other direction to reconstruct quantum 
theory in general from physical models that consist of classical kinematics combined with stochastic 
dynamics. This reconstruction approach opens up new ways of understanding quantum-theoretic 
phenomena like interference, decoherence, entanglement, noncommutative observables, and wave- 
function collapse. 
I.INTRODUCTION 
The theory of stochastic processes describes the phe- 
nomenological behavior of systems with def i nite conf i g- 
urations that evolve in time according to probabilistic 
laws. Quantum theory is a comprehensive mathemati- 
cal apparatus for making measurement predictions when 
taking into account the microscopic constituents of var- 
ious kinds of physical systems, from subatomic particles 
to superconductors. At an empirical level, both theories 
involve probabilities, and at the level of formalism, both 
employ vectors and matrices. 
There have been a number of previous attempts in 
the literature to identify a fundamental relationship con- 
necting stochastic-processes theory and quantum the- 
ory [1-7]. This paper introduces a new and fully general 
correspondence between these two theories in the form 
of a simple 'dictionary' expressing any time-dependent 
stochastic matrix in terms of a suitable combination of 
Hilbert-space ingredients. 
On the one hand, from a practical standpoint, this 
'stochastic-quantum correspondence' provides a system- 
atic framework for constructing highly generic forms of 
stochastic dynamics, much as the classical Lagrangian or 
Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics provide 
systematic frameworks for constructing deterministic dy- 
namics. Potential applications range from turbulence to 
i nance, to name just two examples. Importantly, this 
stochastic-quantum correspondence does not require as- 
suming that the stochastic dynamics in question can be 
modeled as a Markov chain, nor does it require making 
any other frequently deployed approximations. 
Taking a more foundational perspective, this pa- 
per also uses this stochastic-quantum correspondence 
∗ barandes@g.harvard.edu 
to show that physical models based on classical kine- 
matics combined with stochastic dynamics can repli- 
cate all the empirical predictions of textbook quantum 
theory—including interference, decoherence, entangle- 
ment, noncommutative observables, and wave-function 
collapse—without relying on the austere and metaphys- 
ically opaque Dirac-von Neumann axioms [8, 9]. In this 
alternative approach, systems have physical conf i gura- 
tions in classical conf i guration spaces, and the mathe- 
matical objects of the Hilbert-space formulation serve a 
functional role akin to gauge-theoretic degrees of free- 
dom. 
In addition to establishing these new results, this pa- 
per identif i es several forms of gauge invariance that have 
not previously been described in the literature, analyzes 
the measurement process in detail, and describes the im- 
plications of the stochastic-quantum correspondence for 
dynamical symmetries and for formal enlargements or di- 
lations of a system's Hilbert space. Taking advantage of 
having a concrete model of stochastic hidden variables in 
hand, this paper also revisits and clarif i es a number of 
important questions related to the status of nonlocality 
in quantum theory. 
Given the mathematical simplicity of this stochastic- 
quantum correspondence, it is surprising that it has ap- 
parently not shown up in the literature before. To the au- 
thor's knowledge, the only previous example that bears 
a suggestive resemblance to the approach taken in this 
paper, at least at the level of some of its equations, is the 
unpublished draft [6].1Although that reference argues 
that some stochastic processes can be modeled using a 
formalism similar to that of quantum theory, it does not 
establish that the resulting Hilbert-space representation 
is fully general. Nor does it attempt to show that the 
correspondence is bidirectional, so that quantum systems 
can be modeled by stochastic processes on classical con- 
i guration spaces.

2 II.STOCHASTIC PROCESSES 
In the theory of stochastic processes [10], one starts 
with a conf i guration space C and a stochastic map Γ(t) 
that acts linearly on probability distributions over C at 
an initial time t = 0 to yield corresponding probability 
distributions over C at other times t 6= 0. The formalism 
is easiest to express in the case in which C has a i nite 
number N of conf i gurations labeled by positive integers 
1,...,N: C ≡ {1,...,N}.(1) 
In that case, the probabilities at t = 0 can be denoted by 
pj(0)[j = 1,...,N],(2) 
the probabilities at t 6= 0 can be denoted by 
pi(t)[i = 1,...,N],(3) 
and the stochastic map consists of conditional probabili- 
ties Γij(t) ≡ p(i,t|j,0)[i,j 
= 1,...,N],(4) 
where p(i,t|j,0) denotes the conditional probability for 
the system to be in its ith conf i guration at the time t, 
given that it is in its jth conf i guration at the time 0. 
(Note that no assumption is made here about whether 
t > 0 or t < 0.)Being probabilities, these quantities 
satisfy pj(0),pi(t) ≥ 0, 
N X 
j=1 
pj(0) = 
N X 
i=1 
pi(t) = 1,(5) 
and Γij(t) ≥ 0, 
N X 
i=1 
Γij(t) = 1.(6) 
Then from marginalization, one has the linear relation- 
ship pi(t) = 
N X 
j=1 
Γij(t)pj(0),(7) 
where the initial probabilities pj(0) are arbitrary and can 
therefore be freely adjusted without altering the condi- 
tional probabilities Γij(t). 
Letting p(0) denote the N × 1 column vector with en- 
tries given by the probabilities pj(0), letting p(t) denote 
the analogous N × 1 vector with entries given by pi(t), 
and letting Γ(t) denote the time-dependent N × N ma- 
trix consisting of the conditional probabilities Γij(t), one 
can recast the linear relationship (7) in matrix form as 
p(t) = Γ(t)p(0).(8) 
The conditions (6) on Γ(t) identify it as a (left) stochastic 
matrix. On physical grounds, Γ(t) will be assumed to 
satisfy the continuity condition that in the limit t → 0, 
it approaches the N × N identity matrix 1: 
lim 
t→0 Γ(t) = 1 ≡ diag(1,...,1).(9) 
Next, consider a random variable A(t) with (not nec- 
essarily unique) magnitudes a1(t),...,aN(t) determined 
by the system's conf i guration i = 1,...,N, and possibly 
also depending explicitly on the time t. Then the expec- 
tation value hA(t)i is def i ned as the statistical average 
or mean of the magnitudes of A(t) over the probability 
distribution at t: 
hA(t)i ≡ 
N X 
i=1 
ai(t)pi(t) = 
N X 
i=1 
N X 
j=1 
ai(t)Γij(t)pj(0).(10) 
One can go on to def i ne the standard deviation and var- 
ious statistical moments of A(t) by appropriate general- 
izations of this basic def i nition. 
All these formulas can be extended to systems with 
continuous conf i guration spaces.For a system with a 
continuous conf i guration space C, one uses probability 
densities p(y,0) at t = 0 and p(x,t) at t 6= 0, where 
x and y each symbolically denotes a set of real-valued 
coordinates. The linear relationship (7) then

The paper proposes a correspondence between stochastic processes and quantum theory that provides a new framework for using Hilbert-space methods to formulate stochastic dynamics. The correspondence allows the reconstruction of quantum theory from physical models that combine classical kinematics with stochastic dynamics. The paper also identifies several forms of gauge invariance, analyzes the measurement process, and clarifies important questions related to the status of nonlocality in quantum theory. The correspondence has potential applications throughout the sciences, and its bidirectionality allows for a better understanding of quantum-theoretic phenomena.

On physical grounds, Γ(t) will be assumed to 
satisfy the continuity condition that in the limit t → 0, 
it approaches the N × N identity matrix 1: 
lim 
t→0 Γ(t) = 1 ≡ diag(1,...,1).(9) 
Next, consider a random variable A(t) with (not nec- 
essarily unique) magnitudes a1(t),...,aN(t) determined 
by the system's conf i guration i = 1,...,N, and possibly 
also depending explicitly on the time t. Then the expec- 
tation value hA(t)i is def i ned as the statistical average 
or mean of the magnitudes of A(t) over the probability 
distribution at t: 
hA(t)i ≡ 
N X 
i=1 
ai(t)pi(t) = 
N X 
i=1 
N X 
j=1 
ai(t)Γij(t)pj(0).(10) 
One can go on to def i ne the standard deviation and var- 
ious statistical moments of A(t) by appropriate general- 
izations of this basic def i nition. 
All these formulas can be extended to systems with 
continuous conf i guration spaces.For a system with a 
continuous conf i guration space C, one uses probability 
densities p(y,0) at t = 0 and p(x,t) at t 6= 0, where 
x and y each symbolically denotes a set of real-valued 
coordinates. The linear relationship (7) then becomes 
p(x,t) = Z C 
dµ(y)Γ(x,y,t)p(y,0),(11) 
where dµ(y) is a suitable integral measure over C and 
where the conditional probability density Γ(x,y,t) natu- 
rally serves as an integral kernel. A random variable A(t) 
then has magnitudes a(x,t) labeled by x and t, and its 
expectation value (10) becomes 
hA(t)i ≡ Z C 
dµ(x)a(x,t)p(x,t) 
= Z C 
dµ(x) Z C 
dµ(y)a(x,t)Γ(x,y,t)p(y,0).       

For ease of exposition, the discrete case will be assumed 
going forward. 
Equations like (7), (9), and (11) may appear to single 
out t = 0 as a special time. Section IX, however, will 
show that for systems in suf i ciently strong contact with 
a noisy environment, t = 0 need not actually be a unique 
time, but will typically be only

one of many possible timescales that can be probed by the system. This is because the noise from the environment can introduce a range of characteristic timescales into the system's dynamics, and the system's response to this noise can depend on the specific timescale of the perturbation. In such cases, the statistical properties of the system may depend not only on the initial distribution of states at t=0, but also on the history of the system's interaction with the environment over some finite time interval. This leads to the concept of non-equilibrium steady states, where the system maintains a persistent flow of energy, matter, or information, despite being driven away from equilibrium by the interaction with its environment. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics provides a framework for studying the emergence of such states and their properties.

← t 
0). (123) 
XIV.WAVE-FUNCTION COLLAPSE 
Importantly, notice also that one can write the hybrid 
stochastic matrix (122) in an overall form that resembles 
the dictionary (26): 
ΓSD 
i,d(α0)(t ← t 
0) 
= tr(US†(t ← t0)PS 
i U(t ← t0)˜PS 
α). ) 
(124) 
Rearranging the right-hand side gives the equation 
ΓSD 
i,d(α0)(t ← t 
0) = tr(PS 
i ρS|α 0,t0(t)), (125) 
with a 'conditional' density matrix ρS|α 0,t0(t) for the sub- 
ject system at the time t > t0naturally def i ned by time- 
evolving the eigenprojector ˜ 
PS 
α0 from t0> 0 to t > t0: 
ρS|α 0,t0(t) ≡ U(t ← t0) 
˜ 
PS 
α0U S†(t ← t0). 
(126) 
Thus, the calculation (117) reduces to the statement 
that the standalone probabilities pS 
i(t) for the subject 
system at t > t0are given by 
pS 
i(t) = tr(P S 
i ρS(t)),(127) 
where the subject system's density matrix ρS(t), which 
was originally def i ned in (119), can equivalently be ex- 
pressed as a probabilistic mixture of the conditional 
density matrices ρS|α 0,t0(t) def i ned in (126), statistically 
weighted by the measurement probabilities pD 
d(α0)(t 0): 
ρS(t) ≡ X 
α0 
ρS|α 0,t0(t)pD 
d(α0)(t 0). (128) 
Taking stock of these results, one sees that to make fu- 
ture predictions for t > t0about the subject system, con- 
ditioned on the measuring device's result d(α0) at t0> 0, 
one ef f ectively replaces the subject system's density ma- 
trix with the conditional density matrix ρS|α 0,t0(t), cor- 
responding to a 'collapsed' state vector or wave function 
def i ned as ΨS|α 0,t0(t) ≡ U(t ← t0)˜ 
e α. (129) 
By contrast, for an observer who does not know the spe- 
cif i c measurement result d(α0), the correct density matrix 
ρS(t) to use is the one def i ned in (128), which, again, con- 
sists of an appropriate mixture of conditional or collapsed 
density matrices probabilistically weighted over the mea- 
surement results. 
XV.THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM 
According to the foregoing analysis, measuring devices 
are ordinary physical systems that carry out measure- 
ments of observables, and then end up in i nal conf i gu- 
rations that ref l ect def i nite measurement outcomes, with 
the probabilities for those various measurement outcomes 
given by the Born rule. Hence, the picture of quantum 
theory presented in this paper arguably has the resources 
to solve the measurement problem [36]. 
The stochastic-quantum correspondence is also helpful 
for understanding the measurement process in another 
important way.Textbook treatments of quantum the- 
ory typically regard measuring devices as metaphysical 
primitives or posits, without providing clear principles 
15 
for deciding which kinds of systems merit being called 
measuring devices and which do not. The approach taken 
toward the measurement process in this paper not only 
gives a candidate resolution of the measurement problem, 
but also yields a natural set of criteria for def i ning what 
counts as a good measuring device, without the need to 
regard measuring devices as special among all other sys- 
tems in any truly fundamental way. 
Based on the approach in this paper, a good measuring 
device should be a physical system with at least as many 
conf i gurations as possible outcomes for the observable to 
be measured (at least up to the desired level of experi- 
mental resolution), it should admit an overall form of dy- 
namics that results in the correct i nal correlations, and 
it should be in suf i ciently strong contact with a noisy 
environment to generate a robust division event at the 
conclusion of the measurement interaction. It is worth 
noting that the i rst two of these three criteria would 
be standard requirements for a measuring device even 
without worrying about indivisible stochastic dynamics 
or quantum theory. 
XVI.SYMMETRIES 
The stochastic-quantum correspondence developed in 
this paper provides new ways to think about dynamical 
symmetries in quantum theory. Going in the other direc- 
tion, the stochastic-quantum correspondence also makes 
it more straightforward to impose dynamical symmetries 
systematically as constraints in the construction of the 
dynamics for a given stochastic model. 
Classically, any invertible transformation of a system's 
conf i gurations i = 1,...,N is a permutation transforma- 
tion of the conf i guration projectors (21): 
Pi7→ Pσ(i), 
with {σ(1),...,σ(N)} = {1,...,N}. ) 
(130) 
More generally, a transformation between two PVMs 
P1,...,PNand ˜ 
P1,..., ˜ 
PNis always a similarity trans- 
formation of the form 
Pi7→ 
˜ 
Pi≡ V †PiV, (131) 
where V is some unitary operator.20This similarity 
transformation reduces to the conf i gurational transfor- 
mation (130) if and only if V is a permutation matrix. 
20 Proof:Let e1,...,eNbe the orthonormal conf i guration basis 
(28), with e† iej = δijand eie† 
i = Pi, and let ˜ e1,..., ˜ eNbe an or- 
thonormal basis related to the new projectors ˜ 
Piin the analogous 
way, with ˜ e† 
i˜ ej = δijand ˜ ei˜ e† 
i = ˜ 
Pi. Then the N × N matrix 
def i ned by V ≡ P 
iei˜ e † 
i is unitary and satisf i es V†PiV = ˜ 
Pi. 
Going the other way, if V is a unitary N × N matrix, then the 
N × N matrices def i ned for i = 1,...,N by 
˜ 
Pi≡ V†PiV 
are 
guaranteed to constitute a PVM. QED 
The more general transformation (131) leaves the 
stochastic dynamics invariant precisely if the right-hand 
side of the stochastic-quantum dictionary (26) remains 
unchanged: 
tr(Θ†(t)˜PiΘ(t)˜Pj) = tr(Θ†(t)PiΘ(t)Pj).(132) 
This condition is equivalent to the statement that 
tr(˜Θ†(t)Pi˜Θ(t)Pj) = tr(Θ†(t)PiΘ(t)Pj),(133) 
where ˜ 
Θ(t) ≡ V Θ(t)V 
†. (134) 
Re-expressing both sides of the equivalent condition (133) 
in terms of squared absolute values, as in (17), one sees 
that (134) is a dynamical symmetry precisely if 
|˜Θij(t)|2= |Θij(t)|2.(135) 
It follows immediately that ˜ 
Θ(t) can dif f er from Θ(t) 
by at most a Schur-Hadamard gauge transformation (42), 
meaning that a necessary and suf i cient condition for a 
unitary matrix V to give a dynamical symmetry is that 
V Θ(t)V † = Θ(t) ?    
eiθ11(t)eiθ12(t) 
eiθ21(t) ... eiθNN(t)   . 
(136) 
As special cases, this condition includes unitary dynam- 
ical symmetries, V Θ(t)V † = Θ(t),(137) 
as well as anti-unitary dynamical symmetries,

This passage is discussing the stochastic-quantum correspondence and its application to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. The passage argues that measuring devices are ordinary physical systems that perform measurements of observables and end up in final configurations that reflect definite measurement outcomes, with the probabilities for those various measurement outcomes given by the Born rule. The passage also explains that the approach taken toward the measurement process in this paper not only gives a candidate resolution of the measurement problem, but also yields a natural set of criteria for defining what counts as a good measuring device. Finally, the passage discusses how the stochastic-quantum correspondence provides new ways to think about dynamical symmetries in quantum theory and makes it more straightforward to impose dynamical symmetries systematically as constraints in the construction of the dynamics for a given stochastic model.

XVII.DILATIONS 
In most textbook treatments of quantum theory, a 
quantum system is axiomatically def i ned as a particular 
Hilbert space together with a preferred set of self-adjoint 
operators designated as observables with predetermined 
physical meanings, along with a particular Hamiltonian 
to def i ne the system's time evolution.22From that point 
of view, modifying a system's Hilbert-space formulation 
in any nontrivial way would necessarily mean fundamen- 
tally modifying the system itself. 
From the alternative point of view developed in this 
paper, by contrast, a Hilbert-space formulation is merely 
a collection of mathematical tools for constructing the 
dynamics of a given stochastic system. The system it- 
self is ultimately def i ned by a conf i guration space and 
a dynamical law that stand apart from any arbitrary 
choice of Hilbert-space formulation. As a consequence, 
one is free to modify a system's Hilbert-space formula- 
tion as needed, much like changing from one gauge choice 
to another in a gauge theory, or like adding physically 
meaningless variables to the Lagrangian formulation of a 
deterministic classical system. 
With this motivation in place, recall again the basic 
stochastic-quantum dictionary (26): 
Γij(t) = tr(Θ†(t)PiΘ(t)Pj).(141) 
The Hilbert-space formulation expressed by the right- 
hand side can be manipulated for convenience, provided 
that the left-hand side of the dictionary remains un- 
changed. 
In particular, for an integer D ≥ 2, one can freely en- 
large, or dilate, the Hilbert-space formulation to a larger 
dimension ND by the following dilation transformation: 
Θ(t) 7→ Θ(t) ⊗ 1I, 
Pi(t) 7→ Pi(t) ⊗ 1I, 
Pj(t) 7→ Pj(t) ⊗ PI 
γ.      
(142) 
22 In some circumstances, it may turn out to be more convenient to 
def i ne a quantum system by a formal C*-algebra of observables 
alone, without picking a specif i c Hilbert-space representation. 
Here 1Iis the D ×D identity matrix on a new 'internal' 
Hilbert space HI, 
and PI 
1,...,P I 
D collectively form any 
PVM on that internal Hilbert space satisfying the usual 
conditions of mutual exclusivity, 
PI 
γP I 
γ0 = δγγ0PI 
γ, (143) 
and completeness, D X 
γ=1 
PI 
γ = 1I.(144) 
It is then a mathematical identity that one can rewrite 
the stochastic-quantum dictionary as 
Γij(t) = tr?trI??Θ†(t) 
⊗ 1I??Pi⊗ 1I? 
× ?Θ(t) 
⊗ 1I??P 
j⊗ P 
I 
γ ???, ) 
(145) 
with a second trace over the internal Hilbert space HI. 
The choice of value for the label γ here is immaterial, with 
dif f erent choices of γ related by gauge transformations. 
One can equivalently write the dilated form of the dic- 
tionary in block-matrix form as 
Γij(t) = trI ? 
[Θij(t)]I†[Θij(t)]IPI 
γ ? 
.(146) 
Here [Θij(t)]Iis a diagonal D × D matrix consisting of 
repeated copies of the specif i c entry Θij(t) (for i xed i,j) 
along the diagonal, [Θij(t)]I≡ Θij(t)1I,(147) 
and the adjoint operation † in (146) acts on this D × 
D block matrix [Θij(t)]I, so it does not transpose the 
indices i and j on the N × N matrix Θij(t) 
itself, 
[Θij(t)]I†≡ [Θij(t)] I. (148) 
In this dilated version of the Hilbert-space formula- 
tion, the Schur-Hadamard gauge transformation (42) is 
enhanced to the following local-in-time gauge transfor- 
mation, which has not yet been described in the litera- 
ture: [Θij(t)]I7→ V 
I 
(ij)(t)[Θij(t)] I. (149) 
Here V I 
(ij)(t) are a set of N 
2 unitary D × D matrices, 
where each such unitary matrix as a whole is labeled by 
a specif i c pair (ij) of conf i guration labels: 
V I† 
(ij)(t) = (V I 
(ij)(t)) −1. (150) 
The gauge transformations (149) will not generally pre- 
serve the factorization Θ(t) ⊗ 1Iappearing 
in (145), so 
they motivate considering more general ND×ND time- 
evolution operators ˜ 
Θ(t), in terms of which the dilated 
dictionary (145) takes the form 
Γij(t) = tr ? 
trI ? 
˜ Θ†(t)?Pi⊗ 1I?˜Θ(t)?Pj⊗ 
PI 
γ ???. 
(151) 
17 
Any ND×ND matrix 
˜ 
Θ(t) appearing on the right-hand 
side of this dictionary is guaranteed to lead to a valid 
stochastic matrix Γij(t) on the left-hand side, so working 
with a dilated Hilbert-space formulation essentially pro- 
vides a larger 'canvas' for designing stochastic matrices. 
As a simple example of a dilation for the case D = 2, 
one can formally eliminate the complex numbers from a 
quantum system's Hilbert space [38]. Specif i cally, by in- 
creasing the system's Hilbert-space dimension from N to 
2N, one can replace the imaginary unit i ≡ √−1 with 
the real-valued 2 × 2 matrix ? 
0 −1 
10 ?, 
with the enhanced 
version (149) of the Schur-Hadamard gauge transforma- 
tion now consisting of two-dimensional rotations of the 
internal Hilbert space HI. 
One can then represent the 
complex-conjugation operator K appearing in (139) as 
the 2 × 2 matrix (0 
1 
1 0). The result is that all unitary 
and anti-unitary operators become 2N × 2N orthogonal 
matrices.One cost in using this 'real' representation, 
however, is that the Hilbert spaces of composite systems 
do not factorize as neatly into Hilbert spaces for their 
constituent subsystems.23 
As a somewhat more signif i cant application of dila- 
tions, recall that any stochastic matrix Γij(t) has a Kraus 
decomposition (48): 
Γij(t) = 
N X 
β=1 
tr(K† β(t)PiKβ(t)Pj). (152) 
The Stinespring dilation theorem [39] then guarantees 
that by an appropriate dilation to a larger Hilbert space 
if necessary, one can express Γij(t) in terms of a unitary 
time-evolution operator ˜ 
U(t): 
Γij(t) = tr ? 
trI ? 
˜ U†(t)?Pi⊗ 1I?˜U(t)?Pj⊗ 
PI 
γ ???. 
(153) 
This fact makes clear the inevitability of unitary time 
evolution in quantum theory.24 
23 Without increasing the dimension N of a system's Hilbert space, 
one could instead attempt to limit the appearance of the com- 
plex numbers in a system's Hilbert-space formulation by using 
the original Schur-Hadamard gauge transformation (42) to make 
all the entries of the system's time-evolution operator Θ(t) real- 
valued.In this alternative approach, however, a unistochastic 
matrix Γ(t) may not be expressible in terms of a unitary or or- 
thogonal time-evolution operator, and the complex numbers will 
generally still be needed anyway to def i ne various observables. 
24 From the starting assumptions presented here, one can sketch 
the following proof: Given N × N Kraus matrices Kβ(t), 
with 
β = 1,...,N, def i ne an N3× N2matrix 
˜ 
V (t) according to 
˜ 
V(iβm)(jl)(t) ≡ Kβ,ij(t)δlm, 
treating (iβm) as the i rst index 
of ˜ 
V (t) and treating (jl) as its second index. One can show that 
this matrix satisf i es ˜ 
V†(t)˜V (t) = 1N2×N2, 
so it def i nes a partial 
isometry, which can always be extended to a unitary N3×N3ma- 
trix˜U(iβm)(jγ)(t) by adding N3−N2additional 
columns that are 
mutually orthogonal with each other and with the previous N2 
As another application, a dilated Hilbert-space formu- 
lation can make it possible to introduce new kinds of 
emergeables. Some of these emergeables may be observ- 
ables that can yield def i nite results in measurement pro- 
cesses, along the lines of Section XIII, despite not having 
a direct meaning at the level of the system's underlying 
conf i guration space. In this way, a stochastically evolv- 
ing system based on a classical conf i guration space can 
easily accommodate emergent observables that model all 
kinds of quantum-theoretic phenomena. Indeed, obtain- 
ing a unitary time-evolution operator for a given system 
may require dilating the Hilbert space in just this way, 
as in (153). 
An important example of this last application is intrin- 
sic spin. To introduce spin as an emergeable, one merely 
dilates the Hilbert space to ND dimensions, introduces 
a D-dimensional representation of SO(3) for the internal 
Hilbert space, and then requires that the dilated time- 
evolution operator has the appropriate form of rotation 
symmetry.

This excerpt is from a scientific paper discussing quantum theory and the Hilbert space formulation of a stochastic system. The authors argue that a Hilbert-space formulation is simply a collection of mathematical tools for constructing the dynamics of a given stochastic system, and that modifying the Hilbert-space formulation does not necessarily modify the system itself. They propose a dilation transformation that enlarges the Hilbert space to a larger dimension, and show how this transformation can be used to manipulate the Hilbert-space formulation for convenience. The authors describe how the stochastic-quantum dictionary can be rewritten in terms of this dilation transformation and a second trace over an internal Hilbert space. They also introduce a local-in-time gauge transformation that enhances the Schur-Hadamard gauge transformation. Overall, the excerpt presents a novel perspective on the role of the Hilbert space in quantum theory and proposes a new method for manipulating the Hilbert-space formulation of a stochastic system.

XVIII.NONLOCALITY 
This paper has shown that systems with classical 
conf i guration spaces and indivisible stochastic dynamics 
have Hilbert-space representations and can replicate the 
usual mathematical formalism and empirical predictions 
of quantum theory. 
The classical conf i gurations in this new picture for 
quantum theory essentially play the role of hidden vari- 
ables.The term 'hidden variables' immediately raises 
questions about the potential invocation of nonlocal dy- 
namics, the study of which has motivated famous papers 
like [40] and has led to the development of a number of 
important theorems [35, 41-43]. 
Before assessing the implications of these theorems for 
the picture described in this paper, it will be important to 
note that these theorems do not rule out the possibility of 
hidden variables altogether. Nor do these theorems imply 
that introducing hidden variables would necessarily make 
quantum theory any more dynamically nonlocal than it 
already is. 
Being mindful of those caveats, there is ample reason to 
probe the question of nonlocal dynamics in the approach 
to quantum theory taken in this paper. After all, looking 
back at the discussion of entanglement in Section XI, a 
pair of systems that interact at some time will generically 
exhibit what look like nonlocal stochastic dynamics after 
that time, at least until the later occurrence of a division 
event due to decoherence by an external system.

The paper being referred to in this excerpt suggests that classical systems with stochastic dynamics can be represented in a Hilbert space, similar to quantum theory, and that classical configurations can serve as hidden variables. However, the potential invocation of nonlocal dynamics raises questions, and the paper acknowledges the existence of theorems that address this topic.
The excerpt also notes that these theorems do not rule out the possibility of hidden variables in general, nor do they necessarily make quantum theory any more nonlocal than it already is. However, the paper acknowledges the need to probe the question of nonlocal dynamics in this approach to quantum theory, particularly in light of the discussion of entanglement in Section XI. The excerpt suggests that a pair of interacting systems can exhibit nonlocal dynamics after that interaction until decoherence by an external system occurs.

QED 
18 In what follows, it will be important to be keep in mind 
the distinction between deterministic hidden-variables 
theories and stochastic hidden-variables theories. 
Bell's original nonlocality theorem, as formulated and 
proved in [41], only addressed the case of a deterministic 
hidden-variables theory. Specif i cally, Bell showed that if 
one assumes that a theory's hidden variables uniquely de- 
termine measurement outcomes, and if one also assumes 
that local measurement results should not depend on the 
settings of faraway measuring devices, then one arrives 
at an inequality that is expressly violated by quantum 
theory. 
There seemed to be just two available options in re- 
sponse to this nonlocality theorem. One could either ac- 
cept a theory of nonlocal deterministic hidden variables, 
or deny the existence of deterministic hidden variables 
and thereby avoid having to introduce any dynamical 
nonlocality into quantum theory. 
However,for a hidden-variables theory based on 
stochastic dynamics rather than deterministic dynamics, 
the question of dynamical nonlocality becomes murkier. 
The generalization to stochastic dynamics means that 
one needs to rely on more abstract, statistical conditions 
for establishing whether the theory's hidden variables be- 
have in a dynamically local manner. 
The most frequently cited statistical locality criterion 
for stochastic hidden-variables theories was formulated 
by Bell later on [35, 44, 45].That statistical locality 
criterion is a statement about how rich a theory's hidden 
variables should be in order for the theory to qualify as 
dynamically local. 
To formulate this statistical locality criterion, start by 
considering the case of a measurement outcome x based 
on local measurement settings a, and a far-separated 
measurement outcome y based on local measurement 
settings b.Then suppose that the joint probabilities 
p(x,y|a,b) for the measurement results x and y, con- 
ditioned on the measurement settings a and b, show a 
statistical correlation. Bell argued that in order for the 
theory in question to be considered dynamically local, 
the theory should contain enough hidden variables to ac- 
count for the statistical correlation in the following pre- 
cise sense: if one conditions on all the hidden variables λ 
in the past light cone of the two measurements, then the 
joint probabilities should factorize according to 
p(x,y|a,b,λ) = p(x,a|λ)p(y,b|λ).(154) 
Bell's statistical locality criterion is precisely the con- 
dition that the theory in question should have enough 
hidden variables to ensure that the factorization (154) is 
always possible. Based on this statistical locality crite- 
rion, which should hold even in cases of 'one-shot' mea- 
surements in which certain measurement outcomes can 
be assigned a probability of 1 [43], one can again derive 
predictions that are violated by quantum theory, just as 
in the case of a deterministic hidden-variables theory. 
However, this statistical locality criterion is broader 
than the conditions Bell studied in his earlier work on 
deterministic hidden-variables theories in [41]. Bell's sta- 
tistical locality condition is so broad, in fact, that Bell 
used it to argue that textbook quantum theory is itself 
dynamically nonlocal [35, 46]. 
To understand why, observe that textbook quantum 
theory is committed to the existence of measurement set- 
tings and def i nite measurement outcomes that end up be- 
having precisely as a (highly incomplete) set of stochas- 
tically evolving hidden variables.In other words, al- 
though textbook quantum theory is not a deterministic 
hidden-variables theory, it is, in fact, a stochastic hidden- 
variables theory. 
The stochastic-quantum correspondence makes these 
commitments by textbook quantum theory manifest. In- 
deed, one can regard textbook quantum theory as the 
insistence that for any measurement set-up consisting of 
a subject system S, a measuring device D, and an envi- 
ronment E, as laid out in Section XIII, the conf i gurations 
of D are to be treated as hidden variables (that is, as be- 
ables), whereas the conf i gurations of S and E are to be 
regarded merely as emergeables. 
This seemingly arbitrary division of the world into 
measuring devices, which truly have underlying conf i g- 
urations, and all other systems, which do not, leads di- 
rectly to all the usual mysteries about the measurement 
process according to textbook quantum theory. What, in 
the end, determines whether a given system counts as a 
measuring device, and therefore merits having underlying 
conf i gurations? 
More relevant to the present discussion is that be- 
cause textbook quantum theory includes stochastic hid- 
den variables for measuring devices, and because those 
stochastic hidden variables are insuf i cient to ensure the 
factorization property (154), the nonlocality theorems 
that employ Bell's statistical locality criterion imply that 
textbook quantum theory is itself dynamically nonlocal. 
Hence, there is no real cost to upgrading the conf i gura- 
tions of S and E to being hidden variables on an equal 
footing with the conf i gurations of D. These additional 
hidden variables do not lead to the factorization property 
(154) either, but they also do not lead to any trouble for 
the no-communication theorem [47, 48], which precludes 
using quantum theory to send controllable signals faster 
than light.

[9], the Kochen-Specker theorem [49], the 
Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem [50], and Myrvold's no- 
go theorem [51]. These theorems either assume that all 
observables are true random variables (that is, beables) 
that exist at the level of the given system's conf i gura- 
tion space, or they assume that measurements are pas- 
sive operations that merely reveal pre-existing values of 
observables without altering the behavior of measured 
systems in the process, or they assume the existence of 
additional probability formulas. Because the picture of 
quantum theory introduced in this paper refrains from 
making any of these assumptions, it is consistent with 
these theorems. XIX.DISCUSSION 
This paper has shown that one can reconstruct the 
mathematical formalism and predictions of quantum the- 
ory using simpler, more physically transparent axioms 
than the standard Dirac-von Neumann axioms. Rather 
than postulating Hilbert spaces and their ingredients 
from the beginning, one instead posits a physical model 
based on classical kinematics and generically indivisible 
stochastic dynamics. 
This new axiomatic approach naturally suggests a new 
interpretation of quantum theory grounded in the theory 
of stochastic processes. According to this highly adapt- 
able interpretation, which one could naturally call the 
'indivisible interpretation' of quantum theory, systems 
have underlying physical conf i gurations in conf i guration 
spaces at all times, and their dynamics is no more or less 
nonlocal than the dynamics of textbook quantum theory. 
From this perspective, density matrices, wave func- 
tions, and other appurtenances of Hilbert spaces, while 
highly useful, are merely gauge variables and should not 
be assigned direct physical meanings or treated as though 
they directly represent physical objects, any more than 
a Lagrangian or a Hamilton's principal function directly 
describe physical objects. Superposition is then not a lit- 
eral smearing of physical objects, but is merely a math- 
ematical artifact of catching a system in the middle of 
an indivisible stochastic process, as represented using a 
Hilbert-space formulation and wave functions. Moreover, 
from this standpoint, 'canonical quantization' need not 
be regarded as the promotion of classical observables to 
noncommutative operators by i at, but can be imple- 
mented (when mathematically feasible) simply by gen- 
eralizing a classical system's dynamics from being deter- 
ministic to being stochastic, with all the exotic features 
of quantum theory then emerging automatically. 
Because the indivisible interpretation invokes hidden 
variables in the form of underlying physical conf i gura- 
tions, this approach to quantum theory shares some fea- 
tures with the de Broglie-Bohm formulation, or Bohmian 
mechanics [52-54]. However, in contrast to the indivis- 
ible interpretation, Bohmian mechanics employs deter- 
ministic dynamics, and features a guiding equation that 
fundamentally breaks Lorentz invariance by singling out 
a preferred foliation of spacetime into spacelike hyper- 
surfaces. The indivisible interpretation instead takes se- 
riously what experiments strongly suggest—that the dy- 
namics of quantum theory is indeterministic. 
In contrast with the Everett interpretation [55, 56], 
the indivisible interpretation assumes that quantum sys- 
tems, like classical systems, have def i nite conf i gurations 
in conf i guration spaces, and does not attempt to derive 
probability from non-probabilistic assumptions or grap- 
ple with fundamental aspects of personal identity in a 
universe continuously branching into large numbers of 
parallel worlds. The approach in this paper is therefore 
more modest, metaphysically speaking, than the Everett 
interpretation. Neither the indivisible interpretation nor 
the Everett interpretation satisf i es the statistical local- 
ity criterion described in Section XVIII, but the Ev- 
erett interpretation arguably exhibits a dif f erent notion 
of dynamical locality at a level of description that tran- 
scends its individual world-branches [57]. However, be- 
cause each individual world-branch looks no more or less 
nonlocal than the world according to textbook quantum 
theory or the indivisible interpretation, it is not clear 
what concrete benef i ts the Everett interpretation's dy- 
namical locality truly provide. 
Unlike stochastic-collapse theories [58, 59], the indivis- 
ible interpretation does not entail any fundamental viola- 
tions of unitarity, nor does it require introducing any new 
constants of nature to specify dynamical-collapse rates. 
The indivisible interpretation shares some features 
with the modal interpretations [60-62], including an in- 
sistence that systems always have def i nite conf i gurations 
of some kind at every moment in time, while assigning 
at least some forms of probability a law-like, objective 
role. In particular, like the minimal modal interpreta- 
tion [63], the indivisible interpretation uses conditional 
probabilities in a central way.One dif f erence between 
the indivisible interpretation and most of the modal in- 
terpretations, however, is the insistence by the indivis- 
ible interpretation that the def i nite conf i guration of a 
given system is an element of a classical-looking conf i gu- 
ration space, rather than corresponding more abstractly 
to features of a Hilbert space. The indivisible interpreta- 
tion also avoids some of the ontological instabilities that 
are a serious challenge for most of the modal interpreta- 
tions [64]. 
Looking forward,it would be interesting to see 
what implications the stochastic-quantum correspon- 
dence could have for both phenomenological stochastic 
systems, like those in biology or i nance, as well as for fu- 
ture work in fundamental physics, like quantum gravity.

More broadly, by recasting the Hilbert-space formu- 
lation of quantum theory as merely a convenient way 
to represent stochastic processes, one opens the door to 
searching for totally dif f erent representations that might 
look nothing at all like Hilbert spaces and that could al- 
low for the construction of more general kinds of stochas- 
tic processes. Perhaps one could even i nd a way to gen- 
eralize beyond stochastic processes altogether.

Yes, it's possible that alternative representations of quantum theory could be developed that do not rely on the concept of Hilbert spaces. These new representations may offer insights into more general types of stochastic processes, or perhaps even lead to a more fundamental theory that goes beyond the limitations of quantum mechanics.
There are already some attempts to develop alternative formulations of quantum theory, such as the so-called "quantum Bayesianism" or "QBism" approach, which emphasizes the role of subjective probabilities in quantum measurements. Other approaches include "Bohmian mechanics," which proposes a non-local hidden-variable theory that reproduces the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.

This paper introduces a precise correspondence between the theory of stochastic processes and 
quantum theory. This correspondence provides a new framework for using Hilbert-space methods to 
formulate highly generic types of stochastic dynamics, with potential applications throughout the 
sciences. This paper also uses the correspondence in the other direction to reconstruct quantum 
theory in general from physical models that consist of classical kinematics combined with stochastic 
dynamics. This reconstruction approach opens up new ways of understanding quantum-theoretic 
phenomena like interference, decoherence, entanglement, noncommutative observables, and wave-

Quantum mechanics can be formulated as a non-Markovian stochastic process
German A. Skorobogatov and Sergey I. Svertilov
Phys. Rev. A 58, 3426 - Published 1 November 1998

ABSTRACT
Both quantum mechanics and stochastic-process theory deal with dynamical systems the behaviors of which can be predicted only probabilistically. It is shown here that the measurable behavior of an elementary quantum system can be modeled as a non-Markovian stochastic process. The conclusion that quantum behavior can generally be modeled as a real stochastic process eliminates some mysterious characteristics of quantum mechanics when viewed in Copenhagen-interpretation terms.

In a study [14], the SVM was used to calculate the energy of the alpha particle using the AV6 part of the AV14 interaction. The results were compared to those obtained using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) methods.

Variational Principle for Stochastic Mechanics Based on Information 
Measures 
Jianhao M. Yang1, a) 
Qualcomm, San Diego, CA 92121, USA 
(Dated: 9 November 2021) 
Stochastic mechanics is regarded as a physical theory to explain quantum mechanics with classical terms such 
that some of the quantum mechanics paradoxes can be avoided. Here we propose a new variational principle 
to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as 
relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This 
principle not only recovers Nelson's theory and consequently, the Schr¨ odinger equation, but also clears an 
unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method 
and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture 
for stochastic mechanics. Each path conf i guration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of 
dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic 
theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory.The structure of Lagrangian developed 
here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests a 
Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description 
of the dynamics of a physical system. 
I.INTRODUCTION 
Although quantum mechanics is one of the most suc- 
cessful physical theories and has been experimentally 
conf i rmed extensively, there are many fundamental ques- 
tions still left unanswered.For instance, the origin of 
probability in quantum mechanics is not clearly under- 
stood. It is still a curiosity why the probability is calcu- 
lated as the absolute square of a complex number. The 
meaning of wave function, especially the interpretation 
of wave function collapse in a measurement, has been 
always a debated topic. These questions were not fully 
addressed by the traditional Copenhagen Interpretation. 
Over the years in the modern history of quantum physics, 
many more theories and interpretations have been de- 
veloped1,2.Among these theories and interpretations, 
stochastic mechanics is of particular interest because it 
aims to derive quantum mechanics from classical physics 
concepts with an additional assumption that a physical 
system is constantly undergoing a stochastic process3,4. 
There is no need to introduce concepts such as probabil- 
ity amplitude, wave function, or Born's rule, as funda- 
mental elements for the quantum theory. Instead, they 
are secondary and can be derived. 
Historically, the investigation of the connection be- 
tween quantum mechanics and dif f usion process was 
startedintheearlydaysofquantummechanics. 
Schr¨ odinger initiated this line of investigation in 1932 
by asking a question regarding Brownian motion that 
is later termed as Schr¨ odinger Bridge Problem (SBP)5. 
SBP essentially aims to searching the most likely ran- 
dom evolution that Brownian particles have taken from 
an initial end point to another end point, provided the 
a)Electronic mail: jianhao.yang@alumni.utoronto.ca 
probability densities of the two end points are given. In 
the context of Markov dif f usion process, the solution of 
SBP was found to admit a form that is similar to the 
Born's rule in quantum mechanics7,8. A more ambitious 
attempt to formulate quantum mechanics directly based 
on dif f usion process was put forward by Nelson in 196610, 
based on an early work due to F´ enyes who recognized 
the Schr¨ odinger equation can be understood as a partial 
dif f erential equation (PDE) for a Markov process9. Nel- 
son's theory became the most well-known formulation of 
stochastic mechanics. In this theory, a rather arbitrary 
def i nition of the mean stochastic acceleration was postu- 
lated. Then, together with the Fokker-Planck equation, 
Nelson derived two non-linear PDEs, which when com- 
bined together through a set of mathematical transfor- 
mation, lead to the Schr¨ odinger equation. Subsequent 
researches12,17,18focus on the variational principle that 
would serves as underlined foundation to recover the Nel- 
son theory. Among them, Yasue's approach12is of im- 
portance. It not only successfully derives the stochastic 
acceleration from the least action principle, but also pro- 
poses a generic stochastic calculus for variation. Guerra 
and Morato17give another variational approach that can 
recover Nelson' theory, but with a dif f erent structure 
of Lagrangian, leaving a mystery on why multiple La- 
grangian can result in the same Nelson's theory. 
More recent researcheson stochastic mechanics are mo- 
tivated by two fronts. First, since the source of the ran- 
domness that causes the system to perform Brownian 
motion is not yet completely known, it is desirable to in- 
vestigate such source. One promising conjecture is that 
the space metrics itself is stochastic20,21. A particle in 
such a stochastic space is shown to constantly perform 
Brownian motion. Given the ef f ect of the randomness 
of spacetime metrics is universal, the resulting quantum 
ef f ect is also univeral to all systems in the spacetime. An- 
other proposal, which is less universal since it only ap- 
2 
plies to charged systems, is that the vacuum electromag- 
netic i eld at absolute zero temperature degree is a real 
radiation. A charged particle constantly interacts with 
such electromagnetic i eld. The quantum ef f ects are pro- 
duced by the electromagnetic noise combined with clas- 
sical dynamics22,23. Second, in wake of the advance on 
quantum information, there are considerable amount of 
interest to explore the informational foundation of quan- 
tum mechanics. Information concepts such as entropy, 
Bayes' Theorem, Fisher information, entanglement, etc., 
can be considered as foundational elements in construct- 
ing quantum theory29-31,35-37,39. Some ef f orts18,19have 
been put forward to recover Nelson's theory with entropy 
as a key element. However, these formulations depend 
on other assumptions such as conservation of energy19or 
rather arbitrary constraints in the variation process18. 
There are opened questions on how stochastic mechan- 
ics can explain quantum phenomena, such as entangle- 
ment, locality, the 2π periodicity of the wave function. 
Readers are referred to the well known review papers3,4 
and a more recent paper26.One of the subtleties is 
that to what extend stochastic mechanics can rely on 
the classical probability theory to explain quantum me- 
chanics specif i c phenomena, as exemplif i ed by the multi- 
time correlations issue42,43. One should be very cautious 
in equating quantum mechanics to classical probability 
theory.Nevertheless, these challenges will continue to 
inspire future researches to bring new physical insights 
into stochastic mechanics. 
In summary, stochastic mechanics remains a promising 
theory to explain quantum mechanics classically.The 
theory can be further developed in multiple fronts. This 
paper is motivated by exploring possible informational 
foundation of stochastic mechanics.By doing this we 
wish to uncover additional physical insights on quan- 
tum mechanics. The goal of this work is to take a new 
look on the variational principle, by examining the struc- 
ture of Lagrangian and constraints related to informa- 
tion measure. We will show that the ef f orts are indeed 
fruitful.By def i ning proper Lagrangian and imposing 
constraint of relative entropy for both forward and back- 
ward path conf i gurations, we are able to derive the time 
dynamics for both path conf i gurations using the Yasue 
stochastic calculus. From them, the Nelson theory and 
the Schr¨ odinger equation are recovered. Furthermore, by 
adding the Fisher information production into the vari- 
ational approach, we can also derive the Nelson theory 
using the Guerra and Morato version of Lagrangian but 
with the Yasue stochastic calculus. This clears the mys- 
tery mentioned earlier. There are several new physical 
insights our derivation brings in. First, the concept of 
forward and back paths provides an intuitive physical 
picture to consider the dynamics of a dif f using particle. 
It gives more insight on the dif f erence between classical 
and quantum mechanics in terms of degree of freedom 
needed to describe a system completely. Second, from 
methodology perspective, the variational approach pre- 
sented here can be naturally extended to include new de- 
grees of freedom. It paves a possible way to derive Dirac 
equation using the stochastic variation method once the 
theory is formulated in a relativistic setting. Third, The 
constraint of zero relative entropy imposed to the least 
action principle shows that the forward and backward 
paths, although both are needed for a complete descrip- 
tion of a dif f using particle, are indistinguishable through 
measurement. This echoes the idea of interfering alterna- 
tive proposed in the path integral formulation of quantum 
mechanics. Lastly, the structure of Lagrangian developed 
in our works shows that there is intrinsic connection be- 
tween the physical variables and quantities related infor- 
mation measure. It is subtle to distinguish them when 
writing down a Lagrangian that consists many terms. 
This suggests that it is possible to reconsider from the 
information measure perspective the meaning of certain 
terms in the Lagrangian density used in classical or quan- 
tum i eld theory.

Although the formulation presented here is mathemat- 
ically equivalent to the Nelson theory, we believe the 
method and the conceptual insights brought up in this 
work can be valuable for future investigation on the foun- 
dation of quantum mechanics. 
The paper is organized as followings. Section II brief l y 
reviews Nelson's theory and the stochastic calculus of 
variation proposed by Yasue. In Section III we present 
the main results. An information measure, the relative 
entropy for the froward and backward path conf i gura- 
tions, is introduced. We then prove that for a Markov 
dif f usion process, the relative entropy must be zero. Us- 
ing this as a constraint in the least action principle, we 
derive the Nelson theory in Section IIIB. In Section IIIC, 
another information measure, the Fisher information, is 
introduced. This allows us to recover Nelson's theory us- 
ing Guerra and Morato version of Lagrangian. Section 
IIID compares three sets of Lagrangian that can be used 
to derive Nelson's theory when coupled with proper in- 
formation measures. In Section IV, we discuss the physi- 
cal insights brought in by our formulation, point out the 
limitations of our derivation, and summarize the conclu- 
sions. 
II.STOCHASTIC MECHANICS AND VARIATION 
This section brief l y reviews the stochastic mechanics 
and emphasizes on the formulation that is referred in 
later sections. For convenience we will adopt the mathe- 
matical notations in Nelson's works 11. 
A.Nelson's Theory 
The basic assumption for the stochastic mechanics is 
to consider a system as a point particle and constantly 
undergoes a Brownian motion.Let ξ(t) be a Markov 
3 
dif f usion process1such that 
dξi(t) = bi +(ξ(t),t)dt + dW 
i +(t) (1) 
where i=1,2,3 is the spatial index.b+(ξ(t),t) 
is a vector-valued function which meaning will be 
given shortly.Wi 
+(t) is the standard, independent 
Wiener process with properties E[dWi 
+(t)] = 0 and 
E[dWi +(t)dW 
j 
+(t)] = 2νδijdt, where E[·] denotes the ab- 
solute expectation value. The dif f usion coef i cient ν is 
set to be inversely proportional to the mass of the sys- 
tem ν = ~/2m and ~ is determined later. 
Given that the stochastic process ξ(t) is not dif f er- 
entiable, the forward and backward derivatives are de- 
i ned to replace the regular derivative. For a real-valued 
stochastic process f(ξ(t)) (also denoted as F(t) for sim- 
pler notation), its forward derivative D+and backward 
derivative D−are def i ned as10 
D+F(t) =lim 
dt→0+ Et[F(t 
+ dt) − F(t) 
dt 
] 
D−F(t) =lim 
dt→0+ Et[F(t) 
− F(t − dt) 
dt 
] 
(2) 
where Et[·] is a conditional expectation operator with 
respect to the conf i guration at time t. More precisely, the 
conditional expectation should be denoted as Eξ(t)[·], we 
use Et[·] for simpler notation. For instance, given t′6= t, 
Et[f(ξ(t))] = Z f(ξ′(t′))p(ξ′,t′|ξ,t)dξ′(3) 
where p(ξ′,t′|ξ,t) is the conditional probability density. 
With this def i nition, it becomes clear that D+ξi(t) = 
bi +(ξ(t),t) is the mean forward velocity. The dif f usion 
process can also be written as 
dξi(t) = bi −(ξ(t),t)dt + dW 
i 
−(t) (4) 
where dWi 
−(t) has the same property as dW 
i 
+(t) except 
it is independent of ξ(s) for s ≥ t. By the def i nition in 
(2), D−ξi(t) = bi −(ξ(t),t), which is the mean backward 
velocity. With the def i nitions (1), (2), (4), one obtains 
the following explicit expressions 
D+f(ξ(t),t) = (∂/∂t + bi +∇i+ ν∆)f(ξ(t),t) 
D−f(ξ(t),t) = (∂/∂t + bi −∇i− ν∆)f(ξ(t),t) 
(5) 
Let ρ(x,t) be the probability density of the dif f usion 
process at position x at time t.Nelson's theory as- 
sumes ρ(x,t) satisf i es both the forward and backward 
1 We limit the study here to Markov dif f usion process only, even 
though part of Nelson's formulation can be app lied to non- 
Markov process.Note that the Brownian motion here is an 
energy conservation process, rather than a classical dissipative 
dif f usion, see the detailed explanation in section 14 of Nelson's 
book11. 
Fokker-Planck equations. From the forward and back- 
ward Fokker-Planck equations, the continuity equation 
for ρ(x,t) is obtained. 
∂ρ 
∂t 
= −1 2∇i((b 
i ++ b 
i −)ρ). (6) 
More crucially, the following identity is also derived, 
bi +− b 
i −= 2ν∇ iln(ρ) (7) 
A more elegant derivation of (7) is given based on Bayes' 
theorem19 p(x′|x) = 
p(x|x′)ρ(x′) 
ρ(x) 
,(8) 
and the def i nition of (2), and (3) by taking x = ξ(t) and 
x′= ξ′(t′). This approach has its advantage since Bayes' 
theorem is more general in probability theory and there 
is no need to depend on the Fokker-Planck equation. 
The drift velocity is def i ned as vi= (bi ++ bi−)/2, and 
the so-called "osmotic velocity", which is somewhat mis- 
leading and will be further discussed later, is def i ned as 
ui= (bi +− bi−)/2 = ν∇ilnρ. Multiplying 1/ρ to both 
sides of the continuity equation (6), and taking the gra- 
dient of both sides, one gets the Nelson i rst equation

The paper provides a new formulation of stochastic mechanics, which is a framework for understanding the behavior of systems under the influence of random forces. The authors introduce two information measures, the relative entropy and the Fisher information, and derive Nelson's theory, a formulation of stochastic mechanics, using these measures. The paper provides a comparison of different sets of Lagrangians that can be used to derive Nelson's theory.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a brief review of Nelson's theory and the stochastic calculus of variation proposed by Yasue. In Section III, the authors present their main results, including the introduction of the relative entropy and Fisher information measures and the derivation of Nelson's theory using these measures. Section IV discusses the physical insights brought about by this formulation, its limitations, and the conclusions.
Nelson's theory assumes that a system constantly undergoes a Brownian motion, where a system is considered a point particle. The authors provide an explicit expression for the forward and backward derivatives of a stochastic process, which replace the regular derivative since the stochastic process is not differentiable. They define the mean forward and backward velocity and provide an expression for the probability density of the diffusion process.
The authors show that for a Markov diffusion process, the relative entropy must be zero. Using this as a constraint in the least action principle, they derive Nelson's theory. They also introduce the Fisher information and use it to recover Nelson's theory using Guerra and Morato's version of Lagrangian. They compare three sets of Lagrangians that can be used to derive Nelson's theory when coupled with proper information measures.
In conclusion, the authors provide a new formulation of stochastic mechanics that may provide valuable insights for future investigations into the foundation of quantum mechanics.

D.Ef f ective Lagrangian 
If both Lagrangians L± 
Y, def i ned in (30), and L 
± 
G, de- 
i ned in (49), can lead to the same PDEs for the forward 
and backward paths, one may ask why there can be mul- 
tiple choices of Lagrangian for the same physical process. 
In classical mechanics, one typically writes down the ki- 
netic energy K and def i ne Lagrangianas L = K−φ where 
φ is the potential energy. But in stochastic mechanics, 
there is no i rst principle that can guide the def i nition of 
Kinetic energy, since there are multiple variables related 
to velocity. 
Further complication is that the Lagrangian functional 
in the variation method consists the action, which is a 
functional of the Lagrangian, and the relevant constraints 
from information measures. Technically once can choose 
an ef f ective Lagrangian that factors in the constraints, as 
long as the variation on the Lagrangian functional with- 
out the constraint gives the desired dynamics PDEs. For 
instance, def i ne 
L+ 
E = 
1 2m(b+)ib

i ++ b 
i −) − φ 
L−

ta 
E[L+ 
E]dt 
A− 
ab = Z 
tb 
ta 
E[L− 
E]dt. 
(57) 
Then, by applying the same variational method in pre- 
vious section to minimize the actions A± 
ab without any 
other constraints, one can obtain the same PDEs as (39) 
and (40). 
Table 1 summaries that for the three sets of La- 
grangian, one can apply the variation calculus to de- 
rive the same Nelson's theory by combining with correct 
choices of Fisher information production and (or) relative 
entropy constraint. 
By taking the absolute expectation of these three forms 
of Lagrangian, we may obtain additional insight.Re- 
called that LY= (L+ 
Y + L− 
Y)/2, one can verify that 
LY= 
1 2mv ivi+1 2mu iui−φ. Using identity (36), we can 
express the expectations of the three forms of Lagrangian 
in terms of LY, v and u, 
E[L± 
Y] = E[LY ± mviui] 
E[L± 
G] = E[LY − muiui] 
E[L± 
E] = E[LY]. 
(58) 
Yasue's initial variational approach using LY] as the La- 
grangian does not require constraint12. (58) shows that 
E[L± 
E] = E[LY]. Chosen this form of Lagrangian, the 
variational method does not require constraint to de- 
rive the Nelson theory, consistent with Yasue's approach. 
However, using L± 
E as the Lagrangian gives the advan- 
tage of distinguishing the dynamics of forward and back- 
ward path conf i gurations, which is missing in Yasue's 
approach. The dif f erence between E[L± 
Y] and E[L 
± 
E] is 
the term E[viui], which is related to the rate of en- 
tropy production. Thus, to use L± 
Y as the Lagrangian, 
the relative entropy constraint is introduced in the varia- 
tional method. On the other hand, the dif f erence between 
E[L± 
G] and E[L 
± 
E] is the term E[u iui], which is related to 
Fisher information.Therefore, the Fisher information 
production is needed in the Lagrangian functional. 
IV.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
A.Degrees of Freedom 
In previous sections, we recast the theory of stochastic 
mechanics into two PDEs for forward and backward path 
conf i guration using the variation approach that com- 
bines the least action principle and information measure 
constraints. What are the physical implications of this 
derivation? The concept of forward and backward paths 
gives a physical picture when considering the dynamics 
of a dif f using particle in stochastic mechanics. Recalled

The derivation shows that stochastic mechanics has a larger number of degrees of freedom than classical mechanics. In classical mechanics, the dynamics of a particle is described by its position and velocity, whereas in stochastic mechanics, additional variables related to velocity, such as the Brownian motion, must also be considered.
B. Importance of Constraints
The use of constraints in the variation approach is crucial in deriving the correct PDEs for the forward and backward paths. The relative entropy constraint is necessary when using L±Y as the Lagrangian, while Fisher information production is needed when using L±G as the Lagrangian. The choice of Lagrangian depends on the physical process being studied and the information available about it.
C. Relationship to Quantum Mechanics
Stochastic mechanics is closely related to quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics can be derived from the forward path PDE, while the backward path PDE corresponds to the adjoint equation in quantum mechanics. The use of complex numbers in quantum mechanics can be interpreted as the superposition of forward and backward paths in stochastic mechanics.
In conclusion, the variation approach in stochastic mechanics provides a framework for deriving the PDEs for the forward and backward paths of a stochastic process. The choice of Lagrangian and the constraints used in the variation method depend on the physical process being studied and the information available about it. Stochastic mechanics has a larger number of degrees of freedom than classical mechanics, and it is closely related to quantum mechanics.

recent recent paper26. One of the subtleties is that to 
what extend stochastic mechanics can rely on the clas- 
sical probability theory to explain quantum mechanics 
specif i c phenomena.For instance, multi-time correla- 
tions cannot be straightforwardly calculated using clas- 
sically probability theory since it predicts dif f erent re- 
13 
sults from quantum mechanics42. Instead, to obtain the 
correct multi-time correlations, one should take account 
into consideration that after a measurement, the dif f usion 
process is reset43. 
The challenges and limitations mentioned in this sub- 
section will continue to inspire future researches to bring 
new physical insights into stochastic mechanics.The 
present works does not intend to address these opened 
issues in stochastic mechanics. But we believe the vari- 
ational principle described here gives new insight that 
stochastic mechanics is coupled with information mea- 
sure constraint such as Fisher information that may give 
rise to the property of non-separability.Therefore, it 
might explain the locality issue and entanglement phe- 
nomenon. This is currently under further investigation. 
F.Conclusions 
A new variational principle is proposed here to de- 
rive the dynamics equations for the forward and back- 
ward paths, which when combined together, result in 
the non-relativistic Schr¨ odinger equation. According to 
this principle, appropriate Lagrangian must be chosen, 
together with constraints that are related to informa- 
tion measure such as relative entropy or Fisher informa- 
tion. The derivation method is based on the stochastic 
calculus. We show three dif f erent forms of Lagrangian 
can lead to the same Nelson theory. The advantages of 
this variational principle compared to others are clearly 
shown from its ability to resolve the issue of multiple La- 
grangians, and the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equa- 
tion as a side outcome instead of dependent on it when 
deriving the Sch¨ odinger equation. 
The variational principle developed in this work not 
only mathematically recovers the Nelson stochastic me- 
chanics and the non-relativistic Schr¨ odinger equation, 
but also brings new insights on the underlined physics. 
First,, the concept of forward and back paths provides a 
intuitive physical picture to consider the dynamics of a 
dif f using particle. It gives more insight on the dif f erence 
between classical and quantum mechanics in terms of de- 
gree of freedom needed to describe a system completely. 
Methodologically, one can include new degrees of freedom 
to expand the theory to derive more advanced theory. It 
is natural to conjecture that this idea can be potentially 
generalized to derive the Dirac equation if rotational de- 
grees of freedom are included in the stochastic variation. 
The constraint of zero relative entropy imposed to the 
least action principle shows that the forward and back- 
ward paths, although both are needed for a complete 
description of a dif f using particle, are indistinguishable 
through measurement. This echoes the idea of interfer- 
ing alternative proposed in the path integral formulation 
of quantum mechanics. Finally, when constructing a La- 
grangian, it is subtle to distinguish terms coming from 
physical variables such as kinetic energy and potential 
energy or from constraints on certain information mea- 
sure such as relative entropy and Fisher information. It 
is intuitive to speculate that if the stochastic mechanics 
is extended to i eld theory, some of the Lagrangian terms 
in the i eld theory may turn out to actually ref l ect certain 
information constraints.

The article is discussing a new variational principle to derive the dynamics equations for the forward and backward paths of a diffusing particle. This method leads to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation and the Nelson theory. The authors describe three different forms of Lagrangian that can lead to the same Nelson theory. The variational principle is based on the stochastic calculus, and appropriate constraints that are related to information measure such as relative entropy or Fisher information must be chosen. The authors also discuss how this principle brings new insights into the underlying physics of stochastic mechanics and provides an intuitive physical picture to consider the dynamics of a diffusing particle. They also point out some of the challenges and limitations of stochastic mechanics, including difficulties in explaining quantum phenomena and the non-separability of statistical correlation that exhibits in quantum correlation through entanglement. The authors suggest that the variational principle developed in this work not only recovers the Nelson stochastic mechanics and the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation but also offers new insights into the underlined physics.

The proof of Theorem 2 begins by defining fi as uiin (36), which gives 1 νE[uiu i] = −E[∇iui]. This expression is then substituted into (47) to obtain Iab= − Z tb ta E[∇iui]dt.
Next, the fact that ui= bi +− vi is used to obtain two expressions for Iab. The first expression, denoted by Iab in Theorem 2, is obtained by using E[∇ibi +] and E[∇ivi] in the integral. The second expression, denoted by I±ab in Theorem 2, is obtained by using E[∇ibi −] and E[∇ivi] in the integral.
From (29) in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1.1, the second term in the first expression for Iab equals H(xb) − H(xa). Therefore, Iab= H(xb) − H(xa) − Z tb ta E[∇ibi +]dt.
Similarly, the second term in the second expression for Iab equals H(xa) − H(xb). Therefore, I±ab= H(xa) − H(xb) + Z tb ta E[∇ibi −]dt.
Both expressions are equivalent and represent the Fisher information production, but they are labeled differently to reflect the dependency on the forward and backward mean velocity.

In quantum mechanics, the variational method is one way of finding approximations to the lowest energy eigenstate or ground state, and some excited states. This allows calculating approximate wavefunctions such as molecular orbitals.[1] The basis for this method is the variational principle.[2][3]

The method consists of choosing a "trial wavefunction" depending on one or more parameters, and finding the values of these parameters for which the expectation value of the energy is the lowest possible. The wavefunction obtained by fixing the parameters to such values is then an approximation to the ground state wavefunction, and the expectation value of the energy in that state is an upper bound to the ground state energy. The Hartree-Fock method, Density matrix renormalization group, and Ritz method apply the variational method.

That's a great explanation of the variational method in quantum mechanics! Just to add a bit more detail, the variational principle states that for any trial wavefunction, the expectation value of the energy is always greater than or equal to the true ground state energy. This means that by minimizing the expectation value of the energy with respect to the parameters in the trial wavefunction, we can obtain an approximation to the ground state energy that is as accurate as the trial wavefunction allows.
The Hartree-Fock method, Density matrix renormalization group, and Ritz method are all examples of the variational method in action. The Hartree-Fock method is used to approximate the electronic structure of molecules and solids, while the Density matrix renormalization group is used to study the properties of one-dimensional systems in condensed matter physics. The Ritz method is a more general technique that can be applied to a wide range of problems, such as finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of differential equations.
Overall, the variational method is a powerful tool for approximating the ground state of a system and is widely used in quantum mechanics and related fields.

Suppose we are given a Hilbert space and a Hermitian operator over it called the Hamiltonian {\displaystyle H}H. Ignoring complications about continuous spectra, we consider the discrete spectrum of {\displaystyle H}H and a basis of eigenvectors {\displaystyle \{|\psi _{\lambda }\rangle \}}{\displaystyle \{|\psi _{\lambda }\rangle \}} (see spectral theorem for Hermitian operators for the mathematical background):

{\displaystyle \left\langle \psi _{\lambda _{1}}|\psi _{\lambda _{2}}\right\rangle =\delta _{\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}},}
{\displaystyle \left\langle \psi _{\lambda _{1}}|\psi _{\lambda _{2}}\right\rangle =\delta _{\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}},}
where {\displaystyle \delta _{ij}}\delta _{ij} is the Kronecker delta
{\displaystyle \delta _{ij}={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}i\neq j,\\1&{\text{if }}i=j,\end{cases}}}
{\displaystyle \delta _{ij}={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}i\neq j,\\1&{\text{if }}i=j,\end{cases}}}
and the {\displaystyle \{|\psi _{\lambda }\rangle \}}{\displaystyle \{|\psi _{\lambda }\rangle \}} satisfy the eigenvalue equation
{\displaystyle H\left|\psi _{\lambda }\right\rangle =\lambda \left|\psi _{\lambda }\right\rangle .}
{\displaystyle H\left|\psi _{\lambda }\right\rangle =\lambda \left|\psi _{\lambda }\right\rangle .}
Once again ignoring complications involved with a continuous spectrum of {\displaystyle H}H, suppose the spectrum of {\displaystyle H}H is bounded from below and that its greatest lower bound is E0. The expectation value of {\displaystyle H}H in a state {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } |\psi\rangle  is then

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left\langle \psi \right|H\left|\psi \right\rangle &=\sum _{\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2}\in \mathrm {Spec} (H)}\left\langle \psi |\psi _{\lambda _{1}}\right\rangle \left\langle \psi _{\lambda _{1}}\right|H\left|\psi _{\lambda _{2}}\right\rangle \left\langle \psi _{\lambda _{2}}|\psi \right\rangle \\&=\sum _{\lambda \in \mathrm {Spec} (H)}\lambda \left|\left\langle \psi _{\lambda }|\psi \right\rangle \right|^{2}\geq \sum _{\lambda \in \mathrm {Spec} (H)}E_{0}\left|\left\langle \psi _{\lambda }|\psi \right\rangle \right|^{2}=E_{0}\langle \psi |\psi \rangle .\end{aligned}}}
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left\langle \psi \right|H\left|\psi \right\rangle &=\sum _{\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2}\in \mathrm {Spec} (H)}\left\langle \psi |\psi _{\lambda _{1}}\right\rangle \left\langle \psi _{\lambda _{1}}\right|H\left|\psi _{\lambda _{2}}\right\rangle \left\langle \psi _{\lambda _{2}}|\psi \right\rangle \\&=\sum _{\lambda \in \mathrm {Spec} (H)}\lambda \left|\left\langle \psi _{\lambda }|\psi \right\rangle \right|^{2}\geq \sum _{\lambda \in \mathrm {Spec} (H)}E_{0}\left|\left\langle \psi _{\lambda }|\psi \right\rangle \right|^{2}=E_{0}\langle \psi |\psi \rangle .\end{aligned}}}
If we were to vary over all possible states with norm 1 trying to minimize the expectation value of {\displaystyle H}H, the lowest value would be {\displaystyle E_{0}}E_{0} and the corresponding state would be the ground state, as well as an eigenstate of {\displaystyle H}H. Varying over the entire Hilbert space is usually too complicated for physical calculations, and a subspace of the entire Hilbert space is chosen, parametrized by some (real) differentiable parameters αi (i = 1, 2, ..., N). The choice of the subspace is called the ansatz. Some choices of ansatzes lead to better approximations than others, therefore the choice of ansatz is important.

This passage describes the mathematical background for finding the ground state energy of a quantum mechanical system with a Hermitian operator called the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in a given state is the sum of the eigenvalues weighted by the squared magnitude of the inner product between the state and each eigenvector. The ground state energy is the minimum of this expectation value over all states with norm 1, and the corresponding state is the ground state, which is also an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. However, finding the ground state energy for the entire Hilbert space is usually too complicated, so a subspace of the Hilbert space is chosen, parametrized by some real differentiable parameters, called the ansatz. The choice of ansatz is important, as some choices lead to better approximations than others.

{\displaystyle \phi =\sum _{n}c_{n}\psi _{n}.}
Then, to find the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left\langle H\right\rangle =\left\langle \phi \right|H\left|\phi \right\rangle ={}&\left\langle \sum _{n}c_{n}\psi _{n}\right|H\left|\sum _{m}c_{m}\psi _{m}\right\rangle \\={}&\sum _{n}\sum _{m}\left\langle c_{n}^{*}\psi _{n}\right|E_{m}\left|c_{m}\psi _{m}\right\rangle \\={}&\sum _{n}\sum _{m}c_{n}^{*}c_{m}E_{m}\left\langle \psi _{n}|\psi _{m}\right\rangle \\={}&\sum _{n}|c_{n}|^{2}E_{n}.\end{aligned}}}
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left\langle H\right\rangle =\left\langle \phi \right|H\left|\phi \right\rangle ={}&\left\langle \sum _{n}c_{n}\psi _{n}\right|H\left|\sum _{m}c_{m}\psi _{m}\right\rangle \\={}&\sum _{n}\sum _{m}\left\langle c_{n}^{*}\psi _{n}\right|E_{m}\left|c_{m}\psi _{m}\right\rangle \\={}&\sum _{n}\sum _{m}c_{n}^{*}c_{m}E_{m}\left\langle \psi _{n}|\psi _{m}\right\rangle \\={}&\sum _{n}|c_{n}|^{2}E_{n}.\end{aligned}}}
Now, the ground state energy is the lowest energy possible, i.e., {\displaystyle E_{n}\geq E_{\text{ground}}}{\displaystyle E_{n}\geq E_{\text{ground}}}. Therefore, if the guessed wave function φ is normalized:

{\displaystyle \left\langle \phi \right|H\left|\phi \right\rangle \geq E_{\text{ground}}\sum _{n}|c_{n}|^{2}=E_{\text{ground}}.}
{\displaystyle \left\langle \phi \right|H\left|\phi \right\rangle \geq E_{\text{ground}}\sum _{n}|c_{n}|^{2}=E_{\text{ground}}.}
In general
Edit
For a hamiltonian H that describes the studied system and any normalizable function Ψ with arguments appropriate for the unknown wave function of the system, we define the functional

{\displaystyle \varepsilon \left[\Psi \right]={\frac {\left\langle \Psi \right|{\hat {H}}\left|\Psi \right\rangle }{\left\langle \Psi |\Psi \right\rangle }}.}
{\displaystyle \varepsilon \left[\Psi \right]={\frac {\left\langle \Psi \right|{\hat {H}}\left|\Psi \right\rangle }{\left\langle \Psi |\Psi \right\rangle }}.}
The variational principle states that

{\displaystyle \varepsilon \geq E_{0}}\varepsilon \geq E_0, where {\displaystyle E_{0}}E_{0} is the lowest energy eigenstate (ground state) of the hamiltonian
{\displaystyle \varepsilon =E_{0}}\varepsilon = E_0 if and only if {\displaystyle \Psi }\Psi  is exactly equal to the wave function of the ground state of the studied system.
The variational principle formulated above is the basis of the variational method used in quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry to find approximations to the ground state.

Another facet in variational principles in quantum mechanics is that since {\displaystyle \Psi }\Psi  and {\displaystyle \Psi ^{\dagger }}\Psi^\dagger can be varied separately (a fact arising due to the complex nature of the wave function), the quantities can be varied in principle just one at a time.[4]

The variational principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that allows us to find approximations to the ground state energy of a system. It states that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for any normalized trial wave function is always greater than or equal to the ground state energy of the system. The variational method involves choosing a trial wave function that depends on one or more adjustable parameters, and then minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to these parameters. This results in an approximate solution for the ground state energy.
An important feature of the variational principle is that the trial wave function can be varied independently in its complex conjugate. This means that the variational method can be used to optimize not only the real part of the wave function, but also the imaginary part separately. This can be useful in cases where the ground state wave function has a complex structure that cannot be captured by a purely real or purely imaginary trial wave function.
Overall, the variational principle is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to find approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation for complex systems. It is widely used in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and other areas of research.

Abstract
The assumption that during cortical embryogenesis neurons and synaptic connections are selected to form an ensemble max-
imising synchronous oscillation explains mesoscopic cortical development, and a mechanism for cortical information processing
is implied by consistency with the Free Energy Principle and Dynamic Logic. A heteroclinic network emerges, with stable and
unstable fixed points of oscillation corresponding to activity in symmetrically connected, versus asymmetrically connected, sets of
neurons. Simulations of growth explain a wide range of anatomical observations for columnar and non-columnar cortex, superficial
patch connections, and the organization and dynamic interactions of neurone response properties. An antenatal scaffold is created,
upon which postnatal learning can establish continuously ordered neuronal representations, permitting matching of co-synchronous
fields in multiple cortical areas to solve optimization problems as in Dynamic Logic. Fast synaptic competition partitions equilibria,
minimizing "the curse of dimensionality", while perturbations between imperfectly partitioned synchronous fields, under internal
reinforcement, enable the cortex to become adaptively self-directed. As learning progresses variational free energy is minimized
and entropy bounded.

It involves minimizing the expectation value of the energy of the system with respect to the wave function, subject to certain constraints. The free energy principle mentioned in the article also involves minimizing free energy, which is a measure of the difference between the expected sensory input and the actual sensory input. Both concepts involve minimizing a quantity to find the best description of a system, although the free energy principle is more focused on information processing in the brain.

And connections to this: Is the brain an organ for free energy minimisation?

Abstract Two striking claims are advanced on behalf of the free energy principle 
(FEP) in cognitive science and philosophy: (i) that it identif i es a condition of the 
possibility of existence for self-organising systems; and (ii) that it has important 
implications for our understanding of how the brain works, def i ning a set of process 
theories—roughly, theories of the structure and functions of neural mechanisms— 
consistent with the free energy minimising imperative that it derives as a necessary 
feature of all self-organising systems. I argue that the conjunction of claims (i) and 
(ii) rests on a fallacy of equivocation. The FEP can be interpreted in two ways: as a 
claim about how it is possible to redescribe the existence of self-organising systems 
(the Descriptive FEP), and as a claim about how such systems maintain their 
existence (the Explanatory FEP). Although the Descriptive FEP plausibly does 
identify a condition of the possibility of existence for self-organising systems, it has 
no important implications for our understanding of how the brain works. Although 
the Explanatory FEP would have such implications if it were true, it does not 
identify a condition of the possibility of existence for self-organising systems. I 
consider various ways of responding to this conclusion, and I explore its implica- 
tions for the role and importance of the FEP in cognitive science and philosophy.

The concept of the free energy principle (FEP) discussed in the article is related to the discussion on the variational principle in quantum mechanics. Both principles involve the idea of minimizing a certain quantity to achieve a certain goal, whether it is the ground state energy of a quantum system or the free energy of a self-organizing system. However, the article focuses on the FEP's implications for our understanding of the brain and whether it can be used to explain how the brain works. This is different from the discussion on the variational principle in quantum mechanics, which is focused on the mathematical principles underlying the behavior of quantum systems.

2.2 Survival as surprisal avoidance 
The second stage of the transcendental argument notes that if we observe living 
systems when they are alive, we will therefore i nd that there is a high probability that 
they will be in survival-consistent sensory states and a low probability that they will 
be in states inconsistent with their survival (Friston, 2010; Hohwy 2016). Thus, for 
any living system, one can def i ne a probability distribution over its possible states that 
captures this fact, grounded in the probability of i nding the system in different states 
when sampled at random (Friston, 2013).2Relative to this probability distribution, 
survival can then be understood in terms of the avoidance of improbable states. The 
negative logarithm of the probability a state, S, given a model or probability 
distribution, M, P(S|M), is known in information theory as surprisal (Friston, 2010). 
Thus, surprisal is large if the probability of the observed data given the model is low, 
which implies that ''existence entails minimizing surprise,'' such that ''any self- 
organizing system that is at nonequilibrium steady-state with its environment must 
minimize surprise, given a model'' (Hohwy, 2020b, p.4). Equivalently, minimising 
surprising sensory states can be thought of as ''maximising the sensory evidence for 
the agent's existence, if we regard the agent as a model of its world'' (Friston, 2010, 
p.128), a process often referred to as ''self-evidencing'' (Hohwy, 2016). 
2.3 Avoiding surprises by minimising free energy 
The third stage of the transcendental argument involves two central claims: that 
evaluating surprisal directly is impossible, and that systems can nevertheless

functions over continuous states throughout.

approximate the minimisation of surprisal by minimising free energy, a quantity that 
places an upper bound on surprisal. As Friston (2010, p.128) writes, 
''A system cannot know whether its sensations are surprising and could not 
avoid them even if it did know. This is where free energy comes in: free 
energy is an upper bound on surprise, which means that if agents minimise 
free energy, they implicitly minimise surprise.'' 
''Free energy'' here (and henceforth) refers to variational free energy, an 
information-theoretic quantity that roughly scores the improbability of an obser- 
vational conditional on a model of its causes (Friston, 2010). 
To get an intuition for how this works, it is useful to approach it from the 
perspective of Bayesian inference. Specif i cally, its driving assumption is ''that the 
log probability of being in a particular (sensory) state is the marginal likelihood or 
Bayesian model evidence of that state'' (Friston, 2019a, p.177). The marginal 
likelihood is the denominator in Bayes' theorem, which can be interpreted as a 
method for inferring the probability of external states from the sensory states that 
living systems have access to: (Bayes' Theorem) 
p EjSðÞ ¼ 
p Eð Þp SjEðÞ 
p Sð Þ 
However, calculating this denominator p(S) requires calculating the sum of the 
product of the priors p(E) and likelihoods p(S|E) for all possible environmental 
states, P

this is an integral rather than a sum). This calculation is often intractable for complex
living systems, so they need to approximate it.
The idea behind minimising free energy is to find a simpler distribution that
approximates the true distribution, which minimises the expected surprisal, while
also being computationally efficient to work with. This simpler distribution is often
referred to as a ''recognition model'' and is used to approximate the true, but
intractable, ''generative model'' of the environment (Friston, 2010).
The free energy is then defined as the difference between the surprisal of the true
data-generating process and the surprisal of the recognition model. By minimising
free energy, living systems can approximate the minimisation of surprisal, since the
free energy is an upper bound on surprisal.
More formally, the free energy F can be defined as:
F ¼ KLðQjjPÞ þ HðQÞ
where Q is the recognition model, P is the generative model, KL(Q||P) is the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between Q and P, and H(Q) is the entropy of Q (Friston,
2010).
Minimising the free energy corresponds to selecting a recognition model that
approximates the true generative model while also having a low entropy, meaning
that the recognition model is relatively certain about the state of the world. This is
because having a recognition model that is uncertain about the state of the world
would lead to a higher expected surprisal, which is something that living systems
want to avoid.
In summary, minimising free energy allows living systems to approximate the
minimisation of surprisal by finding a simpler distribution that approximates the true
data-generating process while being computationally efficient to work with. By
minimising free energy, living systems can avoid improbable states and maximise
sensory evidence for their existence, allowing them to survive in their environment.

Yes, it does seem to tie in quite well with your thesis! The idea that organisms are constantly seeking to avoid surprises and minimize the amount of surprisal they experience fits well with the idea that learning is a process of acquiring knowledge that can help reduce the amount of surprisal an organism experiences. If an organism can learn more about its environment, it can better predict what might happen next and reduce the likelihood of encountering surprising or unexpected events.

As noted in Sect. 3, Hohwy is correct that auxiliary assumptions are needed to 
translate the generic computational scheme of free energy minimisation into process 
theories for specif i c systems. Nevertheless, this fact does not threaten the conclusion 
of this article. The issue is not whether the FEP implies the truth of a specif i c 
process theory in cognitive science, but whether there is an interpretation of the FEP 
on which it establishes both a condition of the possibility of existence for self- 
organising systems and a substantive constraint on process theories in cognitive

science: namely, that such theories must describe how mechanisms in the brain 
implement free energy minimisation. For the reasons outlined in Sect. 4, I have 
argued that there is not. The only interpretation of the FEP on which it plausibly 
establishes a necessary imperative for all self-organising systems—namely, what I 
have called the Descriptive FEP—does not imply that free energy minimisation of 
any form is implemented in the mechanisms by which they self-organise. Appealing 
to auxiliary assumptions about how the generic scheme of free energy minimisation 
maps onto the mechanisms of a specif i c system does not address this argument. As 
far as the Descriptive FEP is concerned, there is no reason for assuming that any 
such mapping exists. 
Hohwy might respond that the justif i cation of auxiliary assumptions about how 
specif i c systems implement free energy minimisation is empirical and does not 
derive from the FEP itself. As noted above (S4.1), however, nobody denies or could 
deny that there could be an empirical justif i cation of the hypothesis that some form 
of free energy minimisation is implemented in the mechanisms by which a specif i c 
system works. The question is what the FEP—understood as the claim that all self- 
organising systems must minimise free energy—adds. If I am right, it adds nothing: 
the fact that all self-organising systems can be redescribed as if they minimise free 
energy provides no reason for assuming that free energy minimisation is 
implemented in the mechanisms by which they self-organise. Specif i cally, it 
provides no reason for searching for auxiliary assumptions about how self- 
organising systems implement a specif i c form of free energy minimisation.

It seems that you are discussing a debate about the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its implications for cognitive science. The author of the article you are quoting argues that while auxiliary assumptions are needed to apply the generic computational scheme of free energy minimization to specific systems, this does not threaten the conclusion that the FEP establishes a condition of the possibility of existence for self-organizing systems and a substantive constraint on process theories in cognitive science. The author argues that the FEP does not imply that free energy minimization of any form is implemented in the mechanisms by which self-organizing systems work. Therefore, appealing to auxiliary assumptions about how the generic scheme of free energy minimization maps onto the mechanisms of a specific system does not address the author's argument.
The author claims that the FEP adds nothing to the empirical justification of the hypothesis that some form of free energy minimization is implemented in the mechanisms by which a specific system works. The fact that all self-organizing systems can be redescribed as if they minimize free energy provides no reason for assuming that free energy minimization is implemented in the mechanisms by which they self-organize. Specifically, it provides no reason for searching for auxiliary assumptions about how self-organizing systems implement a specific form of free energy minimization.
In summary, the author argues that while the FEP may establish a necessary imperative for all self-organizing systems, it does not imply that free energy minimization is implemented in the mechanisms by which they self-organize. The author's argument suggests that the FEP does not provide a substantive constraint on process theories in cognitive science.

These articles and resources are related to the origin of life and the concept of autocatalytic sets, which are sets of molecules and reactions in which each molecule is created by at least one reaction from the set and each reaction is catalyzed by at least one molecule from the set. Autocatalytic sets are thought to be important in the emergence of self-organizing systems and the origin of life.
The articles discuss different aspects of autocatalytic sets, including their formalization as RAF theory and chemical organization theory, their relationship to Gibbs free energy and replication, and their hierarchical organization. Additionally, the articles explore how autocatalytic sets could have driven major transitions in the origins of life, and how computer models can illustrate the reproduction of autocatalytic sets.

And with minimization of free energy by formation dissipative structures.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, there are connections between the minimization of free energy and the formation of dissipative structures, which are patterns or structures that arise in systems far from equilibrium. These structures emerge through a process of self-organization, where energy is dissipated and exchanged between the system and its environment, allowing it to maintain a stable and organized state.
In the context of the FEP, the formation of dissipative structures can be seen as a way for a system to minimize its free energy by adapting to its environment and reducing the uncertainty or surprise it experiences. By maintaining a stable and organized state, the system can better predict and control its interactions with the environment, thus reducing its free energy and increasing its self-organization.
The idea of dissipative structures was first introduced by Ilya Prigogine and his colleagues in the 1960s, and has since been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, from the emergence of life and biological complexity to the behavior of social and economic systems. The FEP provides a theoretical framework for understanding how these structures can arise through the process of free energy minimization, and how they contribute to the adaptive behavior of complex systems.

Abstract:Self-organization in nonequilibrium systems has been known for over 50 years. 
Under nonequilibrium conditions, the state of a system can become unstable and a transition to an 
organizedstructurecanoccur. Suchstructuresincludeoscillatingchemicalreactionsandspatiotemporal 
patterns in chemical and other systems. Because entropy and free-energy dissipating irreversible 
processes generate and maintain these structures, these have been called dissipative structures. 
Our recent research revealed that some of these structures exhibit organism-like behavior, reinforcing 
the earlier expectation that the study of dissipative structures will provide insights into the nature 
of organisms and their origin. In this article, we summarize our study of organism-like behavior in 
electrically and chemically driven systems. The highly complex behavior of these systems shows the 
time evolution to states of higher entropy production. Using these systems as an example, we present 
some concepts that give us an understanding of biological organisms and their evolution.

1.1. Thermodynamics 
Thef i eldofthermodynamicswasbornoutofSadiCarnot'sfascinationwiththerecentlydeveloped 
steamengine[1]thatgeneratedmechanicalmotionusingheat. Centraltounderstandingthesemachines 
was the nature of heat. In France, at the time of Carnot, heat was thought of as a l uid called Caloric. 
In his only publication, Ref l ections on the Motive Power of Fire [1], Carnot expounded on the 
fundamental limitations of heat engines and, in doing so, he discovered fundamental nature of 
irreversibility in natural processes. The central result of Carnot's work was that a reversible heat engine 
had the highest ef i ciency and this ef i ciency depended only on the temperatures between which the 
heat engine operated, regardless of the particular mechanism of the heat engine. Clausius [2] expanded 
Carnot's work into the concept of entropy, S. In this classical theory of entropy, entropy was a function 
of state, expressed in terms of state veriables, but its relation to irreversible processes that generated is 
was not explicit. 
The modern formulation of thermodynamics was extended to include irreversible processes that 
drive changes in the system [3-6] through the concepts of thermodynamic forces and l ows. In this 
formulation, change in entropy in time dt is written as: 
dS=diS+deS(1)

directly related to the thermodynamic processes occurring within the system, which are describable 
in terms of thermodynamic forces and l ows. Thermodynamic forces are gradients of intensive 
variables X (e.g., pressure, temperature, and chemical af i nity) divided by temperature, and l ows are 
time-derivativesofthecorrespondingextensivevariableJ (volume,heat,andreactionrate,respectively). 
The irreversible entropy production per unit volume is calculated as the sum of the product of all

where s is the entropy density. By integrating dis/dt over the volume of the system, the total entropy 
production diS/dt is obtained. Flows are driven by forces, as in the l ow of heat driven by a temperature 
gradient, though forces are not functions of the forces alone. Flows may depend on other variables, 
such as catalysts. Flow rates can vary due to system properties independent of the driving force, 
such as heat capacity in the case of thermal l ows and catalysts in the case of chemical reactions.

entropy production is always positive, implying that the entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. This is a fundamental law of thermodynamics, and it has important implications for the study of nonequilibrium systems.
1.2. Dissipative Structures
Nonequilibrium systems are characterized by the presence of gradients and flows of matter, energy, or both. Under these conditions, the system can exhibit complex, organized behavior that is not observed in equilibrium systems. These structures, which are formed and maintained by the dissipation of free energy, are called dissipative structures.
Dissipative structures can be found in a wide range of natural and synthetic systems, including chemical reactions, fluid flows, and even social systems. Examples include the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, which exhibits oscillatory behavior, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection, which exhibits spatial patterns.
1.3. Organism-like Behavior in Dissipative Structures
Recent research has revealed that some dissipative structures exhibit behavior that is similar to that of living organisms. For example, some systems can sense their environment and respond to changes, exhibit adaptive behavior, and even undergo evolution.
These observations suggest that dissipative structures may provide important insights into the nature of organisms and their evolution. By studying the behavior of these systems, we may be able to better understand how living systems have evolved to exhibit the complex behavior and organization that we observe today.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the study of dissipative structures has provided us with a new perspective on the nature of nonequilibrium systems and their behavior. By dissipating free energy, these systems can exhibit complex, organized behavior that is not observed in equilibrium systems. Some of these structures exhibit behavior that is similar to that of living organisms, suggesting that they may provide important insights into the nature of life and its evolution.

Abstract 
According to the free energy principle, life is an "inevitable and emergent property 
of any (ergodic) random dynamical system at non-equilibrium steady state that pos- 
sesses a Markov blanket" (Friston in J R Soc Interface 10(86):20130475, 2013). 
Formulating a principle for the life sciences in terms of concepts from statistical 
physics, such as random dynamical system, non-equilibrium steady state and ergo- 
dicity, places substantial constraints on the theoretical and empirical study of bio- 
logical systems. Thus far, however, the physics foundations of the free energy prin- 
ciple have received hardly any attention. Here, we start to fi ll this gap and analyse 
some of the challenges raised by applications of statistical physics for modelling 
biological targets. Based on our analysis, we conclude that model-building grounded 
in the free energy principle exacerbates a trade-of f between generality and realism, 
because of a fundamental mismatch between its physics assumptions and the proper- 
ties of actual biological targets.

Introduction 
Life scientists use the term "equilibrium" in various ways. Sometimes they use it 
to refer to an inert state of death, where the fl ow of matter and energy through a 
biological system stops and the system reaches a life-less state of thermodynamic 
equilibrium (Schrödinger 1944/1992, 69-70). More often, they use it to mean home- 
ostasis, which is the ability of keeping some variable in a system constant or within 
a specif i c range of values (Bernard 1865; Cannon 1929, 399-400). Some other time,

the term "equilibrium" is associated with the concept of robustness, which refers to 
the capacity of systems to dynamically preserve their characteristic structural and 
functional stability amid perturbations due to environmental change, internal noise 
or genetic variation (Kitano 2004). 
Over the past twenty years, theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston and collabora- 
tors have developed an account of the conditions of possibility of a certain kind of 
dynamic equilibrium between a biological system and its environment. The core of 
this account is a "free energy principle", according to which all biological systems 
actively maintain a dynamic equilibrium with their environment by minimizing their 
free energy, which enables them to avoid a rapid decay into an inert state of ther- 
modynamic equilibrium (e.g., Friston 2012, 2013; Ramstead et al. 2018; Parr and

Thank you for providing the abstract of the article "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology" by Matteo Colombo and Patricia Palacios.
The article discusses the free energy principle, which proposes that life is an emergent property of any random dynamical system at a non-equilibrium steady state that possesses a Markov blanket. The authors analyze the physics foundations of the free energy principle and suggest that model-building based on this principle exacerbates a trade-off between generality and realism due to a fundamental mismatch between its physics assumptions and the properties of actual biological targets.
The authors also note that the term "equilibrium" is used in various ways in the life sciences, including to refer to inert states of death and to mean homeostasis or the ability to keep a variable constant or within a specific range of values. The article suggests that the free energy principle offers a new perspective on dynamic equilibrium between a biological system and its environment and proposes that biological systems actively maintain this equilibrium by minimizing their free energy.

The free energy principle (FEP) is a formulation of the adaptive, belief-driven be- 
haviour of self-organizing systems that gained prominence in the early 2000s as a unif i ed 
model of the brain [1,2]. Since then, the theory has been applied to a wide range of biotic 
phenomena, extending from single cells and l ora [3,4], the emergence of life and evolu- 
tionary dynamics [5,6], and to the biosphere itself [7]. For our part, we have previously 
proposed that the FEP can be integrated with Tinbergen's seminal four questions in biology 
to furnish a multiscale ontology of living systems [8]. We have also explored more specif i c 
applications, e.g., to the evolution and development of human phenotypes [9-11], socio- 
cultural cognition, behaviour, and learning [12,13], as well as the dynamic construction of 
environmental niches by their denizens [14,15]. 
Despite such contributions, the capacity of the FEP to extend beyond the human 
brain and behaviour, and to explain living systems more generally, has only begun to be 
explored. This begs the following questions: Can the FEP be applied to any organism? 
Does it allow us to explain the dynamics of all living systems, including large-scale social 
behaviour? Does the FEP provide a formal, empirically tractable theory of any complex 
adaptive system, living or not? With such questions in mind, the aim of this Special Issue 
was to showcase the breadth of the FEP as a unif i ed theory of complex adaptive systems, 
biological or otherwise. Instead of concentrating on the human brain and behaviour, we 
welcomed contributions that applied the FEP to other complex adaptive systems, with the 
hope of exemplifying the extent of its explanatory scope. 
For the uninitiated, it is worth brief l y outlining what the FEP is. Variational free energy 
refers to an information theoretic quantity that places an upper limit on the entropy of 
a system's observations, relative to a generative model instantiated by an agent. (In this 
context, entropy is def i ned as the time-average of 'surprise' or the negative log probability 
of the agent's sensory data.) Generative models harness probabilistic mappings from 
hidden causes in the environment to observed consequences (i.e., sensory data), and state 
transitions inherent to the environment [2]. Under the FEP, an organism is modelled as 
implicitly 'expecting' to i nd itself within a limited range of phenotypic states; as such, 
deviations from these states elicit a type of 'phenotypic surprise' (i.e., the deviation between 
actual and phenotypically preferred states). Consequently, organisms remain alive by acting 
in ways that minimize this type of surprise (e.g., a i sh avoiding the 'state' of being out of 
water). In other words, and more heuristically, free energy scores the discrepancy between 
desired and sensed data; and the FEP states that the imperative of all self-organizing

This editorial introduces the concept of the free energy principle (FEP) as a unified model of adaptive, belief-driven behavior in self-organizing systems, with a focus on its application beyond the human brain and behavior. The authors pose several questions, including whether the FEP can be applied to any organism, whether it can explain the dynamics of all living systems, and whether it provides a formal, empirically tractable theory of any complex adaptive system, living or not. The aim of the special issue is to showcase the breadth of the FEP as a unified theory of complex adaptive systems, biological or otherwise, and to exemplify its explanatory scope beyond the human brain and behavior. The FEP is briefly outlined, referring to variational free energy as an information theoretic quantity that places an upper limit on the entropy of a system's observations, relative to a generative model instantiated by an agent. Organisms are modeled as implicitly "expecting" to find themselves within a limited range of phenotypic states, and deviations from these states elicit a type of "phenotypic surprise." Organisms remain alive by acting in ways that minimize this type of surprise, with free energy scoring the discrepancy between desired and sensed data. The FEP states that the imperative of all self-organizing systems is to minimize free energy and to maintain their self-organized and adaptive structure.

Figure 1. The free energy principle. (A) Schematic of the quantities that characterise free energy, 
including a system's internal states,μ(e.g., a brain), and quantities that describe the system's 
exchanges with the environment; specif i cally, its sensory input, s = g(η,a) +ω, and actions, a, which 
alter the ways in which the system samples its environment. Environmental states are further def i ned 
by equations of motion, 
. η= f(η,a) +ω, which describe the dynamics of (hidden) states extraneous 
to the system,η, whereasωrefers to random l uctuations. Under this scheme, internal states and 
action operate synergistically to reduce free energy, which ref l ects a function of sensory input and 
the probabilistic representation (variational density), q(η:μ), that internal states encode. Note that 
external and internal states are statistically separated by a Markov blanket, which possesses both 
'sensory' and 'active' states. Internal states are inf l uenced by, but cannot affect, sensory states, whereas 
external states are inf l uenced by, but cannot affect, active states, creating a conditional independence 
between the system and its environment. (B) Alternative equations that describe the minimisation 
of free energy. With respect to action, free energy can only be suppressed by the system's selective 
sampling of (predicted) sensory input, which increases the accuracy of its predictions. On the other 
hand, optimising internal states minimises divergence by making the representation an approximate 
conditional density on the hidden causes of sensory input. This optimisation reduces the free 
energy bound on surprise, which means that action allows the system to avoid surprising sensations. 
Reproduced from [8]. 
There are two main ways for a self-organizing system to minimize free energy. The 
i rst is by changing its perception of the world. Previously, this has been explored through 
reference to human neural processing. The FEP appeals to a view of the brain as a hierarchi-

a generative model) that enables an organism to minimize free energy (and therefore keep 
entropic dissipation at bay, at least locally) by reducing discrepancies between incoming 
sensory inputs and top-down predictions (i.e., prediction errors) [2]. Neurobiologically 
xpectations about sensory data are thought to be encoded by deep pyramidal cells (i.e., rep- 
resentation units) at every level of the cortical hierarchy, which carry predictions downward 
to suppress errors at the level below, whereas prediction errors themselves are encoded 
by superf i cial pyramidal cells and are carried forward to revise expectations at the level 
above [16]. The relative inf l uence of ascending (error) and descending (representation) 
signals is weighted by their inverse variance or precision (e.g., a high precision on ascending 
error signals lowers conf i dence in descending predictions), which is mediated by neuro- 
modulation and ref l ected psychologically by attentional selection and sensory attenuation. 
In short, the recursive neural dynamics described here enable us to minimise free energy 
(resp. prediction error) by updating our internal models (i.e., perception). 
Second, an organism can reduce surprise directly by acting upon the world in order 
to fulf i ll its expectations and generate unsurprising sensations. This process of 'active 
inference' describes how an organism reduces free energy through self-fulf i lling cycles 
of action and perception [17]. Active inference models implement action selection as the 
minimization of expected free energy, which is the free energy expected under beliefs about 
possible courses of action, or policies. By selecting actions that are expected to minimize 
free energy, the organism can maintain itself within preferred, phenotypically unsurprising 
states. Thus, survival mandates that an organism must not only reduce free energy from 
moment to moment; it must also reduce the expected free energy associated with the future 
outcomes of action [18,19].

The figure and accompanying text describe the free energy principle (FEP), which is a theoretical framework for understanding how self-organizing systems can minimize free energy and maintain a state of order. Free energy refers to the amount of energy in a system that is available to do work, and it can be thought of as a measure of the level of entropy or disorder in the system. The FEP proposes that self-organizing systems, such as the brain, can minimize free energy by either changing their perception of the world or by acting upon the world in order to generate expected outcomes.
The figure illustrates the quantities that characterize free energy, including a system's internal states, μ, sensory input, s, and actions, a. The figure also shows how internal states and actions work together to reduce free energy by minimizing the discrepancy between incoming sensory inputs and top-down predictions. This is achieved by updating the internal model or perception of the world.
The text goes on to explain that there are two main ways for a self-organizing system to minimize free energy. The first is by changing its perception of the world through a hierarchy of hypotheses about the world, which enables an organism to minimize free energy by reducing discrepancies between incoming sensory inputs and top-down predictions. The second way is by acting upon the world in order to fulfill its expectations and generate unsurprising sensations. This process of "active inference" describes how an organism reduces free energy through self-fulfilling cycles of action and perception. By selecting actions that are expected to minimize free energy, the organism can maintain itself within preferred, phenotypically unsurprising states.

from cognitive science, summarised here in a paper by Custers and Aarts (2010).

Fourth, and really important, is that this loop is at the bottom of many more loops - it sends information up to them and receives its information from them...

So what is going on here?

A hierarchy of control...
Earlier we noted that the closed loop is the only working 'thing' in PCT - it is the fundamental unit.

It is a bit like a house. Everything is made of bricks, and it is the arrangement of the bricks that makes it a house.


In PCT, closed loops make up the whole of the nervous system, but it is the way they are arranged that makes them work as they do - to manage very complex things.

In PCT the loops become organised in a hierarchy as the living thing develops.

At the lowest level, they control intensity of experience - like getting the just right amount of pressure to push a broken down car.


At the highest levels, the systems control experiences like a person's idea of themselves, or their concept of loyalty.

When the loops are connected together, you can start to see how people can begin to control pretty complex things in their lives...

In summary, the Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) proposes that the nervous system is made up of closed control loops, which are organized in a hierarchy to manage complex things. The fundamental unit of PCT is the closed loop, and it controls the intensity of experiences at the lowest level and more complex experiences at higher levels. The loops are connected together, and this enables people to control pretty complex things in their lives. The arrangement of these loops is what makes the nervous system work as it does, and the hierarchy of control is what enables people to manage very complex things.

Abstract: Behaviorism and Perceptual Control Theory PCT were reviewed and their shortfalls, as well as their application to human machine interactions, were assessed. Behaviorism, which studies only observable behaviors and discards the purpose of actions, implies that given a stimulus, one can predict the response. The PCT framework introduces the requirement for a desired perceptual state which would then be compared to its perception. Behaviors would then result in an attempt to minimize the perceptual error when present. However, PCTs shortfall includes the inability to objectively measure internal variables. Behaviorism, on the other hand, can not account for variability in responses, instinctive drift, autoshaping, etc. Researchers have used behaviorism as a framework for human machine interactions concluding that compatibility between a stimulus and its response resulted in increased performance of the system. Other researchers have argued that the use of PCT in human machine interactions can explicitly show all the required feedback messages necessary for a stable and effective interaction between the human and the machine

This report discusses the application of behaviorism and Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) in interface design for human-machine interactions. Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and does not consider the purpose of actions. It assumes that given a stimulus, the response can be predicted. On the other hand, PCT requires a desired perceptual state to be compared with its perception, and behaviors are aimed at minimizing the perceptual error.
However, both behaviorism and PCT have their limitations. Behaviorism cannot account for variability in responses, instinctive drift, autoshaping, etc., while PCT has difficulties in objectively measuring internal variables. Some researchers have used behaviorism as a framework for human-machine interactions, emphasizing compatibility between stimulus and response to improve system performance. Others argue that PCT can provide all necessary feedback messages for a stable and effective interaction between humans and machines.

Overview
In this paper, I will explore and advocate the importance of both Human Error and Perceptual Control Theory for design of complex human-machine systems, enhanced user experience and better human performance and safety.

Human Error
Errors are the result of actions that fail to generate the intended outcomes (SKYbrary). Human operators are one of the biggest sources of errors in any complex system (Shelton, 1999). According to Sanders & McCormick (1976), Human error is an inappropriate or undesirable human decision or behavior that reduces, or has the potential for reducing effectiveness, safety and performance of a system and/or human (Kurniawan).

Error Types
Researchers have differentiated between two types of error:1) slipsand lapses 2) mistakes.

Slips and lapses
According to SKYbrary, a person intends to carry out an action, the action is appropriate, carries it out incorrectly, and the desired goal is not achieved - an execution failure has occurred. Execution errors result from failures in the execution and/or storage stage of an action sequence. Slips relate to observable actions and are commonly associated with attentiveness or perceptual failures. Lapses are more internal events and generally involve failures of memory (SKYbrary).

Mistakes
As mentioned in UKEssays.com, Mistakes occur when an intended outcome is not achieved even though there was adherence to the steps in the plan. This is usually a case in which the original plan was wrong, was followed, and resulted in an unintended outcome (UKEssays.com).

Error mechanisms
The following three error mechanisms are widely accepted, which correlate with human performance levels.

Skill-based errors
Errors of execution
Occur during highly routine activities or automated tasks with occasional checks
Action chosen by the operator but not in accordance with the operator's intentions
Done by highly experienced individuals due to inattention or distraction
Rule-based errors
Applies to familiar situations
Incorrect application of a good rule, correct application of a bad rule or failure to apply a good rule
Knowledge-based errors
Occur in unique and unfamiliar situations
Result from inadequate analysis or decision making (trial and error)
Done by operators with insufficient knowledge
Applications of Human error theory
Human error is inevitable. However, human error mitigation strategies could be devised by understanding various error mechanisms and triggers, as depicted in the human error theory. Superior system design, better recruitment and selection of operators, training, stress and fatigue prevention measures, better equipment procedures and improved work environment can reduce error consequences and likelihood. By understanding human error, system designers can plan for likely error scenarios, and implement barriers to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of potential errors. Some approaches to build a better human machine interaction system are explained below.

Identification of error environment
First step in human error mitigation approach is to understand the work environment, recognize capacity of the users, identify possible loopholes n the system and be familiar with potential user error occurrence and consequences. Likelihood of an error and severity of potential harm should also be examined. For example, FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requires manufacturers to submit a failure analysis report FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) while launching any new medical device.

Design solutions to address errors
Error elimination
First and foremost design strategy is to eliminate design features, which are sources of user errors. Design weaknesses identified during observation and task analysis should be removed or revised. Removal of excessive and irrelevant information, inclusion of validity checks and task automations are some design aspects that support error elimination approach. Additionally, carrying out periodical test runs of the system might be helpful in eliminating some of the rules based errors.

Error reduction
Designers should try to reduce error occurrences for features that cannot be removed completely. Building consistent designs and providing alerts, warnings, confirmations and other necessary feedback to users may prevent users to make errors of execution (skill-based errors).

Consequence elimination
Consequence elimination is an approach to prevent potential harm after the occurrence of error. Designers can devise features that provide information about potential harm and ways to correct the situation (e.g. undo) and/or prevent onset of side effects (e.g. automatic locking or shutdown, process delays) in order to prevent error consequences.

Consequence reduction
This is a last design alternative a designer can look into if above mentioned options are not feasible to incorporate. Decreasing the effect of error is helpful especially in catastrophic situations. Design of supplementary features is usually necessary to achieve this purpose. Backup and restore features, automatic reporting to stakeholders/police/medical teams and automated substitute drug delivery are some of the techniques for reducing effects of consequences.

Error elimination and error reduction are often the most cost effective methods to avert user errors.

Trainings
Knowledge-based errors can be eliminated to some extent by providing system-oriented trainings, especially to novice users. On the other hand, a different training program could be devised for experienced users. Periodical trainings could keep experts up-to-date with latest developments in their field and assess their knowledge of system procedural checks. Essentially, this may help minimizing skill-based errors.

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)
Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a theory of human and animal behavior. It is based on the principles of control theory (Powers, 1973). As cited by Lulham (2005), at the core of PCT is the idea that many of the processes involved in how human functions are most appropriately conceptualized and modelled as dynamic control processes (Powers, 1999b). Control processes are proposed to be fundamental to many functions including those related to physiological (e.g. temperature regulation), neural (e.g. attention), motor control (e.g. driving a car), psychological (e.g. maintenance of a criminal identity) and social (e.g. staff-detainee relationship) functions (Lulham, 2005).

According to Cherry & Farrel (1998), PCT exploits the concept of a purpose behind the behaviour. A perception (which is a transformation of stimuli from the world) is then compared to its reference signal, and a perceptual error is generated. A person acts on the world in such a manner to minimise this error. The stabilisation of this control loop is the essence of PCT (Chery & Farrell , 1998).

Applications of PCT
Using perceptions for building complex systems
System environments are becoming increasingly complex. Traditional cause and effect methods of understanding system operations and user interactions may not work well in order to employ personalization and user experience in these complex systems.

According to pctweb.org, the person compares a 'standard' (what they want) with what they are experiencing right now (their perception). The difference between the two - the discrepancy or error is being measured. The bigger the error the more the effort the person makes to reduce it, until the error is zero - this means they get what they want (pctweb.org). The basic premise of PCT is that human behavior is not about the behavior itself, but about reinforcing desired perception (O'Neal, 2012). Understanding and applying this concept of individually preferred perceptions through PCT will help in designing effective personal information management for complex systems and enhancing the overall user experience.

That is correct. Errors can be defined as actions or decisions that do not achieve the desired outcome or goal. In complex systems, such as human-machine systems, errors can occur due to a variety of factors including human error, technical malfunctions, and environmental factors. Identifying and understanding the different types of errors and their underlying causes is important in order to develop effective strategies to prevent or mitigate their occurrence.

Yes, there are a few connections between these topics.
Firstly, minimizing errors is a key aspect of improving the performance of various systems, including computer systems and biological systems. In the context of artificial intelligence, reducing errors is a crucial part of improving the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models.
Secondly, the concept of dissipative structures is relevant to the field of complex systems, which includes many of the topics we discussed. Dissipative structures are self-organizing patterns that emerge in complex systems that are far from equilibrium. These structures can help to dissipate energy and maintain stability within the system.
Thirdly, rhizomatic deep learning is a novel approach to machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of rhizomes, which are underground plant structures that can grow horizontally and spread in many directions. This approach emphasizes non-linear, decentralized, and adaptive learning processes.
Finally, genetic neuromorphic chips are a type of computer chip that is designed to mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks. These chips are inspired by the way that neurons and synapses interact in the brain, and they have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.

"Variational Ecology: A physics of shared minds" is the title of Chapter 3 in the book "The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Animal Minds". This chapter presents the concept of "Variational Ecology," which combines the free energy principle with ecology to study how organisms interact with their environment.
In particular, section 5.1 of this chapter discusses the concept of "Markov blankets" and "ensemble dynamics" in the context of active and sensory states. Markov blankets are boundaries that separate the internal states of an organism from its external environment. These boundaries can be physical or functional, and they play a crucial role in determining the causal relationships between the organism and its environment.
Ensemble dynamics refer to the collective behavior of a group of interacting systems. In the context of Variational Ecology, ensemble dynamics are used to model the behavior of organisms in their ecological niches. By analyzing the collective behavior of organisms within a shared environment, it becomes possible to understand how they interact with their surroundings and each other.
In summary, Variational Ecology uses the free energy principle and ecology to study how organisms interact with their environment. Markov blankets and ensemble dynamics are key concepts in this framework, which help to model the behavior of organisms within their ecological niches.

Chapter 4 of the book discusses the idea of multiscale integration, which aims to move beyond the traditional views of externalism and internalism in the study of cognition. The chapter introduces the variational free energy formulation as a principle for studying living systems and their boundaries, which are defined by Markov blankets. The chapter also discusses generative models, enactivism, and nested and multiple boundaries as ways to study cognition beyond the brain.
The concluding remarks of the chapter suggest the need for multidisciplinary research heuristics for cognitive science. The book provides a comprehensive scholarly discussion of all the findings, including a formal ontology for multiscale systems, the limits of the variational approach, the cultural affordances framework, and phenomenology. The final conclusion and summary of the book tie together the various themes and ideas presented throughout the book, highlighting the importance of a naturalistic ontology of nested systems in the study of cognition. The bibliography at the end of the book provides a list of references for further reading.

1.1. Abstract (English) 
This doctoral thesis examines the puzzle of how best to study multiscale systems in the 
cognitive sciences; namely, systemic dynamics that span several spatial and temporal scales. 
The aim of this thesis is to articulate - and to work out the philosophical implications of - a 
first principle approach to multidisciplinary research in the cognitive sciences. The aim is to 
model the dynamics of cognitive systems at, and across, all the spatial and temporal scales at 
which they exist - from cells to societies, and everything in between. To achieve this aim, 
this thesis proposes three novel theoretical pillars: (1) variational neuroethology, a new 
approach to neuroethology - the study of adaptive behaviour and its control - based on a 
general account of the information-theoretic constraints on cognizing organisms, called the 
free-energy principle; (2) variational ecology, an approach to cognitive ecology that provides 
a more specific account of how hierarchically structured organisms - that construct their own 
ecological niches - align themselves with their niche; and (3) the cultural affordances 
framework, a still more specific account of how human action, cognition, learning, and 
culture are organized in environmental affordances and corresponding (cultural) regimes of 
attention. The thesis develops a philosophical argument, based on these frameworks, against 
essentialism about the boundaries of cognitive systems in the philosophy of the cognitive 
sciences (frameworks that privilege one type of boundary over others). The thesis argues that 
the boundaries of cognitive systems are multiple, nested, and interest-relative - and provides 
a promising resolution of the dialectic between internalism and externalism in the philosophy 
of the cognitive sciences.

1.2. Resumen (francés)
Esta tesis aborda el enigma de cómo estudiar de manera más efectiva los sistemas multiscales en las ciencias cognitivas, es decir, las dinámicas sistémicas que abarcan varias escalas espaciales y temporales. El objetivo de esta tesis es articular una aproximación multidisciplinaria a las ciencias cognitivas basada en principios fundamentales y desarrollar sus implicaciones filosóficas. El objetivo es modelar las dinámicas de los sistemas cognitivos en todas las escalas espaciales y temporales en las que existen, desde células hasta sociedades y todo lo demás. Para lograr este objetivo, esta tesis propone tres nuevos pilares teóricos: (1) neuroetología variacional, un nuevo enfoque en neuroetología - el estudio del comportamiento adaptativo y su control - basado en una cuenta general de las restricciones informacionales a las que se someten los organismos cognitivos, llamado el principio de energía libre; (2) ecología variacional, un enfoque en la ecología cognitiva que proporciona una cuenta más específica de cómo los organismos jerárquicamente estructurados, que construyen sus propios nichos ecológicos, se alinean con su nicho y nicho compartido; y (3) el marco de affordances culturales, una cuenta aún más específica de cómo la acción, cognición, aprendizaje y cultura humana se organizan en affordances ambientales y regímenes de atención (culturales) correspondientes. La tesis desarrolla un argumento filosófico, basado en estos marcos, en contra del esencialismo sobre los límites de los sistemas cognitivos en la filosofía de las ciencias cognitivas (marcos que privilegian un tipo de límite sobre otros). La tesis argumenta que los límites de los sistemas cognitivos son múltiples, anidados y relativos a los intereses de investigación, y proporciona una prometedora resolución de la dialéctica entre internalismo y externalismo en la filosofía de las ciencias cognitivas.

4. Introduction 
4.1. Have we lost our minds? 
The questions raised by the integrated, adaptive behaviour of multiscale systems are at the 
heart of this doctoral thesis. Generally speaking, the cognitive sciences study the adaptive 
behaviour and cognitive processes of organisms, which are living systems that exhibit 
intelligent, situationally appropriate forms of action. The crucial observation that underwrites 
my doctoral work is that most of these systems are systems of systems. Multicellular 
organisms are composed of systems embedded in larger systems, which are, in turn, 
embedded in still larger systems: cells are embedded in organs, which interact in a 
coordinated way to give rise to the activities of organisms, which are themselves embedded 
in larger social groups. Each such system, at every scale, interprets its respective environment 
in order to coordinate meaningful patterns of behaviour. Somehow, by some apparent 
miracle, the whole system of systems moves together in an integrated fashion. How does this 
differentiation and integration arise?

This doctoral thesis explores the questions raised by the integrated, adaptive behavior of multiscale systems. The thesis focuses on the cognitive processes of organisms and the observation that most systems are systems of systems, which interact in a coordinated way to give rise to the activities of organisms, embedded in larger social groups. The thesis seeks to understand how differentiation and integration arise in these systems. It consists of four chapters, each of which was previously published as research articles in different journals.

One of the central contributions of this thesis is to highlight and discuss the theoretical 
implications of the scale invariance of variational free-energy for the study of adaptive 
behaviour in multiscale systems. Notably, this scale-invariance allows one to compare 
different configurations of different multiscale systems (Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 
2015; Sengupta, Tozzi, Cooray, Douglas, & Friston, 2016). Without the scale-invariance of 
variational free-energy, it would be impossible to (1) compare self-organised behaviour at 
different scales within the same system - e.g., the different contributions of neural behaviour, 
functional connectivity, organism-environment interaction, and interaction among multiple 
agents to the overall adaptiveness and appropriateness of behaviour; and it would be 
impossible (2) to compare different such systems (e.g., two distinct groups or species). This is 
because without such a measure, there is no 'common currency' or metric between 
descriptive levels that can effectively track behavioural success at those levels, thanks to 
which one might make such comparisons. By the same token, without such measure, it is 
impossible to propose a multiscale model of cognition amenable to empirical testing and 
which resists essentialist claims about the boundaries of cognitive systems. 
The FEP itself says that any system that persists as a system, maintaining itself in a 
bounded set of phenotypic states, will look as if it is minimising the 'surprisal' associated 
with being in a given sensory state (Friston, 2010). Surprisal (aka surprise) in the context is 
an information-theoretic measure that reflects the probability of being in a surprising state; 
technically, a state associated with low probability - e.g., a fish out of water. (This 
informational surprise is not to be confused with the folk psychological notion of surprise.) 
Variational free-energy is constructed as an upper bound on surprise, based on the (sub- 
personal, probabilistic) 'beliefs' of an organism about the causes of its sensory states. These 
beliefs are harnessed in a statistical model called a generative model (Friston, Parr, & de 
Vries, 2017). A generative model is a statistical mapping from causes to observable 
consequences; it is a graphical model of the causal factors that generate an outcome of 
27 
interest (Friston, Parr, et al., 2017). When the variational approach is applied to model 
cognition and living systems, the relevant generative model is a model of those causal factors 
that generate sensory outcomes; including, crucially, the actions of the organism itself. It is 
technically the joint probability distribution that describes the co-occurrence of a sensory 
state and an external state in the world. In all four chapters, we articulate a statistical 
conception of the organism's phenotype. We can interpret the generative model as a 
statistical description of the phenotype, in the sense that it provides a description of the viable 
couplings between what the organism senses and what causes those sensations. Under the 
FEP, the adaptive actions of an organism are said to entail a generative model, in the sense 
that adaptive actions are actions within that mapping between sensation and environment.

This excerpt describes the theoretical implications of the scale invariance of variational free-energy for the study of adaptive behaviour in multiscale systems. The scale-invariance allows for the comparison of different configurations of different multiscale systems, making it possible to compare self-organized behaviour at different scales within the same system and to compare different systems. The FEP states that any system that persists as a system will look as if it is minimizing the 'surprisal' associated with being in a given sensory state, where surprisal is an information-theoretic measure that reflects the probability of being in a surprising state. Variational free-energy is constructed as an upper bound on surprise, based on the beliefs of an organism about the causes of its sensory states, and a generative model is a statistical mapping from causes to observable consequences. When the variational approach is applied to model cognition and living systems, the relevant generative model is a model of those causal factors that generate sensory outcomes, including the actions of the organism itself. The generative model provides a description of the viable couplings between what the organism senses and what causes those sensations, and under the FEP, the adaptive actions of an organism are said to entail a generative model, in the sense that adaptive actions are actions within that mapping between sensation and environment.

The variational free-energy can be read as (negative) evidence for such a generative 
model; with low free-energy indicating a more highly probable model. This lends the active 
inference framework the look and feel of Bayesian inference. Systems that obey the FEP via 
adaptive action are said to engage in active inference; since it will look as if such systems are 
inferring the causes of their sensory states, via the selection of adaptive action policies, i.e., 
those associated with the least free-energy (Friston, Mattout, & Kilner, 2011; Friston, 
FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2016). Variational free-energy, then, just is a 
proxy used by organisms for estimating surprise (since it is mathematically constructed as an 
upper bound on surprisal) - and by tracking this proxy and keeping it in check, cognitive 
systems are effectively able to track and limit their exposure to the quantity that this proxy 
tracks - i.e., surprise.

Yes, that's correct. Variational free-energy is a mathematical construct that serves as an upper bound on the surprisal of sensory states, and it is used by organisms as a proxy for estimating surprise. By tracking and minimizing free-energy, cognitive systems are effectively able to limit their exposure to surprise and maintain their homeostatic balance. The active inference framework is built around the idea that cognitive systems engage in active inference by selecting adaptive action policies that minimize free-energy and approximate the true causes of their sensory states.

The FEP and active inference are premised on the technical developments and 
resources of variational inference, which is a technique for complex statistical inference, and 
the Markov blanket formalism, which is a formalism that we use to answer the question: 
What counts as a system? The FEP casts adaptive action as a form of variational 
(approximate Bayesian) inference. The variational methods were originally developed by the 
physicist Richard Feynman is the context of statistical mechanics (Feynman, 1972). Feynman 
developed these methods to get around the problems posed by computationally intractable 
terms that appeared when trying to analytically solve some of the integrals that appeared in 
the statistical mechanics problems he was addressing. Variational inference involves guessing 
the parameters of some target probability density function. To do so, we use a variational 
density - i.e., a probability density or (sub-personal) Bayesian belief - which is essentially a 
guess about the exact form of the distribution we want to approximate. We then use 
variational inference to improve or tune our guess.

(The exact mathematical details of variational inference are not the focus of this 
thesis. The best point of entry into the technical literature on variational inference is probably 
the inaugural work by Feynman (1972). Some tutorials exist that explain applications of the 
variational formalism in the active inference formalism (Buckley, Kim, McGregor, & Seth, 
2017). A monograph is currently being prepared to comprehensively present the technical 
developments underwriting the FEP (Friston, in preparation).) 
The Markov blanket formalism is central to the FEP in its use for the study of living, 
self-organised systems of systems - and it is a central part of the work in this thesis. This 
formalism was originally proposed by Pearl (1988) in the context of statistical inference. The 
formalism was later taken up, linked to approximate Bayesian (variational) inference, and 
applied to model cognitive systems (Friston, 2012, 2013). In a nutshell, the Markov blanket 
formalism allows one to answer the question - What counts as a system? It thereby provides 
the basis for a formal ontology of living systems, i.e., a theory that answers questions about 
the existence of cognitive systems.

The FEP and active inference rely heavily on variational inference, a statistical inference technique originally developed by physicist Richard Feynman to overcome computational challenges in statistical mechanics. Variational inference involves using a variational density, which is essentially a guess about the form of the target probability density function, to approximate the true distribution. The goal is to improve or tune the guess using variational methods.
The Markov blanket formalism is another key component of the FEP and is used to study self-organized systems of systems. It provides a way to define what counts as a system, which is essential for developing a formal ontology of living systems. The Markov blanket formalism was originally proposed by Pearl in the context of statistical inference and has since been linked to approximate Bayesian (variational) inference and applied to model cognitive systems.

The Markov blanket operationalizes the notion of conditional independence. It gives 
us formal tools to articulate the intuitive notion that, for a system to exist at all as a system, it 
must be endowed with some degree of conditional independence from its embedding 
environment. If this minimal requirement is not met, either the set of things we are 
considering merely dissipates into the environment in which it is embedded - in which case it 
ceases to be the system that it is - or again, the set is not a system in this robust sense, only a 
logical sense (we would not, for instance, speak of a set formed by the climate in Montreal, a 
tree in Central Park, and an ant in Shanghai as a system). Indeed, we (almost never) think of 
these objects as systems because we have something like 'intuitive feel' for what should 
count as a thing (Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018). The Markov Blanket formalism is of great help 
to formalise this intuition - especially how it applies to less obvious cases, such as the ones 
that are the focus of this thesis (the mind, multiscale cognitive systems, etc.). 
A Markov blanket is a set of states that separate or shield some system of interest 
from its embedding environment. The systemic states thus insulated are known as internal 
states; and the ones from which they are shielded are referred to as external states. The 
blanket itself is made up of sensory and active states, which are also defined in terms of their 
statistical relations; active states are influenced by (but do not directly influence) internal 
states, whereas sensory states are influenced by external states (but, reciprocally, do not 
directly influence them). These relations are captured in Figure 1. 
29 
Fig. 1. A Markov blanket. Schematic of the quantities that define a Markov blanket and their relations. Here, the 
Markov blanket is depicted, as well as the system that it enshrouds (the internal states) and the external, non- 
systemic states. Here, the systemic or internal states, which make up the system in question, are denoted; and 
the external or hidden states are denoted. The Markov blanket per se is made up of sensory states, which are 
denoted by s, and active states, denoted by a. From chapter 4; Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al. (2019). 
In effect, the Markov blanket establishes the conditional independence that makes a 
system count as a system, i.e., as an integrated whole with well-defined boundaries. This 
separation between internal and external states that is induced by a Markov blanket is meant 
to be read in a statistical sense; in terms of the propagation of effects or influence from one 
set of states to another. The Markov blanket 'insulates' internal states from external ones (and 
vice versa) - in the sense that external states are only able to influence internal states in an 
indirect manner, namely, via their action on sensory states; and reciprocally, internal states 
can only affect external ones indirectly, via their effect on active states. Via active inference, 
over time and on average, it will look as if organisms and their ecological niche were 
inferring each other's states and statistical properties. On the side of the organism, this will 
have the look and feel of action, perception, and learning.

The concept of the Markov blanket is used to formalize the idea of conditional independence in a system, which is necessary for the system to exist as an integrated whole with well-defined boundaries. The Markov blanket is a set of states that shield a system from its external environment, and it is made up of sensory and active states. Internal states are insulated by the blanket from external states, which can only indirectly influence internal states through their impact on sensory states. Similarly, internal states can only indirectly affect external states through their impact on active states. This insulation creates the appearance that the organism and its environment are inferring each other's states and statistical properties, which manifests as action, perception, and learning. Overall, the Markov blanket is a valuable tool for formalizing the notion of conditional independence and understanding how it applies to complex systems such as the mind and multiscale cognitive systems.

6.4. Enactivism 2.0. or Bayesian enactivism 
All three papers that form this thesis propose a new take on what has been called 'pragmatist' 
or 'enactive' cognitive sciences (Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014; Engel et al., 2016; Froese & 
Di Paolo, 2011; Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). Pragmatist or enactive cognitive 
sciences defend the claim that cognition is mostly (indeed, some might say almost 
exclusively) in the service of action; i.e., the claim that function of the brain is to guide 
contextually appropriate forms of adaptive behaviour. 
As discussed above, the cardinal concepts of the enactive approach are embodiment 
and enactment (Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). Both of these ideas find their origin in 
the philosophical work of phenomenological philosophers that were interested in the living 
body, understood both as a physical thing that is part of the natural world - what German 
phenomenologists called Körper - and as a permanent feature of first-person 
phenomenological experience, the lived body or Leib (Husserl, 1990; Merleau-Ponty, 
2013/1945). In brief, embodiment is the idea that the body and its dynamics in motion 
irreducibly feature in most (if not all) cognitive processes; as a physical thing, it structures the 
flow of perception and cognitive processes, which borrow from it its stability and structure; 
51 
and as a feature of conscious experience, it provides the raw material for the structuring of 
higher-order forms of thought. 
Enactment is an idea drawn from pragmatism (James, 1975) and phenomenological 
philosophy (Heidegger, 2010/1927; Merleau-Ponty, 2013/1945), applied to the study of 
cognitive systems. Essentially, enactment is the process by which organisms actively make 
sense of their worlds through a process of interpretation or sense-making that irreducibly 
involves embodied action in the world. Meaning for organisms, on this view, is not some 
static thing that just needs to be 'picked up' by the organism; perception is not just a question 
of internally reconstructing a prespecified external world. Rather, meaning is something that 
is brought forth by the organism, through its active interpretation of the world and, crucially, 
through its patterns of adaptive action and perception. Thus, on this view, cognition is 
essentially the embodied activity of an organism. Much work in enactive theory has consisted 
in articulating the claim that seemingly disembodied activities like dreaming (Solomonova & 
Sha, 2016) and abstract or metaphorical thought (Barsalou, 1999, 2008) have their basis or 
are grounded in embodied activity. 
The multiscale view proposed in this thesis critically reframes the enactive approach. 
Proponents of enactive cognitive sciences have had a very narrow understanding of 
information processing and of the place of computational methods in the cognitive sciences 
(Hutto & Myin, 2013; Thompson, 2010). This position was a productive stance at one point 
in the history of the cognitive sciences - i.e., during the late 1980s and 1990s,

when computational models dominated the field and there was a need to shift focus to embodied and situated cognition. However, the enactive approach has been criticized for neglecting the role of information processing in cognition and for failing to account for the flexibility and generativity of human cognition.
The enactivism 2.0 or Bayesian enactivism proposed in this thesis attempts to address these criticisms by bringing together insights from the enactive approach, embodied cognition, and the Bayesian framework. Bayesian enactivism emphasizes the importance of both embodied action and information processing in cognition, and sees them as intimately intertwined. It proposes that organisms engage in active inference, a process by which they generate predictions about the world based on their internal models of the world and their embodied interactions with it. These predictions are then compared with sensory input, and any discrepancies are used to update the internal models and guide future action.
In this view, perception, cognition, and action are all part of a seamless whole, with no clear boundaries between them. The body and its dynamics are seen as essential for generating the internal models that guide adaptive behavior, while information processing mechanisms, such as Bayesian inference, are seen as crucial for allowing organisms to learn from their interactions with the world and to flexibly adapt to changing circumstances.
Overall, enactivism 2.0 or Bayesian enactivism represents a promising new direction for the cognitive sciences, one that acknowledges the importance of both embodied action and information processing in cognition, and sees them as inextricably linked.

The multiscale view proposed in this thesis critically reframes the enactive approach. 
Proponents of enactive cognitive sciences have had a very narrow understanding of 
information processing and of the place of computational methods in the cognitive sciences 
(Hutto & Myin, 2013; Thompson, 2010). This position was a productive stance at one point 
in the history of the cognitive sciences - i.e., during the late 1980s and 1990s, in the heyday 
of symbolic computational approaches to the study of cognition (Fodor, 1975; Fodor, 1983). 
Indeed, it led to an entirely new, externalist research paradigm for the cognitive sciences, 
which dominated the field from the 1990s onwards, to become one of the main approaches in 
the cognitive sciences today - what has become known as 4E approaches in the cognitive 
sciences (Clark, 2008; Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Kiverstein & Clark, 2009; Varela et al., 
1991). These approaches largely rejected of the digital computer metaphor and the embrace 
of a picture of the brain as a dynamical system. 
The series of papers in this thesis represents one of the first systematic attempts to 
bridge the more externalist perspectives of enactive-embodied-extended cognitive sciences 
and ecological psychology, and the originally more internalist leaning of the FEP. We 
propose a compromise position between internalism and externalism, essentially using tools 
developed in the context of a theory of the brain (the FEP and active inference) to advance an 
agenda compatible with the externalist emphasis on embodied activity and ecological 
embeddedness. The papers in this thesis, and especially the last three chapters, propose a 
52 
novel reading of embodiment and enactment that relies on their role in information 
processing - and thus reject the externalist move against information theory in the cognitive 
sciences. We claim that externalist theory has, as it were, thrown away the information baby 
with the computation and representation bathwater; and that the resources of information 
theory, computational modelling, and the FEP that emerges from its application to Markov 
blanketed systems, is - despite its internalist appearances - a great boon to enactive or 
pragmatist theories. 
One of the contributions of the third chapter in this regard is to redefine affordances, 
providing ecological psychology with a mechanistic foundation based in theoretical biology. 
Crucially, the third paper extends the work done in the first paper by offering a new take on 
the construct of affordances, originally drawn from ecological psychology. Following recent 
work that syntheses ecological psychology and the enactive approach (Bruineberg & 
Rietveld, 2014; Chemero, 2009), as well as recent advances in the theory of active inference 
(Friston, Rigoli, et al., 2015; Parr & Friston, 2017), we redefine affordances via the FEP. 
Thanks to the framework provided by active inference, we distinguish the action policy itself 
- i.e., the possibilities for action that are available to the organism - and the affordance of 
that policy, which we interpret as the degree to which an organism is compelled to enact a 
policy. Under this reading, affordance is no longer construed as a possibility for action - that 
construct is instead resorbed under or subsumed by the notion of an action policy - but 
instead quantifies the extent to which an organism will be compelled to follow a given action 
policy. This gives us a mechanistic, quantitative grip on what the SIF calls 'solicitations'; i.e., 
those affordances that - 'here and now', in real-time interactions with the ecological niche - 
solicit the organism to act (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). We quantify the affordance of a 
given action policy as the negative expected free-energy associated with a given action 
policy. This allows us to propose a principle of most affordance that is just another form of 
the principle of least action, and which follows directly from the FEP. This principle of most 
affordance is another contribution to original knowledge made by this thesis.

The multiscale view proposed in this thesis challenges the narrow understanding of information processing and computational methods in the enactive approach to cognitive sciences. The externalist perspective of embodied and ecological cognitive sciences is bridged with the internalist leaning of the FEP by using tools developed in the context of the FEP and active inference. The rejection of information theory by externalist theory is seen as throwing away the baby with the bathwater, and the resources of information theory and computational modeling are viewed as a boon to enactive or pragmatist theories.
One of the contributions of the third chapter is redefining affordances based on theoretical biology, which provides ecological psychology with a mechanistic foundation. Affordances are distinguished from action policies, and the degree to which an organism is compelled to enact a policy is quantified as the affordance of that policy. This gives a mechanistic, quantitative understanding of what the SIF calls 'solicitations.' The affordance of a given action policy is quantified as the negative expected free-energy associated with that policy, which allows proposing a principle of most affordance, another form of the principle of least action, directly from the FEP. This principle of most affordance is another contribution to original knowledge made by this thesis.

Conclusion
The thesis presents a theoretical framework for understanding the organization of cognitive systems in living beings, based on the principles of active inference and free energy minimization. The framework integrates insights from cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ecological psychology, and provides a unifying account of the ways in which organisms interact with their environment and one another.
Chapter 1 introduces the concept of cultural affordances, which are the ways in which social and cultural practices shape the perceptual and attentional processes of individuals. Chapter 2 presents a mathematical formulation of free energy minimization as a principle of self-organization in living systems, and shows how this principle can be used to explain a wide range of phenomena in neuroscience and cognitive science.
Chapter 3 extends the framework to ecological systems and shows how free energy minimization can be used to understand the dynamics of populations and communities. Finally, Chapter 4 introduces the concept of multiscale integration and argues that it provides a way to move beyond traditional debates about the boundaries of cognition, by recognizing that cognitive processes are distributed across multiple levels of organization, from the cellular to the social.
Taken together, the chapters in this thesis provide a comprehensive and integrated account of the principles underlying cognitive organization in living systems. The framework presented here has the potential to inform future research in a wide range of fields, from cognitive science to ecology and social science.

3. The big picture: A multiscale free energy formulation 
The crux of our argument is that organisms can be described in terms of a (high dimensional) 
phase space induced by hierarchically nested Markov blankets. In other words, our ontology 
comprises populations of both spatially and temporally nested Markov blankets that occupy 
hierarchically nested regions in the total phase space of living systems. This sort of hierarchical 
organisation is a direct corollary of EST: since specific, functional (global) patterns of 
interacting (local) components need to be selected over competing alternatives to allow 
different levels of (informational, physical, chemical, biological, psychological, and 
sociocultural) organisation to emerge, the hierarchical nesting of Markov blankets instantiates 
Darwinian dynamics, which follows the same laws of statistical (or, strictly speaking, 
stochastic) thermodynamics, but in a nonequilibrium context that leads to self-organisation, 
self-assembly, and selective dynamics (Ao et al., 2013; Badcock, 2012; Friston, 2013; 
Martyushev & Seleznev, 2006). 
3.1. Nested Markov blankets 
To picture such hierarchical dynamics, it is useful to introduce the notion of a scale space. Scale 
spaces allow us to observe structures at different spatial scales. Imagine that you took a 
photograph, and then focused in progressively to examine smaller details. As you zoom in, you 
traverse a (spatial) scale space. The notion of a scale space is useful because the increase in 
scale, as we move from one hierarchical level of Markov blankets to the next, necessarily 
entails an increase in spatial scale. However, what were purposeful (i.e., free energy 
minimising) fluctuations at one scale now become fast random fluctuations at the next. This 
means that there is a concomitant increase in temporal scale as we ascend the spatial hierarchy. 
This composition of temporal and spatial scales is evident in the hierarchical organisation of 
the brain (Jung, Hwang, & Tani, 2015; Kiebel, Daunizeau, & Friston, 2008), and more broadly, 
suggests that self-organisation should occupy a limited domain (along the diagonal) of a scale 
space with spatial and temporal dimensions (Haken, 1983) (see Figure 2). Note that the use of 
a scale space is purely for descriptive purposes. The underlying system in question does not 
117 
change—just its level of description, the way it is measured, or the perspective taken on its 
hierarchical self-organisation.

3.2. Free energy formulation
Our approach to describing hierarchical self-organisation in living systems relies on a free energy
formulation that describes the flow of information across scales. Free energy is a measure of the
difference between an organism's (or system's) internal model of the world and the external reality
it seeks to model. This difference is manifested in a form of uncertainty or surprise, which the
system must resolve through adaptation or learning. By minimizing free energy, the organism can
maintain its internal model in alignment with external reality.
The free energy formulation is particularly suited to hierarchical systems because it allows us to
quantify the information flow between nested Markov blankets. This information flow can be
formalized in terms of a Bayesian model, where each level of the hierarchy corresponds to a
probability distribution over states of the system, conditioned on the states of the levels below.
By minimizing free energy, the system ensures that each level of the hierarchy is in agreement
with the level above, while still allowing for adaptability at each level.
The free energy formulation provides a unified framework for understanding the dynamics of
nested Markov blankets across multiple scales. By describing the flow of information between
these blankets, we can gain insight into the processes underlying self-organization and
adaptation in living systems.

Sure, here's a summary of Chapter 2:
Chapter 2 of the paper titled "Answering Schrödinger's question: A free-energy formulation" proposes a new way to approach the question of how living organisms maintain their organization and complexity in the face of the second law of thermodynamics. The chapter begins with a brief overview of Schrödinger's question and the challenges it poses to traditional views of biological order. The authors then introduce the concept of free energy, which they argue can provide a unifying framework for understanding how living systems maintain their organization.
The chapter then goes on to explain the mathematical underpinnings of free energy and how it can be applied to living systems. The authors propose a new formulation of free energy that takes into account the hierarchical structure of living systems and the nested Markov blankets that define their boundaries. This new formulation, they argue, can capture the complexity of living systems in a more comprehensive way than previous formulations of free energy.
The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of this new free-energy formulation for our understanding of living systems. The authors suggest that this formulation can help us to better understand the emergence of biological complexity and the evolution of life on Earth. They also suggest that it has potential applications in fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics, where the challenge of maintaining organization and complexity is also a key concern.

Abstract: 
The free-energy principle (FEP) is a formal model of neuronal processes that is widely 
recognised in neuroscience as a unifying theory of the brain and biobehaviour. More recently, 
however, it has been extended beyond the brain to explain the dynamics of living systems, and 
108 
their unique capacity to avoid decay. The aim of this review is to synthesise these advances 
with a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which 
integrates the FEP with Tinbergen's four research questions to explain biological systems 
across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo 
sapiens, before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that 
supplies the biological, cognitive, and social sciences with a computationally tractable guide 
to discovery.

In the previous chapter, 
I proposed a theoretical framework, called the cultural affordances framework, to model human 
social and cultural cognition as well as implicit cultural learning in human social groups. More 
specifically, the cultural affordances framework is a mechanistic theory of human enculturation 
and social cognition, the dynamics of which are formulated across spatial and temporal scales; 
i.e., the framework provides a model of the mechanisms, operative at various scales (from that 
of neuronal ensembles to that of cultural dynamics), in virtue of which human agents become 
encultured and acquire the cultural norms and ways of doing things that characterise their niche. 
109 
However, the cultural affordances model lacked a principled mathematical account of how the 
components of this multiscale mechanism interact, and remained mostly silent on the ways 
these components are integrated at and across the various spatial and temporal scales at which 
they exist. The purpose of this chapter is to provide precisely such an account of multiscale 
systematic integration.

1. Introduction 
As Schrödinger (1944) famously observed many years ago, living systems are unique among 
natural systems because they appear to resist the second law of thermodynamics by persisting 
as bounded, self-organizing systems over time. How is this remarkable feat possible? What is 
life? How is it realised in physical systems? And how can we explain and predict its various 
manifestations and behaviours? By asking such questions, Schrödinger inspired a new line of 
inquiry that broadly centres on evolutionary systems theory (EST), which has become one of 
the most pervasive paradigms in modern science. Closely related to complexity science, EST 
is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the pioneering efforts of theorists like Fisher, 
Wright, Haldane and Prigogine (Ao, 2005; Fisher, 1930; Sarkar, 1992; Wright, 1932), and 
has found expression in influential models such as Eigen and Schuster's hypercycles (Eigen 
& Schuster, 1979). Put simply, EST explains dynamic, evolving systems in terms of the 
reciprocal relationship between general selection and self-organisation (Badcock, 2012; 
Depew & Weber, 1995; Kauffman, 1993). 
Originating from biology, general selection entails three interacting principles of 
change: variation, selection, and retention (Caporael, 2001). This Darwinian process not only 
applies to organisms (i.e., natural selection), but acts on all dynamically coupled systems (e.g., 
molecules, neural synapses, behaviours, theories, and technologies; Blackmore, 2000; Cziko, 
1995; Mesoudi, Whiten, & Laland, 2006), and is a universal principle that cuts across both 
statistical and quantum mechanics (Ao, 2008; Campbell, 2016). On the other hand, self- 
organisation stems from dynamic systems theory in physics (Haken, 1983; Nicolis & 
Prigogine, 1977; Prigogine & Stengers, 1984), and refers to the emergence of functional, 
higher-order patterns resulting from recursive interactions among the simpler components of 
coupled dynamical systems over time (see Box 1). To date, research in EST has focused on 
complex adaptive systems—such as the brain (Haken, 1996; Kelso, 1995), social systems 
(Miller & Page, 2009), and the biosphere (Levin, 1998)—which adapt to the environment 
through an autonomous process of selection that recruits the outcomes of locally interacting 
components—within that system—to select a subset for replication or enhancement (Levin, 
2003). At the turn of the millennium, the principles of EST inspired a new theory in 
neuroscience called the free-energy principle (FEP). Drawn chiefly from statistical 
thermodynamics and machine learning, the FEP is a formal model of neuronal processes that 
was initially proposed to explain perception, learning and action (Friston, 2005; Friston, Kilner, 
& Harrison, 2006b), but has since been extended to explain the evolution, development, form, 
111 
and function of the brain (Friston, 2010). More recently, it has also been applied to biological 
systems across spatial and temporal scales, ranging from phenomena at the micro-scale (e.g., 
dendritic self-organisation and morphogenesis; Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 2015; 
Kiebel & Friston, 2011), across intermediate scales (e.g., cultural ensembles; Ramstead, 
Veissière, & Kirmayer, 2016), and at the macro-scale (e.g., natural selection; Friston & Ao, 
2011). We believe that this theory puts us in a strong position to answer Schrödinger's question, 
and at the same time, shed new light on the mind, body, behaviour, and society.

Evolutionary Systems Theory (EST) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP)
EST and FEP provide a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of complex, evolving systems, such as the brain, social systems, and the biosphere. General selection and self-organisation are the two key principles that underpin EST. General selection entails the processes of variation, selection, and retention, which apply to all dynamically coupled systems, not just organisms. Self-organisation, on the other hand, refers to the emergence of higher-order patterns resulting from recursive interactions among simpler components of coupled dynamical systems over time.
The FEP is a formal model of neuronal processes that was initially proposed to explain perception, learning, and action, but has since been extended to explain the evolution, development, form, and function of the brain. It has also been applied to biological systems across different spatial and temporal scales, from dendritic self-organisation and morphogenesis to cultural ensembles and natural selection.
By applying these principles to the study of complex, evolving systems, EST and FEP provide a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms that underlie the emergence and persistence of life, and shed new light on the mind, body, behaviour, and society.
1 / 1
We begin by describing how the FEP offers a plausible, mechanistic EST that applies 
to living systems in general. We then combine this variational principle with Tinbergen's four 
research questions in biology to describe a new scientific ontology—called variational 
neuroethology—that can be used to develop mathematically tractable, substantive explanations 
of living organisms. We conclude by applying this meta-theory to the most complex living 
system known to date—namely, ourselves—before translating this framework into a 
systematic research heuristic. In doing so, we hope to highlight a plausible, computationally 
tractable guide to discovery in the biological, cognitive and social sciences. 
2. The free energy formulation 
The FEP is a mathematical formulation that explains, from first principles, the characteristics 
of biological systems that are able to resist decay and persist over time. It rests on the idea that 
all biological systems instantiate a hierarchical generative model of the world that implicitly 
minimises its internal entropy by minimising free energy. In virtue of the self-organisation 
inherent in nonequilibrium steady-state, systems will apparently violate the second law of 
thermodynamics. See Ao, Chen, and Shi (2013) for an interesting treatment of relative entropy 
in this context (that does not require detailed balance assumptions). From our perspective, this 
sort of behaviour can be cast in terms of a dynamics (i.e., conservative flow) that appears to 
minimise a variational free energy, which constitutes an upper bound on the entropy of a 
system's Markov blanket (see Friston (2013) and Box 2). Technically, free energy is an 
information theoretic quantity that limits (by being greater than) the entropy of sensory 
exchanges between a biotic system (e.g., the brain) and the environment. A generative model 
is a probabilistic mapping from causes in the environment to observed consequences (e.g., 
sensory data); while entropy refers to the (long-term) average of surprise (or surprisal)—the 
negative log probability of sensory samples encountered by an agent (Friston, 2010). Under 
this formalism, for an organism to resist dissipation and persist as an adaptive system that is 
part of, coupled with, and yet statistically independent from, the larger system in which it is 
112 
embedded, it must embody a probabilistic model of the statistical interdependencies and 
regularities of its environment. We elaborate on this next. 
2.1. Living systems, ergodicity, and phenotypes 
All biological systems exhibit a specific form of self-organisation, which has been sculpted by 
natural selection to allow them to actively maintain their integrity by revisiting characteristic 
states within well-defined bounds of their conceivable phase spaces (see Box 1). In other 
words, there is a high probability that an organism will occupy a relatively small, bounded set 
of states—its viability set (Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014)—within the total set of possible states 
that it might occupy (i.e., its phase space). In terms of information theory, this means that the 
probability density function that describes the possible states of the system has low entropy. 
So, how do living systems perform this feat?

The FEP proposes that living systems achieve this by embodying a hierarchical generative model of the world, which enables them to predict the sensory input they expect to receive from their environment. By minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input, the system can minimize its free energy and thus maintain its viability set. This is achieved by adjusting its internal states and actions to bring the predicted and actual sensory input into alignment.
Importantly, the FEP proposes that living systems are non-ergodic, meaning that they do not sample their entire phase space uniformly over time. Instead, they tend to sample from a small subset of their phase space that is relevant to their viability. This is because their generative model is tailored to the specific statistical regularities and interdependencies of their environment, which allows them to predict and respond to the aspects of the environment that are most relevant for their survival and reproduction. This means that living systems exhibit a characteristic phenotype that is adapted to the particular ecological niche in which they are embedded.
Overall, the FEP provides a mechanistic explanation for how living systems are able to resist decay and persist over time by embodying a probabilistic model of their environment that allows them to maintain their viability set. By minimizing free energy, living systems are able to achieve active self-organization and adapt to their environment in a way that is tailored to their specific ecological niche.

This is simpler than it might seem, and rests on the fact that all living systems revisit a 
bounded set of states repeatedly (i.e., they are locally ergodic). At every scale—from the 
oscillations of neuronal activity over milliseconds, through to the pulsations of our heart and 
our daily routines—we find ourselves in similar states of mind and body. This is the remarkable 
fact about living systems. All other self-organising systems, from snowflakes to solar systems, 
follow an inevitable and irreversible path to disorder. Conversely, biological systems are 
characterised by a random dynamical attractor—a set of attracting states that are frequently 
revisited. Indeed, the characteristics by which we define living systems are simply statements 
about the characteristic, attracting states in which we find them (Friston, 2013). This set of 
attracting states can be interpreted as the extended phenotype of the organism—its morphology, 
physiology, behavioural patterns, cultural patterns, and designer environments (Clark, 2013). 
This conception of the extended phenotype as the set of attracting states of a coupled dynamical 
system is supported by evidence from simulation studies of morphogenesis, (e.g., Friston et al., 
2015). Further supportive evidence comes from studies of cancer genesis and progression, 
where the success of approaches employing endogenous networks provides a striking example 
of employing statistical methods (the Markov blanket formalism) to separate internal 
(phenotypical) states from external ones (Yuan, Zhu, Wang, Li, & Ao, 2017). This conception 
of the topology of the phase space is supported by recent work on early myelopoiesis in real 
biological systems as well (Su et al., 2017). In this study, the core molecular endogenous 
network under consideration was cast as a set of dynamical equations, yielding structurally 
robust states that can be interpreted in relation to known cellular phenotypes. 
113 
The implications of this are profound. It means that all biotic agents move, 
systematically, towards attracting states (i.e., those with high probability) to counter the 
dispersive effects of random fluctuations. Consequently, any living system will appear, on 
average, to move up the probability gradients that define its attracting set—and the very 
characteristics responsible for its existence. Thus, living systems do not just destroy energy 
gradients (by gravitating towards free energy minima), they also create and maintain them by 
climbing the probability gradients that surround such extrema. In other words, living systems 
carve out and inhabit minima in free energy landscapes, precluding the dissipation of their 
states over phase space. This (nonequilibrium steady-state) behaviour differentiates living 
states from other states, like decay and death (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Jarzynski, 1997; 
Schrödinger, 1944; Tomé, 2006). Technically, this gradient-building behaviour can be 
expressed as the flow over a landscape that corresponds to the log probability of any state being 
occupied. This probability is also known as 'Bayesian model evidence' (Friston, 2010). This 
means living systems are effectively self-evidencing—they move to maximise the evidence of 
their existence (Hohwy, 2016). So how do they achieve this? 
This is where the FEP comes in. It asserts that all biological systems maintain their 
integrity by actively reducing the disorder or dispersion (i.e., entropy) of their sensory and 
physiological states by minimising their variational free energy (Friston (2010); see Figure 1 
and Box 2). Because the repertoire of functional or adaptive states occupied by an organism is 
limited, the probability distribution over these characteristic states has low entropy: there is a 
high probability the organism will revisit a small number of states. Thus, an organism's distal 
imperative of survival and maintaining functional states within physiological bounds (i.e., 
homeostasis and allostasis) translates into a proximal avoidance of surprise (Friston, 2010).

In simpler terms, the article is discussing how living systems, including humans, are different from other self-organizing systems like snowflakes or solar systems. Living systems have a set of attracting states, or a set of states that they frequently revisit, which can be interpreted as their extended phenotype (e.g., morphology, behavior, cultural patterns, etc.). Living systems move towards these attracting states to counter the effects of random fluctuations and to maintain their states over phase space. They achieve this by actively reducing the disorder or dispersion of their sensory and physiological states by minimizing their variational free energy. This helps organisms maintain their integrity and avoid surprise, which is important for survival and maintaining functional states within physiological bounds.

2.2. Free energy, surprise, and Markov blankets 
To understand the subtle but important difference between surprise and free energy, we have 
to look more carefully at what constitutes a system. Clearly, one needs to differentiate between 
the system and its environment—those states that constitute or are intrinsic to the system and 
those that are not. To do this, we have to introduce a third set of states that separates internal 
from external states. This is known as a Markov blanket. Markov blankets establish a 
conditional independence between internal and external states that renders the inside open to 
the outside, but only in a conditional sense (i.e., the internal states only 'see' the external states 
through the 'veil' of the Markov blanket; Clark, 2017; Friston, 2013). The Markov blanket can 
be further divided into 'sensory' and 'active' states that are distinguished in the following way: 
internal states cannot influence sensory states, while external states cannot influence active 
states (Friston, 2012). With these conditional independencies in place, we now have a well- 
defined (statistical) separation between the internal and external states of any system. A 
Markov blanket can be thought of as the surface of a cell, the states of our sensory epithelia, or 
carefully chosen nodes of the World Wide Web surrounding a particular province. 
With Markov blankets in mind, it is fairly straightforward to show that the internal 
states must—by virtue of minimising surprise—encode a probability distribution over the 
external states; namely, the causes of sensory impressions on the Markov blanket. This brings 
us back to free energy. Free energy is a functional (i.e., the function of a function) that describes 
the probability distribution encoded by the internal states of the Markov blanket. Note that this 
is different from surprise, which is a function of the states of the Markov blanket itself. In other 
words, free energy is a function of probabilistic beliefs, encoded by internal states about 
external states (i.e., expectations about the probable causes of sensory input). When these 
beliefs are equal to the posterior probability over external states, free energy becomes 
equivalent to surprise. Otherwise, it is always slightly greater than (i.e., imposes an upper 
bound on) surprise. This means that living systems can be characterised as minimising 
variational free energy, and therefore surprise, where the minimisation of variational free 
energy entails the optimisation of beliefs about things beyond or behind the Markov blanket 
(see Box 2). This inferential aspect leads us to notions like embodied inference (Bruineberg, 
Kiverstein, & Rietveld, 2016; Gallagher & Allen, 2016), the Bayesian brain (Knill & Pouget, 
2004), the Bayesian cell (Kiebel & Friston, 2011), and even a Bayesian culture (Friston & 
Frith, 2015; Ramstead et al., 2016).

The concept of Markov blankets helps us to distinguish between internal and external states of a system, and to understand how these states are related to each other. The Markov blanket separates the internal states from the external states in a way that makes the internal states conditionally independent of the external states. This means that the internal states are influenced by the external states only through the Markov blanket. The Markov blanket can be divided into sensory and active states, where the sensory states are influenced by the external states and the active states influence the external states.
The internal states must encode a probability distribution over the external states, which are the causes of sensory impressions on the Markov blanket, in order to minimise surprise. Free energy is a functional that describes the probability distribution encoded by the internal states of the Markov blanket. Free energy is a function of probabilistic beliefs, encoded by internal states about external states, and is different from surprise, which is a function of the states of the Markov blanket itself. When beliefs are equal to the posterior probability over external states, free energy becomes equivalent to surprise. Living systems can be characterised as minimising variational free energy, and therefore surprise, by optimising beliefs about things beyond or behind the Markov blanket.
The concept of Markov blankets has important implications for understanding a range of phenomena, including embodied inference, the Bayesian brain, the Bayesian cell, and even a Bayesian culture.

states from other states, like decay and death (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Jarzynski, 1997; 
Schrödinger, 1944; Tomé, 2006). Technically, this gradient-building behaviour can be 
expressed as the flow over a landscape that corresponds to the log probability of any state being 
occupied. This probability is also known as 'Bayesian model evidence' (Friston, 2010). This 
means living systems are effectively self-evidencing—they move to maximise the evidence of 
their existence (Hohwy, 2016).

The extended phenotype can be conceptualized as the set of attracting states of a coupled dynamical system. This means that living systems move towards these attracting states to counteract the dispersive effects of random fluctuations. As a result, living systems not only destroy energy gradients but also create and maintain them by climbing the probability gradients that surround such extrema. This behaviour differentiates living states from other states, like decay and death. This gradient-building behaviour can be expressed as the flow over a landscape that corresponds to the log probability of any state being occupied. This probability is also known as Bayesian model evidence. Therefore, living systems are effectively self-evidencing—they move to maximize the evidence of their existence.

3. The big picture: A multiscale free energy formulation 
The crux of our argument is that organisms can be described in terms of a (high dimensional) 
phase space induced by hierarchically nested Markov blankets. In other words, our ontology 
comprises populations of both spatially and temporally nested Markov blankets that occupy 
hierarchically nested regions in the total phase space of living systems. This sort of hierarchical 
organisation is a direct corollary of EST: since specific, functional (global) patterns of 
interacting (local) components need to be selected over competing alternatives to allow 
different levels of (informational, physical, chemical, biological, psychological, and 
sociocultural) organisation to emerge, the hierarchical nesting of Markov blankets instantiates 
Darwinian dynamics, which follows the same laws of statistical (or, strictly speaking, 
stochastic) thermodynamics, but in a nonequilibrium context that leads to self-organisation, 
self-assembly, and selective dynamics (Ao et al., 2013; Badcock, 2012; Friston, 2013; 
Martyushev & Seleznev, 2006). 
3.1. Nested Markov blankets 
To picture such hierarchical dynamics, it is useful to introduce the notion of a scale space. Scale 
spaces allow us to observe structures at different spatial scales. Imagine that you took a 
photograph, and then focused in progressively to examine smaller details. As you zoom in, you 
traverse a (spatial) scale space. The notion of a scale space is useful because the increase in 
scale, as we move from one hierarchical level of Markov blankets to the next, necessarily 
entails an increase in spatial scale. However, what were purposeful (i.e., free energy 
minimising) fluctuations at one scale now become fast random fluctuations at the next. This 
means that there is a concomitant increase in temporal scale as we ascend the spatial hierarchy. 
This composition of temporal and spatial scales is evident in the hierarchical organisation of 
the brain (Jung, Hwang, & Tani, 2015; Kiebel, Daunizeau, & Friston, 2008), and more broadly, 
suggests that self-organisation should occupy a limited domain (along the diagonal) of a scale 
space with spatial and temporal dimensions (Haken, 1983) (see Figure 2). Note that the use of 
a scale space is purely for descriptive purposes. The underlying system in question does not 
117 
change—just its level of description, the way it is measured, or the perspective taken on its 
hierarchical self-organisation.

3.2. Multiscale free energy formulation
To formalise this notion of hierarchical self-organisation, we can use a multiscale free energy
formulation. Free energy can be thought of as a measure of how well a system is doing, in terms
of minimising its internal energy, while satisfying constraints that ensure it is in an appropriate
state. In the context of hierarchical systems, we can decompose free energy into levels that
correspond to different scales in the hierarchy. At each level, we can define a free energy
functional that represents the system's state of affairs, in terms of its relevant variables, given
the information available at that level.
The total free energy of the system is then the sum of all these levels of free energy. This
allows us to quantify the system's state of affairs, across multiple scales, and to understand
how the system operates across different levels of description.
Importantly, this formulation allows us to understand how the nested Markov blankets operate
across different scales, and how they work together to give rise to the behaviour of the system
as a whole. At each scale, the Markov blanket serves to create a boundary that separates the
system from its environment, and that enables the system to maintain a particular state, in
terms of its relevant variables. At the same time, the Markov blanket also allows the system to
interact with its environment, in a way that maintains its state.
Overall, the multiscale free energy formulation provides a powerful framework for
understanding the hierarchical self-organisation of living systems, and for exploring the
dynamics of their nested Markov blankets. It also provides a way of understanding how living
systems maintain their organisation, despite the constant pressures of internal and external
fluctuations, and how they are able to evolve and adapt over time, through selective dynamics.

4.1. Variational neuroethology applied: Hierarchically mechanistic minds 
The FEP is best known in neuroscience, where it has been used to explain the structure, 
function, and dynamics of the brain. In this context, the FEP concords with predictive coding 
by describing the brain as a hierarchical 'inference machine' that minimises prediction error 
by seeking to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down (neuronally-encoded) predictions 
(Clark, 2013, 2015; Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2016). This occurs in two ways: we can either 
improve our predictions by altering internal states (i.e., perception); or we can act upon the 
world to confirm our predictions (i.e., action). Thus, action and perception operate 
synergistically to optimise an organism's (Bayesian) model of the environment. As discussed, 
the FEP also transcends predictive coding by extending beyond the brain to explain behaviour, 
the phenotype, and all other biotic phenomena that span evolutionary timescales and spatially 
distributed ensembles. However, to understand the particular features of the human brain, the 
FEP requires recourse to research in psychology and the social sciences (e.g., evolutionary and 
cognitive anthropology), which target the specific ecobiopsychosocial processes responsible 
for the embodied models and behaviour of Homo sapiens in particular. 
To address this need, an interdisciplinary EST of the embodied brain has recently been 
forwarded called the hierarchically mechanistic mind (HMM). Initially proposed to unify 
evolutionary and developmental psychology, the HMM is an evidence-based model of 
neurocognition and biobehaviour that synthesises the FEP with major paradigms in psychology 
to situate the brain within the broader evolutionary, developmental, and real-time processes 
that produce human behaviour, phenotypes, and niches (Badcock, 2012; Badcock, Davey, 
Whittle, Allen, & Friston, 2017). Specifically, this model defines the human brain as an 
embodied, complex adaptive system that adaptively minimises the entropy of its internal (i.e., 
sensory and physiological) states through recursive interactions between hierarchically 
organized, functionally differentiated neural subsystems (Badcock, 2012). This hierarchy 
ranges from lower-order, highly segregated neurocognitive systems responsible for 
124 
sensorimotor processing, through to the highly integrated association areas that underlie the 
sophisticated cognitive faculties unique to humans (Badcock et al., 2017). The HMM resonates 
with structural and functional imaging studies in network neuroscience, which show that the 
brain entails a multiscale hierarchical organisation characterised by the repeated encapsulation 
of smaller neural elements in larger ones (Kaiser, Hilgetag, & Kötter, 2010; Park & Friston, 
2013; also see Figure 4, panel A). Predictive coding approaches suggest that this sort of 
architecture entails a hierarchical generative model that minimises prediction error via 
recurrent message-passing between cortical levels (Figure 4, panel B), affording a 
neurobiologically plausible, mechanistic theory of the functional integration of anatomically 
segregated neural networks (Bastos et al., 2012; Park & Friston, 2013; Shipp, 2016).

Supplementary Information Box 1. Dynamical systems theory. 
Evolutionary systems theory (EST), the ambient meta-theory that frames the free energy 
formulation, subsumes dynamical systems theory (DST). DST is a mathematical formulation 
of systems dynamics. Living systems have been productively modelled using the resources of 
DST, and so a few of the central concepts borrowed from DST by EST should be explicated. 
The core feature of dynamicist approaches is their emphasis on dynamics that unfold over time. 
The free energy formulation shares its dynamicist commitments with closely related 
approaches in cognitive neuroscience and psychology: the ecological and enactive approaches 
to cognition and behaviour. Indeed, the free energy formulation has been proposed as a 
computationally-tractable, mathematical formulation of enactivism from first principles (Allen 
& Friston, 2016; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Friston, 2013; Kirchhoff, 2015, 2016). For 
example, all the process theories that follow from the FEP, from predictive coding through to 
the belief propagation in decision-making, rest explicitly on formulating neuronal dynamics as 
a gradient descent on variational free energy (Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & 
Pezzulo, 2017). 
Dynamical systems are mathematical models that are used to represent physical systems 
with temporally extended dynamics. These dynamics are expressed as systems of (ordinary, 
stochastic or random) differential equations that describe trajectories or paths through phase 
space. They are defined over states of the system and their flow depends upon the current value 
of the system states. The analytic intractability of some of these systems of equations led to the 
development of qualitative methods to study dynamical systems. The strategy here is to 
qualitatively describe the dynamical evolution of a system by describing the abstract space of 
all of its possible states. A 'phase space' is an abstract representation of all the possible states 
of a system. It is an n-dimensional (usually metric) space, where each dimension corresponds 
to a state variable of the system (e.g., position, velocity, etc.). A point in this n-dimensional 
phase space is an n-tuple that can be interpreted as assigning a value to each variable along 
each dimension. Because a point in the phase space of a dynamical system specifies a value for 
every variable of the system, any given point in this space represents a complete description of 
the system at a given instant. 
How does this help us analyse the dynamics of a system? In dynamical systems theory, 
time is represented not as a separate dimension, but as a dynamical trajectory or sequence of 
states through the phase space. This trajectory is determined by the topology of the phase space, 
134 
which translates the constraints to which the system is subject. That is, the topology of the 
phase space translates the system of differential equations that govern the dynamics of the 
system being studied, usually in terms of attracting sets, manifolds or orbits (Arnold, 2003; 
Beer, 1995; Crauel & Flandoli, 1994; Freeman, 1994). 
DST has especially been employed to understand self-organisation. Self-organisation 
is ubiquitous is nature: weather patterns, like rainstorms and lightning, emerge spontaneously; 
fluids crystallize to form structured lattices; bubbles arise in sea foam, and pop. This occurs 
because the spontaneous emergence of self-organized dynamics increases the efficiency of 
energy gradient dissipation and entropy production within that system (i.e., it increases its 
internal order). Self-organised dynamics emerge around an energy gradient, and optimise the 
flow of energy in the system about that energy gradient, until the system succumbs to decay 
(England, 2013). DST provides qualitative and computationally tractable formalisms to model 
such self-organising dynamics.

Supplementary Information Box 2. Bayesian inference and prediction.
Bayesian inference and prediction are central to the free energy principle (FEP). Bayesian
inference is a method for updating the probability of a hypothesis in light of new evidence. In
Bayesian inference, the probability of a hypothesis is called the prior probability, and the
probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is called the posterior probability. The
posterior probability is obtained by multiplying the prior probability by the likelihood of the
evidence given the hypothesis and normalising the result.
For example, suppose that a doctor wants to know the probability that a patient has a certain
disease. The doctor may have some prior belief about the probability of this disease based on
the patient's age, gender, and medical history. Then, the doctor may perform some tests, such
as a blood test, to obtain evidence about the patient's disease status. Based on the test results,
the doctor updates their prior belief and calculates the posterior probability of the patient
having the disease.
In the FEP, Bayesian inference is used to update beliefs about the hidden causes of sensory
inputs. The brain is modelled as a probabilistic generative model that predicts sensory inputs
based on hidden causes, and Bayesian inference is used to update the probability distribution
over hidden causes given sensory inputs. Specifically, the brain minimises the free energy of
its generative model, which is an upper bound on the negative log evidence (i.e., the
probability of the sensory inputs given the hidden causes). Minimising free energy is
equivalent to maximising the posterior probability of the hidden causes given the sensory
inputs, which corresponds to Bayesian inference.
Bayesian prediction is a method for making predictions about future events based on
probabilistic models. In Bayesian prediction, the probability distribution over future events is
updated based on current evidence. Bayesian prediction is closely related to Bayesian inference,
since both involve updating probability distributions. In the FEP, Bayesian prediction is used
to make predictions about future sensory inputs based on the current sensory inputs and the
probabilistic generative model. Specifically, the brain minimises the expected free energy of
its generative model, which corresponds to minimising the expected surprise of future sensory
inputs given the current sensory inputs.

Dynamical systems theory (DST) is a mathematical framework used to model and analyze complex systems that change over time. These systems can range from physical phenomena such as weather patterns and fluid dynamics to biological systems such as the behavior of neurons in the brain.
At the core of DST is the concept of a state space, which represents all possible states of the system being modeled. Each point in the state space corresponds to a unique combination of values for all relevant variables of the system. The trajectory of the system over time is represented as a path through the state space, with each point in the path representing the system's state at a particular time.
DST is particularly useful for understanding self-organization, which refers to the emergence of complex, ordered structures and behaviors in systems that are not organized by an external force. Self-organizing systems can be modeled as attractors in the state space, which are regions of the space that draw nearby trajectories towards them. These attractors can represent stable, periodic, or chaotic behaviors of the system.
One important concept in DST is sensitivity to initial conditions, also known as the butterfly effect. This refers to the idea that small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes over time, making it difficult to predict the long-term behavior of complex systems.
Overall, DST provides a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems over time and has been applied to a wide range of fields, including physics, biology, economics, and psychology.

Predictive Coding hypothesis
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Predictive Coding hypothesis is a theory of brain function that proposes that the brain is constantly making predictions about the environment and updating those predictions based on incoming sensory information. According to this theory, the brain works to minimize prediction error, which is the difference between the predicted sensory input and the actual sensory input.
The idea is that the brain uses a hierarchical system of neural networks to make predictions at different levels of abstraction. Higher levels of the network make more abstract predictions, while lower levels make more concrete predictions. When incoming sensory information matches the predictions made by the network, there is little prediction error and the system can remain stable. However, when there is a mismatch between predictions and incoming sensory information, prediction error is generated and the system must update its predictions to minimize the error.
Predictive coding has been proposed as a unifying theory for understanding many aspects of brain function, including perception, attention, learning, and memory. It has also been used to explain some aspects of mental illness, such as hallucinations and delusions, as a result of a failure to properly update predictions based on sensory input.
The predictive coding hypothesis has gained popularity in recent years and has been supported by a growing body of experimental evidence, although it remains a subject of debate and ongoing research.

Supplementary Information Box 2. Variational inference and the free energy 
formulation. 
Organisms do not have access to the 'true' probabilistic contingencies that describe the entire 
organism-niche system, that is, the actual relations of dependencies between environmental 
states and states of the organism. After all, the biotic system itself is 'hidden', as it were, behind 
a Markov blanket, which endows it with statistical independence from random fluctuations and 
other influences from the 'outside'. However, it does have access to quantities that define the 
variational free energy, and it can leverage the gradients defined by the free energy landscape 
to resists entropic erosion, through the process of 'active inference' (Friston, Kilner, & 
Harrison, 2006a; Friston, Daunizeau, Kilner, & Kiebel, 2010). Here, the organism's action- 
perception cycles can be seen as self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016); that is, as producing evidence 
that allows it to infer its own existence.

Variational inference is a statistical technique used to approximate the probability distribution of a complex system based on limited data. It involves selecting a simpler, known distribution that is similar to the unknown distribution, and then adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between the two distributions.
In the context of the free energy formulation, variational inference is used to approximate the true posterior distribution over hidden states and causes based on sensory data. This involves selecting a simpler, known distribution (i.e. a recognition model) that is similar to the true posterior, and then adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between the two distributions. The resulting approximation is known as the 'recognition density', and it allows for efficient computation of the posterior over hidden states and causes.
The free energy formulation is used to specify a generative model of the organism-niche system, which describes how sensory data are generated by hidden states and causes. The generative model includes both environmental states and the internal states of the organism, and it is used to calculate the probability of sensory data given hidden states and causes. The free energy formulation then expresses the difference between the true posterior over hidden states and causes and the recognition density as a single quantity, the variational free energy, which is a measure of the organism's uncertainty about the true state of the world.
In the context of active inference, the organism's action-perception cycles are used to gather sensory data that are then used to update the recognition density and infer the hidden causes that generate the sensory data. The goal of active inference is to minimize the variational free energy by selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about the true state of the world. By doing so, the organism is able to resist entropic erosion and maintain its internal organization over time.

The brain is constantly confronted with a wealth of sensory information that must be processed efficiently to facilitate appropriate reactions. One way of optimizing this processing effort is to predict incoming sensory information based on previous experience so that expected information is processed efficiently and resources can be allocated to novel or surprising information. Theoretical and computational studies led to the formulation of the predictive coding framework (Friston 2005, Hawkins and Blakeslee 2004, Mumford 1992, Rao and Ballard 1999). Predictive coding states that the brain continually generates models of the world based on context and information from memory to predict sensory input. In terms of brain processing, a predictive model is created in higher cortical areas and communicated through feedback connections to lower sensory areas. In contrast, feedforward connections process and project an error signal, i.e. the mismatch between the predicted information and the actual sensory input (Rao & Ballard, 1999). The predictive model is constantly updated according to this error signal.

Although central concepts of this framework reach back to early perception science (Helmholtz 1863), these ideas remain in conflict with mainstream models of cortical processing in which feedforward projections integrate essential information and feedback connections serve only modulatory purposes (i.e. gain control).

In recent years however, the concept of predictive coding has been validated by a number of brain imaging studies investigating predictive feedback and the processing of prediction errors (i.e. Alink et al. 2010, Bar 2007, DenOuden et al. 2010, Egner et al. 2010, Rauss et al. 2011, Smith and Muckli 2010, Summerfield et al. 2006, Todorovic et al. 2011). Predictive coding is considered a significant paradigm shift in neuroscience, affecting every level of cortical processing and warrants inclusion in a unifying theory of the brain (Friston 2010), even though empirical evidence remains relatively scarce

Summarize: In neuroscience, predictive coding (also known as predictive processing) is a theory of brain function which postulates that the brain is constantly generating and updating a "mental model" of the environment. According to the theory, such a mental model is used to predict input signals from the senses that are then compared with the actual input signals from those senses.[1] With the rising popularity of representation learning, the theory is being actively pursued and applied in machine learning and related fields.[2]

The phrase 'predictive coding' is also used in several other disciplines such as signal-processing technologies and law in loosely-related or unrelated senses.

ABSTRACT 
We study the task of prompting large-scale language models to perform multi- 
step reasoning.Existing work shows that when prompted with a chain of 
thoughts (CoT), sequences of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning 
steps towards a i nal answer, large language models can generate new reasoning 
chains and predict answers for new inputs. A central question is which reasoning 
examples make the most effective prompts. In this work, we propose complexity- 
based prompting, a simple and effective example selection scheme for multi-step 
reasoning. We show that prompts with higher reasoning complexity, i.e., chains 
with more reasoning steps, achieve substantially better performance on multi- 
step reasoning tasks over strong baselines. We further extend our complexity- 
based criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), 
where we sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the 
majority of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple 
chains). When used to prompt GPT-3 and Codex, our approach substantially 
improves multi-step reasoning accuracy and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) 
performance on three math benchmarks (GSM8K, MultiArith, and MathQA) and 
two BigBenchHard tasks (Date Understanding and Penguins), with an average 
+5.3 and up to +18 accuracy improvements. Compared with existing example 
selection schemes like manual tuning or retrieval-based selection, selection based 
on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-eff i cient. 
Further results demonstrate the robustness of performance gains from complex 
prompts under format perturbation and distribution shift. 
1INTRODUCTION 
We consider the problem of prompting large language models for multi-step reasoning. Recent 
breakthroughs (Wei et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2022b) show that language models, when large 
enough (>100B parameters), exhibit the emergent ability (Wei et al., 2022a) of performing complex 
multi-step reasoning when provided with only a few reasoning examples. In the regime of large 
models, prompting achieves comparable or even better performance than full training set i netuning 
while being substantially more sample-eff i cient (Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022; Lewkowycz 
et al., 2022). In particular, Wei et al. (2022b) show that chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompts, sequences 
of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards i nal answers (Fig. 1A), can elicit 
strong reasoning capabilities from large language models for complex tasks such as math problems. 
This work studies example selection in chain-of-thoughts multi-step reasoning. Example selection 
is a central problem in the prompting literature (Liu et al., 2022; Rubin et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022; 
Lazaridou et al., 2022). It asks what instances make the best prompts for solving the tasks of interest. 
For CoT prompting, example selection is further related to annotation eff i ciency, as CoT requires 
manually-annotated reasoning chains. For datasets where reasoning annotations are easy to obtain, 
one may want to know which annotated chains make the best prompt; if the annotations are hard to 
obtain, one may identify the best cases to annotate, rather than annotating the entire dataset. 
We propose complexity-based prompting, a new example selection scheme for chain-of-thoughts 
multi-step reasoning. Existing sample selection methods are usually based on manual tries (Wei

The article "Complexity-Based Prompting for Multi-Step Reasoning" discusses the problem of prompting large language models to perform multi-step reasoning. The authors propose a new example selection scheme for chain-of-thoughts (CoT) multi-step reasoning called complexity-based prompting. CoT is a sequence of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, which can elicit strong reasoning capabilities from large language models.
The authors propose that prompts with higher reasoning complexity, i.e., chains with more reasoning steps, achieve substantially better performance on multi-step reasoning tasks over strong baselines. They also extend their complexity-based criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), where they sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the majority of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple chains).

The article also discusses the importance of example selection in the prompting literature and how it is related to annotation efficiency, as CoT requires manually-annotated reasoning chains. The authors propose that their selection based on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-efficient. The results also demonstrate the robustness of performance gains from complex prompts under format perturbation and distribution shift.
Overall, the article proposes a novel approach to selecting the most effective examples for prompting large language models to perform complex multi-step reasoning tasks.

We further extend the complexity-based selection criteria from the input space (the prompts) to the 
output space (reasoning chains generated by the language model). Our extension is based on the idea 
of self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022b;a), where they sample multiple reasoning chains (instead of 
using greedy decoding) from the model that lead to possibly different answers, then choose the 
majority of the generated answers. Here we propose complexity-based consistency, where instead of 
taking a majority vote among all generated chains, we vote over the top K complex chains, as shown 
in Fig. 1C. In §4.2, we will show that complexity-based consistency leads to further performance 
gains, on top of the existing gain from complexity-based prompting. 
Putting everything together, our methods achieve new state of the art performance on three math 
benchmarks(GSM8K,MultiArith, andMathQA)andtwoBigBenchHardtasks(DateUnderstanding 
and Penguins) with substantial performance gains over Wei et al. (2022b). We show that, compared 
with existing sample selection schemes, complexity-based prompting achieves better performance 
in most cases (see §4.2). Furthermore, performance gains from complex samples are consistent 
in different prompt distributions (in-distribution, transfer, and noisily-labeled, see §4.2) and are 
also consistent with regard to alternative proxies for complexity (e.g., question or formula lengths, 
see §4.3) when the dataset does not contain annotated reasoning chains. A careful analysis shows 
that the number of reasoning steps is the most prominent factor, over confounders like prompt 
lengths or the number of input cases (§4.3). We hope this work will open new research possibilities 
in in-context learning, large language models, and multi-step reasoning.

Emergent Abilities and Multi-Step ReasoningWith the recent trend in scaling language 
models (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), a central question is what unique abilities 
emerge as models become large (Kaplan et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a). Generally, the ability to 
follow the format of given prompts (typically few-shot) thus solving the corresponding tasks (also 
2 
Preprint 
referred as in-context learning), is something that large language models are particularly skilled 
at (Shin et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Among the wide language understanding task spectrum, 
we are particularly interested in multi-step reasoning because of its two uniqueness: (1). multi- 
step reasoning is a task where large models substantially outperform smaller models (Wei et al., 
2022b), versus performance gains on tasks like sentiment classif i cation can be very limited with 
large models (Shin et al., 2020); (2).multi-step reasoning is where few-shot prompting starts 
to outperform full training set i ne-tuning, even when i ne-tuning is conducted on the same large 
model (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). This work takes an important step forward in multi-step reasoning 
by showing the critical role of prompt complexity. 
Chain-of-Thoughts ReasoningA prominent work demonstrating the multi-step reasoning of 
language models is chain-of-thoughts prompting (Fig. 1A), proposed by Wei et al. (2022b). They 
show that the reasoning ability can only be elicited by chain of thoughts, but not standard prompting 
where an answer directly follows a question without intermediate reasoning steps. Further works 
show that CoT can be improved by self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022b), pretraining the model 
with latex-formated data (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), context selection (Creswell et al., 2022), or even 
adding certain magic phrases like "Let's think step by step" (Kojima et al., 2022). The original CoT 
paper (Wei et al., 2022b) uses 8 manually written examples as the prompt, which are reused by most 
follow-up works. Our work sits in the context of CoT reasoning, and propose a new complexity- 
based prompt selection that substantially outperforms the original CoT. 
Example Selection for PromptingDesigning prompts can be challenging due to the instability, 
as multiple works have shown the performance is sensitive to prompt, task, dataset, and model 
changes (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022). Despite works on automatic prompt 
searching (which is more suitable for smaller models, e.g., Shin et al., 2020; Li & Liang, 2021), 
currently, prompt engineering for large models is (still) a community-wide collective trial and error 
effort (there is even a prompt marketplace named PromptBase). The diff i culty is that it is extremely 
hard to extract generalizable regularity from empirical observations that can form effective selection 
criteria. Onenotableexceptionissimilarity-basedpromptselection, whichretrievesthemostsimilar 
training instances as the prompt for a given test case (Rubin et al., 2022). Yet for CoT prompting, 
retrieving different prompts for different test cases requires reasoning chain annotations for the 
whole training set, which compromises the advantage of being few-shot. Given this background, 
our core contribution is identifying complexity as an effective and robust selection criterion and in 
many cases, it outperforms existing prompt selection schemes while being annotation-eff i cient. 
Relation to Classical Semantic ParsingThe procedure of chain of thoughts prompting is 
conceptually similar to classical semantic parsing where one generates a logical form then executes 
it upon a knowledge base to reach a i nal answer (Liang, 2016; Cheng et al., 2019). The practice 
of sampling then voting is also similar to marginalizing out semantic parses (Yin et al., 2018). 
There are further works linking the relationship between in-context learning and classical Bayesian 
inference (Wei et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). From our perspective, we tend to view chain-of- 
thoughts as l exible, language model styled "logical forms" which are "executed" by the language

The article discusses a new approach for prompting large language models to perform multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach, called complexity-based prompting, selects prompts based on their complexity, with the idea that more complex prompts can better elicit multi-step reasoning in the model. The authors also propose complexity-based consistency, where the model generates multiple reasoning chains that lead to possibly different answers, and the top K complex chains are voted on for consistency. The experiments show that complexity-based prompting outperforms existing prompt selection methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several math benchmarks and other tasks. The article also provides a background on multi-step reasoning, chain-of-thoughts prompting, and prompt selection for large language models. The authors hope that their work will open new research possibilities in in-context learning, large language models, and multi-step reasoning.

3COMPLEXITY-BASEDPROMPTING 
We study multi-step reasoning tasks, and use math word problems, mathematical problems 
expressed in natural language, as our testbed. This task, as is measured by solve rate (accuracy), 
is to predict the answer (typically a number) of a given math word problem via intermediate steps. 
We follow the chain-of-thoughts prompting framework and compare all prompting schemes using 
GPT-3 text-davinci-002 and Codex code-davinci-002. An example problem, as well 
as the chain-of-thoughts workf l ow, is shown in Fig. 1A. The input is a stack of a few (often 8) CoT 
cases followed by a test question, then the language model continues generating an output CoT for 
the test question. Our goal is to improve the reasoning accuracy by identifying and exploiting more 
effective input and output reasoning chains. 3

3.1SELECTINGCOMPLEXSAMPLES ASPROMPTS 
Our method is to simply choose complex prompts over simple ones. We hypothesize that language 
models' reasoning performance will increase if we use complex instances as in-context "training 
example," as they intuitively subsume simpler instances (Richardson & Sabharwal, 2022). We 
def i ne complex instances as instances with more reasoning steps (Fig. 1B), as the name "multi- 
step reasoning" indicates. Note that using reasoning steps as the notion of complexity is also the 
practice of previous works like (Sugawara et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2021). We further def i ne a step as 
a line, separated by the linebreak "\n". 
There are two aspects that need more discussion: (1) The notion of complexity. There are other 
complexity indicators than number of steps, such as questions lengths or the length of the underlying 
formula for solving a given problem. We will show that the trend that better performance comes with 
more complex prompts is consistent across various complexity indicators, such as question lengths 
and formula lengths. Consequently, for datasets that do not have annotated reasoning chains, we 
can use questions lengths to identify complex instances, then only annotate the identif i ed few-shot 
instances, thus reducing the annotation cost. (2) Confounders of number of steps. The increase in 
performance with more complex examples in the prompt could be explained by correlated factors 
like the increase in the total number of reasoning steps in the prompts or just the increased length of 
the prompt. To account for this, we evaluate prompts with simpler examples but the same number 
of reasoning steps (e.g. 24 cases with 3 steps vs. 8 cases with 9 steps, both of 72 steps in total). We 
also consider prompts of the longest lengths (but not most steps). We show that the number of steps 
per example is the most prominent source of performance gains over confounders. 
3.2COMPLEXITY-BASEDCONSISTENCY 
Complexity-based prompting can be further enhanced with a new output selection method following 
the same intuition, which we present in this section. Existing evidence shows that the expressive 
neural models can take shortcuts during reasoning, relying on spurious correlations that inevitably 
exist in the training data (Mudrakarta et al., 2018; Sugawara et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2021). This often 
leads to suboptimal generalization to unseen data. To alleviate this issue, we explicitly promote 
outputs with more complex reasoning chains at inference time. Specif i cally, our method follows 
the self-consistency practice in Wang et al. (2022b), which samples N reasoning chains for a test 
question. Different reasoning chains may lead to different answers, and Wang et al. (2022b) takes 
the majority answer as the prediction. In our case, instead of voting among all N chains, we only 
vote among top K (K ≤ N) complex (more steps) reasoning chains, as shown in Fig. 1C. We dub 
our method Complexity-based Consistency. Note that when K = N we recover the original self- 
consistency method. In our experiments, we set N to 50, and observe that the optimal K is always 
smaller than N (typically 30-40). This provides clear evidence that voting among more complex 
reasoning chains generalizes better than voting among all. We also show that if we do the opposite 
and vote among answers produced by K simplest reasoning chains, the accuracy is always worse 
than voting among all. This further validates that complex chains, not simple chains, should be 
considered more during decoding.
