Well I'm always bringing home the dogs that's found beside the road I feed them and I pet
them and they keep me on my toes well but now it's gone a bit too far I don't see why
it's me that has to take the strays in from the whole damn galaxy but I'm the stray dog
man and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the home but I wish the ones
in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
Well I was sitting in the back yard in a t-shirt drinking a beer it was a hot muggy evening
but the sky was crystal clear well I heard an engine pop in but there was no one on the
lane so I shrugged and looked to heaven rubbed my eyes and looked again there was a kind of
flying picker with a glow across the back and as I watched it hover there I flew this gunny
sack well that pick up truck got fuzzy then it flashed into the sky and that gunny sack
bounced off the roof and it landed with a cry well I'm the stray dog man and I do what I can
give them pop some love and end the home but I wish the ones in space would go find another
place and leave me at my doggies here alone
Well now old Rover bound it over he sniffed around the sack then he took off for running
and he ain't ever coming back well poor Pido was the next to go he bit down on that thing
he died before he finished and he started turning green kind of saddened four legs sticking
straight up in the air well now that gunny sack it rustled then it opened dark and white with
the ugliest damn critter that I ever saw inside well it crawled out stretched and freeing
itself then it ate poor Fido Raw picked up the tractor and gulped it down and sat back with
the young well by now I was getting my pee see that was a brand new John Deere but I'm
the stray dog man and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the home but I
wish the ones in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
well now I got a collar on it and I hold it to the shed it tried to eat the padlock but
it nails instead well it cried all night out there alone but I knew what to do I put a
clock inside a mitten but it ain't that suffer too guess I got kind of hungry when the alarm
went off it was kind of cute when you got to know him though I named him Ursa Major
it's cause he is a major pain in the earth well I finally got him paper trained and I
soon was glad to find that everywhere that I would go orders would tag behind well the
other dogs except him now he eats the ones that fight the twelve of them are nasty hunting
rabbits late at night the rabbit thinks he's smart he hides inside a tree well Ursa eats
the tree and I'm the stray dog man and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the
home but I wish the ones in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies
here alone well now I thought that was the end of it but when a month went by another
fly and pick up through a sack out on the fly well it struggled and it rumbled in that
gunny baggy burst and the thing that was inside it ate Ursa Major first well now it happens
every month or so and I'm getting kind of vexed as soon as I get fond of one it gets
beaten by the next so I'm building me a rocket next time I see a sack I'm going to toss it
in the nose going and I'll throw that sucker back cause I'm the stray dog man and I do
what I can give them pop some love and end the home but I wish the ones in space would
go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone yes I wish the ones in
space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
