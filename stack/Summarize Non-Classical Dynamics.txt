Summarize "harmony-seeking computations: the science of non-classical dynamics"
"Harmony-seeking computations: the science of non-classical dynamics" is a scientific paper that discusses the use of computational techniques to study non-classical dynamics in physical systems. Non-classical dynamics refers to behavior that cannot be described by classical Newtonian mechanics, such as chaotic systems and self-organizing systems. The paper discusses the use of computational methods, such as numerical simulations and machine learning techniques, to study and understand these complex systems. The goal of this research is to better understand the underlying principles of non-classical dynamics and to use this knowledge to predict and control the behavior of these systems.
Summarize the book "physics avoidance".
I'm sorry, but I am not aware of a book titled "physics avoidance." Could you please provide more information or clarify your request?
This collection of nine free-standing essays offers a fresh perspective on science and language and a fascinating critique of much of contemporary philosophy. The essays can be grouped as follows: Chapter 1 serves as an introduction and a brief for pragmatism; Chapters 2 and 5 concern science; Chapters 3 and 4 deal with historical figures (Leibniz and Duhem); Chapters 6 and 7 critique contemporary analytic metaphysics; and Chapters 8 and 9 discuss language and mathematics. The style is opinionated, contrarian, humorous, and expansive. The essays focus on case studies that develop in detail some of the themes of Wilson's earlier Wandering Significance.
