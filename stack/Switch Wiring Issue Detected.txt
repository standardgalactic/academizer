Based on your description, it sounds like there might be an issue with the wiring configuration of your light switch. Typically, in a standard switch wiring, power should flow to the switch and then to the light. If you're observing that there is power at the switch only when it's turned off, it could indicate a few possible issues:
Miswired Switch:
The switch may be wired incorrectly. This is a common issue, especially in DIY installations or in older homes where wiring standards might have been different.
Faulty Switch:
The switch itself could be faulty or damaged, which can disrupt the flow of electricity even when it's in the 'on' position.
Neutral Wire Issues:
Problems with the neutral wire connection could also cause unusual behavior in electrical circuits.
Wiring Short or Open Circuit:
There might be a short circuit or an open circuit somewhere in the wiring. This could be due to damaged wires, loose connections, or other electrical faults.
It's crucial to address electrical issues with caution. If you're not experienced with electrical work, I would strongly recommend contacting a licensed electrician to inspect and repair the issue. Incorrectly handling electrical wiring can be dangerous and poses a risk of electrical shock or fire.
