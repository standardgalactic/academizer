Abstract 
For several decades, cooperative control of autonomous mobile robots has been an active research area with potential appli- 
cations in dynamic areas such as agriculture, industrial plants, and the military. Although numerous research studies on 
pattern formation using multiple mobile agents have been conducted, no algorithm for symmetric pattern formation that is 
independent of the number of agents and prioritizes user control has been introduced. This article demonstrates an attempt 
to manifest an end-to-end symmetrical pattern in a swarm of mobile robots. Here, a two-staged paradigm named SymSwarm 
is developed, which incorporates the novelty of forming symmetrical formations around a point within a coveted area via 
decentralized communication among the swarm. SymSwarm is built on a novel concept of a bio-inspired state model called 
compete and point state model (CPSM), which enables smarter and more robust computation and self-regulation. While 
most bio-inspired models focus on the characteristics of bees, ants, cats, chimpanzees, and a variety of other animals, this 
paradigm focuses on the competitive sentiment and leadership ability of human beings to shape the CPSM mentioned above. 
The algorithm for acquiring symmetrical points is developed using the circle polygon analogy in Cartesian geometry. The 
following sections propose a decentralized communication mechanism for adjacent consecutive robots as well as a heuristic 
nearest point i nder algorithm. The proposed paradigm is evaluated using robotics simulator (V-REP), and the results indicate 
that it is consistently successful and has a low rate of pattern formation error in the presence or absence of obstacles in the 
environment.

1 Introduction 
Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in swarm 
robotics as well as the collaboration of relatively simple 
robotic agents for the successful implementation of com- 
munal tasks. Over the last two decades, the annual increase 
in the number of research papers on swarm intelligence 
has been more than 90% [1, 2]. Inspired by swarm intel- 
ligence observed in social species, different bio-inspired 
meta-heuristic algorithms, such as pulse-coupled oscilla- 
tors (PCO)-based synchronization [3], PSO algorithm [4], 
ant colony optimization (ACO)-based multipath routing [5,

robotic motion techniques is a topic of great interest in cur-

al. [22], where a group of robots converges to form a circular pattern without a central commanding unit. This algorithm was developed to address the challenges of coordination in a semi-synchronous environment and provided insights into handling decentralized swarm patterns.
Other approaches to decentralized swarm pattern formation have utilized various bio-inspired models, yet SymSwarm introduces a unique aspect with its Compete and Point State Model (CPSM). This model is distinct from the conventional animal-inspired strategies, drawing from competitive and leadership-driven behaviors observed in human interactions. The CPSM model plays a crucial role in achieving symmetrical formations by allowing each robot to dynamically calculate its position based on local communication with neighboring robots, enabling self-regulated formation even in the presence of obstacles.
SymSwarm���s two-staged algorithm consists of an initial formation stage where a leader robot is selected to establish a reference point around which other robots position themselves, and a secondary stabilization stage that ensures a resilient formation despite environmental disruptions. This approach allows the swarm to autonomously adjust to changes without reliance on a central control unit, thereby minimizing communication costs and enhancing flexibility.
The authors evaluated the SymSwarm paradigm using V-REP simulations, which demonstrated high accuracy in achieving symmetrical formations with low error rates in both obstacle-free and obstacle-laden scenarios. This adaptability makes SymSwarm a promising approach for applications requiring robust and flexible swarm formations, such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and dynamic assembly tasks in constrained spaces.
In summary, SymSwarm represents a significant advancement in decentralized swarm robotics by combining bio-inspired algorithms with human-like decision-making traits, facilitating symmetrical pattern formations that are independent of swarm size and environmental obstacles. Future work is suggested to explore the implementation of SymSwarm in real-world scenarios, as well as potential enhancements to further improve obstacle avoidance and inter-robot communication efficiency.

In the field of swarm robotics, substantial progress has been made in developing algorithms and frameworks to manage multi-robot systems effectively. Various decentralized and bio-inspired algorithms have contributed to creating specific patterns, enabling collaboration among robots, and managing resources in dynamic environments. However, these advancements have typically addressed individual aspects of the challenges in swarm robotics���such as decentralized control, pattern formation, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot communication���without tackling all these challenges in a unified approach.
SymSwarm attempts to bridge this gap by introducing a two-staged algorithm that encompasses decentralized communication, symmetrical pattern formation, and obstacle avoidance, all while maintaining flexibility in the swarm's configuration based on robot count. This novel approach differs from previous studies by ensuring strict symmetry in the swarm pattern formation without a central controlling device, which reduces communication costs and makes the system more resilient.
In SymSwarm���s first stage, a leader robot is selected to initiate the pattern and guide other robots by establishing reference points, a process that mimics a centralized system but operates fully decentralized. This design allows other robots to sequentially align themselves, adapting to obstacles and changes dynamically. The second stage focuses on pattern stabilization, ensuring the formation remains intact under environmental changes.
While previous works, such as those by Erol et al., Flocchini et al., and Samitha and Pubudu, have presented decentralized methods for pattern formation, they often either required centralized components or lacked full autonomy in a real-world scenario. SymSwarm's innovation lies in its decentralized yet coordinated model that is adaptable to real-world applications, as demonstrated in V-REP simulations. The simulations showed that SymSwarm could consistently form symmetrical patterns and adapt to obstacles, thus proving its effectiveness.
In conclusion, SymSwarm presents a comprehensive framework that addresses key limitations in previous research, offering a more realistic and scalable approach for practical swarm robotics applications. Future research could further refine SymSwarm by implementing it in physical robots and optimizing its communication protocols for more complex and unpredictable environments.

Swarm algorithms are advancing at an expeditious pace, 
not only in the research phase but also in real-world appli- 
cations. Under the concept of smart farming, companies 
like SwarmFarm Robotics and Fendt provide farmers with 
swarms of agricultural UGVs (unmanned ground vehicle) to 
perform diverse tasks such as planting, fertilizer application, 
weed and insect control, irrigation, and harvesting according 
to a centrally planned schedule. Supported by the SAGA 
(Swarm Robotics for Agricultural Applications) project, 
Albanietal.[33]presentedtheimplementationofacollective 
behavior for weed monitoring and mapping using swarms 
of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the semiconductor 
industry, the SWILT (Swarm Intelligence Layer to Con- 
trol Autonomous Agents) project [34] is deployed to model 
UxV. Swarm algorithm-based projects such as SMAVNET 
(Swarming Micro Air Vehicle Network) [35], SWARMIX 
[36], and CPSwarm [37] are used in the military for a vari- 
ety ofoperational purposes,including surveillance missions, 
targeted assassinations,and threat identif i cation. By forming 
a swarm of heterogeneous agents, diverse objectives such as 
connecting different rescue teams, exploring disaster sites, 
localizing victims, and directing rescuers toward them can 
be accomplished. 
Along with the aforementioned works, several pieces of 
research facilitated the development of our work. Guzel et 
al. [38] focused on circle formation using mobile robots for 
scenarioswithandwithoutobstacles.Inthiswork,aleaderis 
assigned initially, and patterns can be formed independently 
of the swarm���s size. Using the consensus approach, Teddy 
et al. [39] proposed an algorithm to def i ne decentralized 
motion coordination control of multi-agent systems. This 
proposal does not require a predef i ned leader, and through 
two consecutive stages, all agents move collectively into a 
rectangular pattern from any initial deployment. For evalua- 
tion,eachrobot���srespectivevelocitiesandheadingdirections 
are tracked regularly for both simple and noisy environ- 
ments. This approach inspired us to a two-staged algorithm 
where there is no predef i ned leader but a progressively 
selected leader exploits. Unlike all other works, ours does 
not require a leader whom followers follow; rather, it acts 
as a pathf i nder, with implementers accepting the suggested 
paths. Our work combines the aforementioned concepts of a 
two-staged approach and decentralized intercommunication 
to achieve the objective of uniform circle formation with 
desired properties in noiseless and noisy environments. Our 
proposed two-staged paradigm is evaluated using swarms 
of mobile robots, which have been overlooked in previous 
research. 
Table 1 presents a summary of some recent pattern for-

The field of swarm robotics has evolved rapidly, with numerous studies exploring pattern formation, collision avoidance, and decentralized control mechanisms for multiple robots. One of the major frameworks,
physicomimetics
, uses scientific principles to enable smooth pattern formations in simulations and real hardware environments. For example, Javier et al. developed a pattern formation algorithm that allows robots to avoid collisions while forming predetermined patterns using techniques like the Voronoi partitioning method and the Hungarian algorithm.
In hybrid approaches, such as the
pdPSO
(primal���dual Particle Swarm Optimization) proposed by Emmanuel and Effirul, local pheromone trails enable effective communication and pattern formation among robots. Another approach, introduced by Hahmin and Dong, uses
potential functions
to determine the relative positions of robots, allowing the formation of symmetric patterns.
Potential Field Methods
(PFM), like those used by Basma et al., provide decentralized control for robot swarms, capable of navigating through tight spaces and avoiding local minima.
Some applications extend beyond laboratory settings. For instance, in agriculture, companies like
SwarmFarm Robotics
use swarm algorithms to control autonomous ground vehicles for tasks such as planting and fertilization. In military contexts, projects like
SMAVNET
and
SWARMIX
use swarming strategies for surveillance, disaster response, and reconnaissance missions.
Guzel et al.
focused on circular pattern formations using leader robots in obstacle-rich environments, while
Teddy et al.
presented a decentralized method where multi-robot systems move into formations without needing a predefined leader.
Our work builds on these foundations by proposing a
two-staged, decentralized, and symmetrical pattern formation algorithm
for mobile robot swarms. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not rely on predefined leaders or initial positions. Instead, it uses an
adaptive leader-selection mechanism
that allows robots to independently form symmetrical patterns based on the number of robots present, ensuring scalability and adaptability in both noisy and noise-free environments.
Summary of Key Contributions:
Two-Staged Algorithm
: Inspired by approaches that gradually organize agents, we propose a system that assigns a temporary leader to navigate obstacles and establish formation points.
Symmetrical Pattern Formation
: Unlike prior works, our method forms symmetrical patterns dynamically, independent of initial positions or number constraints.
Decentralized Communication
: Robots communicate locally to coordinate positions, maintaining formation even with environmental changes.
The proposed system is evaluated under simulation, where it effectively forms stable patterns in both obstacle-free and obstacle-filled environments. This independence from a centralized control unit and reliance on local intercommunication make our approach robust, adaptable, and ready for practical, real-world deployment, addressing the limitations identified in existing studies.
Table 1 in our work provides a comparative overview of recent pattern formation methods, highlighting their limitations, such as reliance on initial configurations or centralized components. Our methodology overcomes these drawbacks, offering a decentralized, symmetrical formation strategy that is flexible and autonomous, marking a significant advancement in swarm robotics.

4 Proposed Algorithm
The proposed solution, illustrated in Fig. 1, is a comprehensive end-to-end framework for decentralized symmetrical pattern formation in a swarm of robots. The following sections elaborate on the critical components and inspiration behind this innovative approach.
4.1 Bio-Inspired Compete and Point State Model (CPSM)
The
Compete and Point State Model (CPSM)
is a bio-inspired framework for optimizing, computing, and decentralizing control among a swarm of mobile robots. Inspired by human behavioral dynamics, this model integrates competition, leadership, and coordination within the swarm, emulating human social structures in decision-making and hierarchy formation.
In CPSM���s initial phase, robots engage in a
competition phase
, where they are assigned probabilities that determine their likelihood of being designated as either a leader or an implementer. This process mirrors human social structures, where roles of leadership and followership are often established through subtle competitive mechanisms. Once this phase is complete, one robot is designated as the
leader
, while the remaining

robots (where

is the total number of robots and
n

) assume the role of
implementers
.
The selected leader then takes on responsibilities akin to those of a human leader���motivating, guiding, and assigning roles to maximize the potential of each implementer. The leader robot���s primary task is to calculate a set of coordinates that will enable the implementer robots to form a symmetrical pattern around a designated center. This phase draws inspiration from the human tendency to coordinate and optimize group behavior for collective success.
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2
Fig. 1
shows the overall workflow of the CPSM-based paradigm, from competition to symmetry formation.
Fig. 2
provides a breakdown of the CPSM model:
(a)
Competition Phase
: Robots compete to be designated as leader or implementers.
(b)
Selection Phase
: One robot is selected as the leader, while the others assume implementer roles.
(c)
Formation Phase
: Implementers occupy the coordinates determined by the leader, achieving symmetry.
In Fig. 2:
Yellow circles
represent competitor robots.
Green circle
denotes the selected leader.
Red circles
are implementer robots.
The leader robot���s final responsibility in the CPSM framework is to compute and distribute the set of destination coordinates necessary for symmetry. The implementer robots then autonomously decide which coordinates to occupy, using a
nearest point finder algorithm
(discussed in Section 4.2.2.2) to optimize their movements and reduce travel distance.
This structured approach allows for an efficient and adaptive formation of symmetrical patterns without the need for central control, paving the way for practical, real-world applications in decentralized robotic systems.

symmetric positions are sent to implementers at once. But 
the approach will not form adaptable symmetry due to dam- 
age caused to any robot in the second stage. As a result, the 
paradigm can form symmetry with intact robots. Previously, 
no other efforts were available to construct a symmetri-

7 Conclusion and Future Work
This article introduced
SymSwarm
, a two-staged paradigm designed to organize a swarm of mobile robots into symmetrical formations in 2D space. This framework allows for decentralized communication and dynamic adaptation, enabling real-world applications where symmetrical formations are crucial for efficiency. SymSwarm utilizes a unique, geometry-based approach to ensure robust pattern formation that maintains symmetry despite environmental obstacles.
The SymSwarm approach progresses through two stages:
Leader Selection and Implementer Assignment
: In this initial phase, robots independently select a leader through a competitive process. The chosen leader then computes the coordinates for implementer robots to form the desired symmetrical pattern.
Symmetry Stabilization and Robustness
: After implementing the pattern, the system continues to adapt, although it lacks adaptability if any robot becomes inoperative post-stabilization.
Key Findings
Self-Healing and Resilience
: In the first stage, SymSwarm can adjust autonomously to maintain formation. However, in the second stage, the symmetry remains intact only if all robots are operational.
Obstacle Adaptation
: The paradigm has demonstrated high resilience in the presence of static obstacles, maintaining symmetry with only minor oscillations in inter-robot distance.
Accuracy
: Simulation results show that SymSwarm achieves precise formation with a cumulative error of fewer than 0.6 units in setups involving up to eight robots. This consistency is retained in both obstacle-free and obstacle-laden environments.
Future Directions
The SymSwarm paradigm shows promise for deployment across various fields, including industrial automation, military operations, disaster response, and pandemic management. However, several areas for improvement and expansion remain:
Enhanced Nearest Point Finding Algorithm
: The current heuristic method does not guarantee absolute nearest-distance determinations. Future iterations could benefit from advanced algorithms to improve precision in point selection.
Improved Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance
: Integrating recent navigation methods and obstacle avoidance strategies could decrease completion times and enhance robustness in complex environments. Research in adaptive obstacle avoidance, such as [32], [72], and [73], could make SymSwarm more versatile.
Real-World Testing and Scalability
: Future work should implement SymSwarm in physical mobile robots to assess real-world performance and further explore its scalability for larger swarms.
By addressing these aspects, SymSwarm could become a comprehensive solution for decentralized symmetrical pattern formation in various practical applications.
