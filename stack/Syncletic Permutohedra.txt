Here is a summary of the article about glial cells in the gut:

- Glial cells in the enteric nervous system, also known as the "second brain", help coordinate digestion along with neurons. They were long overlooked but are now an area of increasing study. 

- New tools have revealed glial cells play many active roles like maintaining gut tissue, mediating contractions, regulating stem cells and coordinating with the microbiome and immune system. 

- There are likely multiple subtypes of enteric glial cells with distinct functions. A recent study identified 6 subtypes, including "hub cells" that sense mechanical force through a channel and help move food through the gut.

- Enteric glial cells are involved in gut disorders like IBD and may contribute to pain. Stress can cause glia to damage neurons and recruit immune cells, causing inflammation. 

- Targeting glial cells offers potential as a new approach for treating gastrointestinal diseases and associated pain. Understanding their diverse roles is important for developing future treatments.

- More research is still needed to fully map and characterize all enteric glial subtypes and functions in the complex environment of the digestive tract. Their dynamic roles make them central to our understanding of digestive health and disease.

Intelligence in complex biological systems is not just a function of an algorithmic digital (non neural plastic enabled) Neural Network in our CNS. 

In particular if it���s modelled with biologically implausible oversimplification.  Especially as in Generative AI based LLMs, that are also limited by their statistical token autocomplete prediction process (that���s prone to produce confabulated stories to fulfill prompts into hallucinated responses), trained on often duplicated text data sources containing inappropriate, unsafe, biased and simple bad/incorrect data!  

Not to mention the fact that these systems do not posses the rational reflective processing (Kahneman System 2) metacognition, that enables thinking about thoughts. So as to produce modified safe and trustworthy responses guided by ethical awareness and imaginative reasoning. 

Complex biological intelligence in high order Mammals/Apes, Cetaceans, Corvids, Cephlapods, etc., possess faculties of reasoning and sentient qualia-based understanding, in part supported by faculty of cognitive consciousness awareness, causal reality models and common sense.

Intelligence and understanding is an EMBODIED process (over multiple experienced sensory sources) in living biological complex system, tuned by Evolution by trillions of simultaneous trials based on systems surviving and thriving over billions of years.  It gifts these entities a unique���sense of being in the world���.  To be aligned to humans that sense of being is a necessary part.  It defines the ���human condition���.

Furthermore, It���s likely that humans possess intuitive awareness of solutions to problems never formally trained on, as evidenced many times in individuals with extraordinary #mathematicalintuition.

So when folk tell you that we are close to producing intelligence and understanding at human levels and beyond, that are generally applicable across use cases we encounter in life, I think they seriously underestimate the hard won depth of faculties we possess.  The issues I���ve mentioned above are known unknowns either in beginning stages of research or not addressed yet.  There���s likely unknown unknowns as well.

Martin Ciupa raises several insightful points about the nature of intelligence and its manifestation in both biological and artificial systems. Here's a breakdown of his key ideas:
Complex Biological Intelligence
: He highlights that intelligence in complex biological systems like mammals, cetaceans, corvids, and cephalopods is more than just a digital, algorithmic process. These organisms exhibit intelligence through embodied experiences, cognitive consciousness, causal reality models, and common sense. This type of intelligence is the product of evolutionary processes and sensory experiences, endowing these beings with a unique "sense of being in the world."
Limitations of AI and LLMs
: Ciupa points out the limitations of current AI models, particularly Generative AI and Language Models (LLMs) like GPT. He notes their reliance on statistical token prediction, which can lead to confabulated and hallucinated responses. He also mentions the issues of training on duplicated, inappropriate, or incorrect data sources, which can introduce biases and unsafe outputs.
Lack of Metacognition in AI
: AI systems currently lack Kahneman's System 2 type reflective processing. This means they don't possess metacognition - the ability to think about thoughts, guiding responses through ethical awareness and imaginative reasoning.
Human Intelligence and Intuition
: Ciupa underscores that humans often intuitively understand and solve problems they've never been formally trained on. This aspect of human intelligence, demonstrated in areas like mathematical intuition, is not yet replicable in AI.
Underestimation of Human Intelligence
: His overarching argument is that those who believe we are close to achieving human-level intelligence in AI are underestimating the depth and complexity of human faculties. The aspects he mentions (e.g., embodied processing, ethical awareness, intuitive problem-solving) are either in early research stages or completely unaddressed in AI development.
Unknowns in AI Development
: Finally, he suggests that there are "unknown unknowns" in AI development ��� aspects of intelligence and consciousness that we have yet to understand or consider.
Ciupa's perspective is a reminder of the vast gap between biological intelligence and the current state of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the complexity and depth of the human condition that AI has yet to approach.

Permutohedron

In mathematics, the permutohedron (also spelled permutahedron) of order n is an (n ��� 1)-dimensional polytope embedded in an n-dimensional space. Its vertex coordinates (labels) are the permutations of the first n natural numbers. The edges identify the shortest possible paths (sets of transpositions) that connect two vertices (permutations). Two permutations connected by an edge differ in only two places (one transposition), and the numbers on these places are neighbors (differ in value by 1).


The permutohedron of order 4
The image on the right shows the permutohedron of order 4, which is the truncated octahedron. Its vertices are the 24 permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4). Parallel edges have the same edge color. The 6 edge colors correspond to the 6 possible transpositions of 4 elements, i.e. they indicate in which two places the connected permutations differ. (E.g. red edges connect permutations that differ in the last two places.)

The permutohedron, in mathematics, is a polytope that represents the permutations of a set of natural numbers. Here's a summary:
Definition
: A permutohedron of order n is an (n ��� 1)-dimensional polytope situated in an n-dimensional space.
Vertices
: Its vertices are labeled with all possible permutations of the first n natural numbers.
Edges
: The edges of the permutohedron denote the shortest paths between permutations, achieved through transpositions (swapping two elements). Each edge connects two permutations that differ in just two positions, where the values of these positions are adjacent numbers.
Example - Permutohedron of Order 4
: An illustration of this concept is the permutohedron of order 4, which takes the shape of a truncated octahedron. It has 24 vertices, corresponding to the permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4). The edges are color-coded to represent the six possible transpositions among four elements, with each color indicating the positions where the permutations differ. For instance, permutations differing in the last two positions are connected by edges of the same color (e.g., red).

According to G��nter M. Ziegler (1995), permutohedra were first studied by Pieter Hendrik Schoute (1911). The name permuto��dre was coined by Georges Th. Guilbaud and Pierre Rosenstiehl (1963). They describe the word as barbaric, but easy to remember, and submit it to the criticism of their readers.[1]

The alternative spelling permutahedron is sometimes also used.[2] Permutohedra are sometimes called permutation polytopes, but this terminology is also used for the related Birkhoff polytope, defined as the convex hull of permutation matrices. More generally, V. Joseph Bowman (1972) uses that term for any polytope whose vertices have a bijection with the permutations of some set.

The historical background and terminology related to permutohedra are as follows:
Early Studies
: Pieter Hendrik Schoute is credited with the initial study of permutohedra in 1911, as mentioned by G��nter M. Ziegler in 1995.
Coining of the Term
: The term "permuto��dre" was coined by Georges Th. Guilbaud and Pierre Rosenstiehl in 1963. They acknowledged the term as being somewhat 'barbaric' but memorable and left it open to criticism from their readers.
Alternative Spelling
: The spelling "permutahedron" is an alternative that is sometimes used.
Terminology Variations
: While permutohedra are often called "permutation polytopes", this term can be confusing as it is also used for Birkhoff polytopes. Birkhoff polytopes are defined as the convex hull of permutation matrices. Furthermore, V. Joseph Bowman in 1972 used "permutation polytopes" to refer to any polytope with vertices that correspond bijectively to the permutations of a set.

, and their length is ���2.

Two connected vertices differ by swapping two coordinates, whose values differ by 1.[3] The pair of swapped places corresponds to the direction of the edge. (In the example image the vertices (3, 2, 1, 4) and (2, 3, 1, 4) are connected by a blue edge and differ by swapping 2 and 3 on the first two places. The values 2 and 3 differ by 1. All blue edges correspond to swaps of coordinates on the first two places.)

The number of facets is 2n ��� 2, because they correspond to non-empty proper subsets S of {1 ... n}. The vertices of a facet corresponding to subset S have in common, that their coordinates on places in S are smaller than the rest.[4]

Facet examples
For order 3 the facets are the 6 edges, and for order 4 they are the 14 faces.
The coordinates on places i where i ��� S are marked with a dark background. It can be seen, that they are smaller than the rest.

The square on top corresponds to the subset {3, 4}. In its four vertices the coordinates on the last two places have the smallest values (namely 1 and 2).
order 3	order 4
1-element subsets	2-element subsets	1-element subsets	2-element subsets	3-element subsets
			 	 
More generally, the faces of dimensions 0 (vertices) to n ��� 1 (the permutohedron itself) correspond to the strict weak orderings of the set {1 ... n}. So the number of all faces is the n-th ordered Bell number.[5] A face of dimension d corresponds to an ordering with k = n ��� d equivalence classes.

Face examples

The images above show the face lattices of the permutohedra of order 3 and 4 (without the empty faces).
Each face center is labelled with a strict weak ordering. E.g. the square on top as 3���4���|���1���2, which represents ({3, 4}, {1, 2}).
The orderings are partially ordered by refinement, with the finer ones being on the outside.
Moving along an edge toward the inside means merging two neighbouring equivalence classes.

The vertex labels a���|���b���|���c���|���d interpreted as permutations (a,���b,���c,���d) are those forming the Cayley graph.

Facets among the faces
The before mentioned facets are among these faces, and correspond to orderings with two equivalence classes.
The first one is used as the subset S assigned to the facet, so the ordering is (S, Sc).

The images below show how the facets of the n-permutohedron correspond to the simplical projection of the n-cube.
The binary coordinate labels correspond to the subsets S, e.g. 0011 to {3, 4}.
(The vertex projected to the center does not correspond to a facet. Nor does its opposite vertex in the n-cube, which is not part of the projection.)

The permutohedron-like Cayley graph of S4 (see here for a comparison with the permutohedron)
The permutohedron is vertex-transitive: the symmetric group Sn acts on the permutohedron by permutation of coordinates.

The permutohedron is a zonotope; a translated copy of the permutohedron can be generated as the Minkowski sum of the n(n ��� 1)/2 line segments that connect the pairs of the standard basis vectors.[6]

The vertices and edges of the permutohedron are isomorphic to one of the Cayley graphs of the symmetric group, namely the one generated by the transpositions that swap consecutive elements. The vertices of the Cayley graph are the inverse permutations of those in the permutohedron.[7] The image on the right shows the Cayley graph of S4. Its edge colors represent the 3 generating transpositions: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

This Cayley graph is Hamiltonian; a Hamiltonian cycle may be found by the Steinhaus���Johnson���Trotter algorithm.

The relationship between the permutohedron and the Cayley graph of the symmetric group is quite fascinating and highlights the deep connections within mathematical structures. Here's a summary of the key aspects:

Tesselation of space by permutohedra of orders 3 and 4
The permutohedron of order n lies entirely in the (n ��� 1)-dimensional hyperplane consisting of all points whose coordinates sum to the number

1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2.
Moreover, this hyperplane can be tiled by infinitely many translated copies of the permutohedron. Each of them differs from the basic permutohedron by an element of a certain (n ��� 1)-dimensional lattice, which consists of the n-tuples of integers that sum to zero and whose residues (modulo n) are all equal:

x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 0
x1 ��� x2 ��� ... ��� xn (mod n).

���
���
���
1
���{\displaystyle A_{n-1}^{*}}. Accordingly, this lattice is sometimes called the permutohedral lattice.[8]

Thus, the permutohedron of order 4 shown above tiles the 3-dimensional space by translation. Here the 3-dimensional space is the affine subspace of the 4-dimensional space R4 with coordinates x, y, z, w that consists of the 4-tuples of real numbers whose sum is 10,

x + y + z + w = 10.
One easily checks that for each of the following four vectors,

(1,1,1,���3), (1,1,���3,1), (1,���3,1,1) and (���3,1,1,1),
the sum of the coordinates is zero and all coordinates are congruent to 1 (mod 4). Any three of these vectors generate the translation lattice.

The tessellations formed in this way from the order-2, order-3, and order-4 permutohedra, respectively, are the apeirogon, the regular hexagonal tiling, and the bitruncated cubic honeycomb. The dual tessellations contain all simplex facets, although they are not regular polytopes beyond order-3.
