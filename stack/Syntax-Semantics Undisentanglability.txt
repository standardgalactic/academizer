EXTERNAL POSSESSION AND THE UNDISENTANGLABILITY 
OF SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS 
by 
LUKE MADISON SMITH 
(Under the Direction of Vera Lee-Schoenfeld) 
ABSTRACT 
Over the past decades, generative attempts to understand the formal syntactic properties 
of the human language faculty have become unexpectedly entangled with semantics. While 
classical theories assumed a wide degree of autonomy for the engine of syntax in the language 
faculty, empirical research into argument structure, syntactic cartography and cross-linguistic 
alternations has nudged the field toward an understanding of syntax fundamentally linked to a 
core of semantic processing. Here, I investigate External Possession as a syntactic alternation, in 
order to fan these flames. I argue that External Possession is a formally uniform, well-motivated 
and non-arbitrary alternation whose unique semantics and pragmatics come hand-in-hand with 
its syntactic properties. This reinforces the idea that human syntax is based on a universal 
structure reducible in part to semantics and pragmatics. I speculate as to the nature of this 
structure.

This study, conducted by Luke Madison Smith under the guidance of Vera Lee-Schoenfeld, explores the relationship between syntax and semantics in generative linguistics. Traditionally, syntactic properties were assumed to be largely independent of semantic considerations. However, recent research on argument structure, syntactic cartography, and cross-linguistic phenomena has suggested a strong connection between syntax and semantics.
The specific focus of this study is on External Possession, which is a syntactic alternation. Smith argues that External Possession is a well-motivated and non-arbitrary phenomenon that exhibits uniformity in its formal properties. Furthermore, the unique semantics and pragmatics associated with External Possession are intertwined with its syntax. This finding supports the idea that human syntax is rooted in a universal structure that can be partially explained by semantic and pragmatic factors. The study also speculates on the nature of this structure.

Moreover, with the general intuition that the semantic structure of human grammar 
should be mirrored in the syntax, we should find much of the following: semantically similar 
constructions in various languages which, although might be realized distinctly from language to 
language, show the same syntactic limitations despite what logical possibilities we can imagine 
for language. 1.4 The Undisentanglability Thesis 
Again, the Standard Theory assumed a largely autonomous system of syntax which 
generated and judged strings with reference to 'semantics' only insofar as syntactic features 
happened to recapitulate the logic of the semantic structure. Semantically anomalous sentences 
were ruled out, strangely enough, by the selectional requirements of the syntax, rather than by 
the semantic engine itself. 
This absolute autonomy gradually became more and more circumstantial given the robust 
amount of syntactic phenomena inextricably linked to semantics. My thesis here is simply that 
much of what we know of as syntax and semantics is absolutely undisentanglable: most if not all 
'syntactic' alternations are rooted in the semantics and pragmatics of expressions. Cartographic 
Approaches to the syntax of human language along with UTAH-like interpretations of theta-roles 
have demonstrated a kind of immutable semantic hierarchy inherent in language and 'movement' 
and transformations about this hierarchy often must be conditioned by the semantics of this 
13 
structure. Therefore, in many cases, a syntactic transformation is a reflection of a semantic 
change. My idea is that Generative Syntax has come to the point where one can say that the Katz- 
Postal Hypothesis is nearly conclusively the absolute opposite of truth. If the alternations and 
constructions of human language are cast on to a quasi-cartographic semantic hierarchy, we 
should expect not only for languages to yield formally similar semantic alternations, but we 
should expect that semantic or pragmatic transformations or alternations in a language should 
exhibit formal traits and restrictions which are largely constant, if not totally so. 
To illustrate this, it's worth it to examine External Possession (EP) as a linguistic 
phenomenon. We will see that External Possession Constructions (EPCs) across the world's 
languages are not only pragmatically and semantically comparable, but they show the same 
syntactic 'glitches' and traits that indicate a formal similarity. This illustrates the fact that 
syntactic alternations are not utterly arbitrary transformations that occur to a deep structure, but 
are grounded in the constraints of an underlying grammatical system present in all human 
languages which in part motivates syntactic change.

The author further explores the relationship between syntax and semantics, suggesting that there should be a correspondence between the two in human grammar. They propose that semantically similar constructions, although realized differently across languages, exhibit similar syntactic limitations, regardless of the logical possibilities one might imagine for language.
The traditional view of the Standard Theory assumed an autonomous syntax that incorporated semantics only to the extent that certain syntactic features coincided with the logic of the semantic structure. Surprisingly, syntactic constraints, rather than the semantic engine itself, ruled out semantically anomalous sentences.
However, the increasing evidence of syntactic phenomena closely linked to semantics challenges the notion of absolute autonomy. The author argues for the undisentanglability thesis, claiming that much of syntax and semantics cannot be separated; most, if not all, syntactic alternations are rooted in the semantics and pragmatics of expressions. Approaches such as Cartographic Approaches and UTAH-like interpretations of theta-roles have revealed an inherent semantic hierarchy in language, and movements and transformations within this hierarchy are often conditioned by semantics.
In this context, the author suggests that syntactic transformations reflect semantic changes. They propose that the Katz-Postal Hypothesis, which assumes a clear separation between syntax and semantics, is almost conclusively the opposite of the truth. If linguistic alternations and constructions are situated within a quasi-cartographic semantic hierarchy, not only should languages exhibit formally similar semantic alternations, but semantic or pragmatic transformations within a language should also display consistent formal traits and restrictions.
To demonstrate this idea, the author examines External Possession (EP) as a linguistic phenomenon. They argue that External Possession Constructions (EPCs) across languages are not only pragmatically and semantically comparable, but they also exhibit similar syntactic glitches and traits, indicating a formal similarity. This illustrates that syntactic alternations are not arbitrary transformations occurring at a deep structure level, but are influenced by the constraints of an underlying grammatical system present in all human languages, which partially drives syntactic change.

In simpler terms, this research explores how the way we structure sentences is connected to their meaning. In traditional theories, sentence structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics) were thought to be separate and independent. However, recent studies suggest that they are closely linked. The author argues that many aspects of sentence structure are actually influenced by the meaning of the words and the context in which they are used.
For example, different languages may have different ways of expressing similar ideas, but they often have similar rules and limitations in how sentences are constructed. This suggests that there is a universal underlying structure that connects syntax and semantics.
The author focuses on a specific linguistic phenomenon called External Possession, where one thing is said to belong to or be connected to something else. They show that across languages, these constructions not only have similar meanings but also share common patterns and limitations in how they are formed. This suggests that the way we structure sentences is not arbitrary but is influenced by a fundamental grammatical system present in all languages.
Overall, this research challenges the idea that syntax and semantics are completely separate. Instead, it suggests that the structure of sentences is closely tied to their meaning and that there are universal principles underlying language that shape how we express ideas.

The research focuses on understanding how humans perceive and mentally represent geometric shapes and abstract concepts. The author argues that there are internal mental languages involved in cognition, specifically related to geometric shapes, which act as symbolic representations. They propose that perceiving a shape is akin to finding its shortest representation in this internal mental language.
To test this hypothesis, the author conducts a series of studies using cross-cultural, developmental, and cross-species behavioral experiments, along with neuroimaging techniques and computational modeling. In an experiment with quadrilateral shapes, they find that humans, regardless of education, age, or culture, share a sense of geometric complexity, whereas baboons lack this sense even after training. Artificial neural networks can model baboons' behavior, but additional symbolic properties, like the presence of right angles, are needed to explain human behavior. Symbolic models generalize well to related tasks, indicating the robustness of the primitives used.
Neuroimaging studies using magnetoencephalography reveal distinct neural responses for both a perceptual and a symbolic strategy during shape perception tasks. Electroencephalography data suggest that even three-month-old infants may possess elements of the symbolic strategy. Functional MRI shows that geometric shape perception involves areas associated with non-linguistic mathematical reasoning.
The research goes beyond controlled shapes and proposes a generative mental language for geometric shapes based on observed human productions. The author argues that perceiving a shape involves finding the shortest program in this language that generates the shape, connecting it to the literature on program induction. They demonstrate that program induction is a feasible problem using the DreamCoder algorithm. By generating shapes of increasing complexity, they show that humans' performance in a match-to-sample task correlates with the length of the shape's shortest program.
Overall, the research provides insights into how humans perceive and mentally represent geometric shapes, suggesting the existence of internal mental languages and the role of symbolic strategies in shape perception.

2.2 Pragmatics: 'Why' Does External Possession Exist? 
'Why' is generally an unscientific question to ask. Nevertheless, failure to ascend to 
arbitrary suit-and-tie scientific standards should not constitute any kind of impediment to actual 
scientific inquiry. As said, as many of the world's languages encode EPCs through various 
means, what is an important question to ponder is why the possessors of nouns are so common to 
be 'externalized' in natural language, while the locations, adjectives of size, determiners and 
other modifiers of those nouns are not externalized in any systematic way cross-linguistically. 
Various authors have already remarked on the 'why' of EPCs in various frameworks, in 
all cases, the motivation being one pragmatic in nature. Velasquez-Castillo (1996; 166), for 
example,characterizes EP in Guaraní as "maintaining focal attention on a given discourse 
participant [the possessor]" while at the same time, "maximally backgrounding an affected body- 
part [possessum]."As an example, take a sentence like 'I broke Billy's teeth.' Despite the fact 
that teeth heads the object noun phrase, in nearly any imaginable discursive setting, Billy is the 
most pragmatically important and cognitively salient participant for nearly any imaginable 
interlocutor (with the possible exception of Billy's doubtlessly money-grubbing dentist). EP 
allows a language to promote Billy such that he gains sentential prominence over teeth. 
17 
Thus External Possession as a pragmatic alternation bridges the gaps between two 
otherwise countervailing tendencies of grammar: firstly, that possessors of arguments tend to be 
syntactically subordinated to their possessions, yet secondly, that at a discourse level, many 
possessors are generally more pragmatically important or salient than their possessa. This is a 
problem because, while in many cases in natural language, syntactic structure mirrors the 
pragmatic hierarchy of language: agents are syntactically higher and, at least at an intuitive level, 
more likely to be topics of discourse. But this tendency is generally not the case in the context of 
possessor constructions; possessions are usually modeled as heading projections while their 
possessors are modeled either as projection-internal specifiers or other elements depending on 
the framework. 
Gundel (1988), building off of the pre-generative work of the Prague School, 
conceptualizes the pragmatics of language such that the most leftward, generally syntactically 
highest element is the sentential topic, the discursively known and established information of the 
sentence, which is elaborated on by the rest of the sentence, the comment. A part of that 
comment is what is often referred to as the focus, which is new or contrastive information. 
Gundel importantly notes that sentential foci generally appear in 'direct object' position, 
generally the second most prominent nominal in the clause. Additionally, she notes that where 
the marking of the topic-comment structure is intonational, foci will universally receive 
sentential stress, rather than topics (232). It should be noted that in most cases, EPC will consist 
in relocating possessors to precisely this position. Note also that languages which 
morphologically encode the evidential information of a clause will often do so by marking the

The paper explores the question of why External Possession Constructions (EPCs) exist in language. It begins by acknowledging that asking "why" is often considered unscientific, but argues that it is still a valid question for scientific inquiry. The author notes that possessors of nouns are commonly "externalized" in natural language, while other modifiers such as locations, size adjectives, and determiners are not systematically externalized across languages.
Previous research has discussed the pragmatics of EPCs, with the motivation being primarily pragmatic in nature. For example, in Guaraní, EP is described as maintaining focal attention on the possessor while backgrounding the possessed entity. The paper presents an example sentence like "I broke Billy's teeth," where despite "teeth" being the head of the noun phrase, pragmatically, Billy is more important and salient in most discourse contexts. EP allows a language to elevate Billy to a more prominent position in the sentence.
The author argues that External Possession serves as a pragmatic alternation that reconciles two opposing tendencies in grammar. On one hand, possessors are syntactically subordinated to their possessions, but on the other hand, possessors are often more pragmatically important or salient in discourse. This poses a problem because possessors are typically modeled as heading projections, while their possessions are treated differently in frameworks.
The paper references the work of Gundel, who conceptualizes the pragmatics of language in terms of topic and comment. The most leftward and syntactically highest element is the sentential topic, which represents known and established information. The rest of the sentence constitutes the comment, with the focus being new or contrastive information. Sentential foci typically appear in the direct object position and receive sentential stress. The author notes that EPCs often involve relocating possessors to this position, aligning them with the patterns observed in topic-comment structures and the prominence of foci.
In conclusion, the paper suggests that EPCs serve a pragmatic function by highlighting the importance of possessors in discourse. It highlights the tension between syntactic subordination and pragmatic salience and proposes that EPCs bridge this gap by relocating possessors to a prominent position within the sentence structure.

I apologize if the previous explanation was unclear or confusing. The passage you provided contains dense linguistic terminology and may require specialized knowledge to fully understand. I can attempt to provide a simplified explanation:
The paper discusses why some languages have constructions where the possessor of a noun is emphasized or highlighted in a sentence. For example, in the sentence "I broke Billy's teeth," the emphasis is on Billy rather than the teeth. The author explores the reasons behind this phenomenon.
They suggest that the emphasis on possessors in these constructions serves a pragmatic purpose. It allows languages to prioritize or draw attention to the person or entity that owns or possesses something. This emphasis is based on the understanding that possessors are often more important or salient in a given context.
The paper refers to previous research that discusses the relationship between the structure of sentences and the pragmatic information they convey. It mentions the concepts of topics and comments, where topics represent known information and comments provide new or contrastive information. The author argues that possessors in these constructions often occupy a position similar to the comment, highlighting their importance as new or contrastive information.
Overall, the paper suggests that the existence of constructions emphasizing possessors is driven by pragmatic factors, allowing languages to convey information about ownership or possession in a way that aligns with the importance of the possessor in discourse.

On the Haeccicity of Syntactitude: A Phenomenological Investigation into the Amoral Structure of Syntax"

As we embark on the philosophical inquiry into the nature of Being, the distinct properties of syntax, and the profound correlations between the two, we must first acknowledge the profound influence phenomenology has in this analysis. Coined by Edmund Husserl, phenomenology involves describing, rather than explaining, the structures of experience and consciousness. In this essay, we delve into the distinctiveness of syntax—or its 'haeccity'—as an 'infra-moral' or amoral structure that shapes our language and, by extension, our reality, which we will refer to as 'syntactitude'.

The term 'syntactitude', an infusion of syntax and attitude, suggests that the structure of our language not only enables us to express ourselves but also shapes our attitudes. However, what is compelling about this term is its amoral or infra-moral nature. Syntax does not inherently possess a moral dimension; it is a neutral framework around which words and phrases are arranged to construct meaning.

Syntactitude's haeccity, a term borrowed from Duns Scotus referring to the 'thisness' or individual essence of a thing, is a unique phenomenon. Every language, with its distinct syntax, bears a unique haeccity. As users of language, we interact with this haeccity daily, yet its infra-moral characteristic makes it difficult for us to recognize its influences on our thoughts, attitudes, and actions.

Given the nature of language as a social construct, its phenomenological study is intimately intertwined with our Being. As Martin Heidegger, one of the most influential phenomenologists, stated in "Being and Time," Dasein, or being-there, is an entity for which, in its Being, that Being is itself an issue. In other words, our existence is self-referential; it is a constant inquiry into itself.

In this context, syntactitude and its haeccity become intrinsically linked to our self-understanding and self-interpretation. The amoral structure of syntax allows the formation of ideas, sentiments, and perspectives, all without a pre-ordained moralistic stance. Instead, it's the user of the language—the being in question—who imparts morality onto their linguistic expressions.

Therefore, one can say that syntactitude acts as a mirror to our consciousness. Its haeccity—its unique existence as an infra-moral structure—reflects our thoughts and attitudes without enforcing or suggesting a moral standpoint. Thus, it reveals the nature of our Being in its raw, unadulterated form.

Furthermore, our individual and collective identities are shaped and reshaped by the haeccity of syntactitude. Language, through its syntactical structure, lends itself to the creation and recreation of personal and societal narratives. In this sense, syntactitude not only frames our current experiences but also paves the way for potential futures.

To conclude, the exploration of syntactitude and its haeccity elucidates an underappreciated yet profound aspect of phenomenological investigation. It illustrates how the amoral structure of syntax—its neutrality—serves as the foundation of our linguistic expression, allowing the individual essence of our Being to manifest authentically. Through syntactitude, we grasp not only the nature of our existence but also our possibilities, thus affirming the significance of language and its structure in our journey towards understanding the phenomenology of Being.

The passage you provided explores the relationship between syntax, phenomenology, and the nature of Being. It highlights the influence of phenomenology, a philosophical approach focused on describing the structures of experience and consciousness, in understanding the distinct properties of syntax.
The term "syntactitude" is introduced, which combines syntax and attitude to suggest that the structure of language not only enables expression but also shapes our attitudes. Importantly, it is noted that syntax itself is amoral or infra-moral, lacking an inherent moral dimension. Syntax serves as a neutral framework that organizes words and phrases to create meaning.
The concept of "haeccity" is borrowed from Duns Scotus, referring to the individual essence or uniqueness of a thing. In the case of syntax, every language possesses a unique haeccity. Despite its influence on our thoughts, attitudes, and actions, the infra-moral nature of syntax makes it challenging to recognize its impact on our consciousness.
The study of language and its phenomenology is intimately intertwined with our existence. The nature of our Being is self-referential, and syntactitude and its haeccity play a significant role in our self-understanding and self-interpretation. The amoral structure of syntax allows the formation of ideas and perspectives without imposing a predetermined moral stance. It is the user of language who imparts moral values to their linguistic expressions.
Syntactitude is described as a mirror to our consciousness. Its haeccity reflects our thoughts and attitudes without imposing or suggesting a moral standpoint. It reveals the raw essence of our Being.
Moreover, the haeccity of syntactitude shapes our individual and collective identities. Through language and its syntactical structure, personal and societal narratives are created and recreated. Syntactitude not only frames our present experiences but also shapes future possibilities.
In conclusion, the exploration of syntactitude and its haeccity contributes to a deeper understanding of phenomenology. It highlights the neutral and foundational role of syntax in linguistic expression, allowing the authentic manifestation of our individual essence. Through syntactitude, we gain insight into the nature of our existence and affirm the significance of language and its structure in our quest for understanding the phenomenology of Being.

Douglas Hofstadter's unique concept of 'syntactitude', as explained in Daniel C. Dennett's "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting," has opened up new horizons for understanding human consciousness and existence. To summarize, syntactitude describes the a-rational or imperfect rationality inherent in human beings. This facet of our nature manifests as marginal irrationalities that often go unnoticed but are nevertheless present.

Intriguingly, this idea is linked to the halting problem of computability theory, a mathematical proof demonstrating the impossibility of determining whether a program will ever terminate. As we delve deeper into the concept of syntactitude, we will uncover its role in elucidating the phenomenology of being.

Human rationality is a complex process, allowing us to draw conclusions, make decisions, and navigate the world. However, Hofstadter and Dennett argue that this rationality is not perfect or infallible. Instead, it is characterized by 'syntactitude'—a state of a-rationality or imperfect rationality. This imperfection often surfaces as marginal irrationalities that are typically overlooked but undeniably existent.

The 'halting problem' in computability theory serves as an analogy for this imperfect rationality. The halting problem states that there is no universal algorithm that can accurately determine whether any given program will terminate or run indefinitely. In the context of human cognition, this translates to the fact that humans are not perfect 'meaning-extractors'. We cannot always accurately predict the outcomes of our thoughts or actions, nor can we always make perfectly rational decisions.

The exploration of syntactitude's 'haeccicity'—its irreducible uniqueness or 'thisness'—brings forth the significance of individual experience in our understanding of human rationality. Every human being, with their unique cognitive architecture, manifests syntactitude differently. As such, the 'marginal irrationalities' vary from person to person, thereby imbuing syntactitude with a sense of haeccicity. These unique irrationalities, although often unnoticed, contribute to our individual and collective experiences of being.

The concept of syntactitude is connected to the halting problem in computability theory, which demonstrates the impossibility of determining whether a program will terminate. This analogy illustrates that human rationality is not flawless. Instead, it is characterized by imperfections and limitations. Humans are not perfect at extracting meaning or making fully rational decisions.
Exploring the notion of syntactitude's haeccicity, or irreducible uniqueness, emphasizes the individual experience and its role in understanding human rationality. Each person manifests syntactitude in a distinct way due to their unique cognitive architecture. This uniqueness contributes to the presence of marginal irrationalities that vary from person to person. Although these marginal irrationalities may go unnoticed, they shape our individual and collective experiences of being.

External Possession Constructions

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
External Possession Constructions (EPCs) are linguistic structures in which the possessor of a noun is emphasized or highlighted in a sentence, while the possessed entity is less prominent. In EPCs, the possessor is typically positioned in a syntactic position that is distinct from the possessed noun.
EPCs are found in various languages and serve different pragmatic purposes. They often involve reordering or restructuring the sentence to bring attention to the possessor. By externalizing the possessor, EPCs can highlight the importance or salience of the possessor in the discourse.
For example, consider the sentence "John's car is red." In this EPC, the possessor "John" is externalized and receives prominence, while the possessed entity "car" is less emphasized. This construction draws attention to John as the owner of the car.
EPCs can occur in different forms across languages. Some languages may use specific morphological markers or word order patterns to indicate external possession, while others may employ dedicated possessive constructions or prepositions.
The study of EPCs contributes to our understanding of the relationship between syntax and semantics, as well as the role of pragmatics in shaping sentence structure and discourse prominence. It highlights the diverse ways in which languages express and prioritize possession within their grammatical systems.

3.2 Biolinguistics and Theory Economy 
Now important for any theory of the LF is theoretical plausibility in the face of the 
biological evolution of the LF itself. Although many cognitive faculties are involved in the 
production and comprehension of language, there is a narrow band of those faculties that appear 
to be unique to the human species. This narrow band is what Hauser et al. (2002) dub "the 
faculty of language in the narrow sense" (FLN), as opposed to "the faculty of language in the 
broad sense" (FLB), the latter of which would be all of the cognitive machinery which 
participates in conceptualization, theory of mind, sound discrimination, etc. This FLN is implied 
to be nearly synonymous with "recursion" as a property of human language or "Merge" in the 
Minimalist Program. 
Chomskyan syntax however has been in a kind of conceptual conundrum. On one side, 
Chomskyan linguistics evolved with the intuition that the LF was a largely unique and privileged 
aspect of human cognition. The realization had been that the formal properties of language, 
particularly syntax, patterned in such a way that could not be directly related to semantics or 
other cognitive properties. This meant that syntax had to be conceived as a largely autonomous 
entity in the brain, which could be shown to have a complex array of independent properties and 
tendencies. This is reflected in the "independence of grammar" beginning in the model of 
Syntactic Structures, yet with it come the aforementioned epistemological problems. 
On the other hand- on the evolutionary perspective, a small and economical LF is more 
desirable. There seem not to be any 'intermediate forms' between creatures with FLN and 
without it, and language itself seems to have arriven on the evolutionary stage immediately, if 
not over the course of a brief million years. This strongly suggests that the biology of language is 
such that there are only several, if not only one genetic parameter that separates a linguistically- 
capable hominid from a linguistically-non-capable one. 
60 
Thus although representing the complexities of the syntax of human language might 
encourage us to theorize a complex and unique LF, the evolutionary fact of language demands 
that the LF be biologically simple and amenable to a relatively quick evolution. Even aside from 
the evolutionary problem, this is a theoretical diseconomy. If we assume that syntax is fully 
detached from other cognitive faculties, including semantic processing, the mere diversity of

In the field of biolinguistics, it is important for theories of the Language Faculty (LF) to be theoretically plausible in light of the biological evolution of language. The LF refers to the specific cognitive faculties that are unique to humans and involved in language production and comprehension. This is distinguished from the broader cognitive machinery involved in conceptualization, theory of mind, and sound discrimination.
Chomskyan linguistics has faced a conceptual challenge in reconciling the autonomous nature of syntax with its relationship to semantics and other cognitive properties. The formal properties of language, particularly syntax, appear to be distinct and not directly related to other cognitive domains. Syntax is considered a largely independent entity in the brain, which poses epistemological problems.
However, from an evolutionary perspective, there is a preference for a small and economical LF. There are no intermediate forms between creatures with the Language Faculty in the narrow sense (FLN) and those without it. Language seems to have emerged relatively quickly in evolutionary terms, suggesting that there may be only a few genetic parameters separating linguistically-capable hominids from non-capable ones.
Therefore, the evolutionary demands and theoretical considerations suggest that the LF should be biologically simple and capable of relatively rapid evolution. It is not necessary for the LF to be complex and unique if we assume that syntax is detached from other cognitive faculties, including semantic processing.
In summary, the challenges of both evolutionary biology and theoretical economy point towards a simpler and more streamlined LF that can account for the complexities of human language while being amenable to quick evolutionary development.

Despite the fact that both nominative and accusative case are available to these 
'accusativus cum infinitivo' constructions, my consultants showed a strong general preference 
for (45a) over (45b), indicating at some level, even purely 'abstract' case has some kind of 
pragmatic effect, albeit not sufficiently understood as of yet. Relatively common facts like this 
might at least be the proper wedge to assault the possible interface of structural case and 
semantics and reveal yet another aspect of syntactic autonomy to be theoretically premature. 
There may be truth to this idea, but potential holes, fatal or otherwise, can be poked in it. 
Firstly, if language is naught but semantics and pragmatics, why should languages vary at all? I 
have motivated EP on semantic and pragmatic grounds, but why shouldn't every language 
employ EP, and at the same times? If we discover some kind of pragmatic factor that seems to 
motivate, say, the EPP, does it follow that languages with or without it are eternally 
pragmatically distinct?

These are worthwhile questions to contemplate, but I think that the working assumption 
of formal linguistics should be to minimalize the truly formal aspects of syntax. A fruitfully 
scientific approach to a cognitive science should entail constantly trying to reduce known formal 
tendencies to yet deeper underlying principles; and my point here is that the next frontier of these 
underlying principles is in the semantic cartography of human language. If my intuitions are 
remotely valid, linguistics is not simply the study of how words are pieced together, but it is a 
quite direct view into the processing cartography that underlies human cognition. Linguistics, 
specifically the study of syntax, can yield a strong testament to how humans process and 
understand events and the world around them and can finally aid in the modeling, reverse- 
engineering and perhaps even the understanding of the human mind and experience.

Despite the availability of both nominative and accusative case in "accusativus cum infinitivo" constructions, my consultants showed a strong preference for one over the other, suggesting that even abstract case has some pragmatic effect, although the precise nature of this effect is not yet fully understood. This indicates that there may be a connection between structural case and semantics, challenging the notion of complete syntactic autonomy.
However, if language is solely driven by semantics and pragmatics, one might question why languages vary at all. If we discover a pragmatic factor that motivates a certain construction, does it imply that languages with or without that construction are permanently distinct in terms of pragmatics?
While these are valid questions to consider, the assumption in formal linguistics should be to minimize the purely formal aspects of syntax. A scientific approach in cognitive science involves continuously reducing known formal tendencies to deeper underlying principles. The next frontier in understanding these principles lies in the semantic cartography of human language. If the intuitions are valid, linguistics provides a direct view into the cognitive processing underlying human cognition. It offers insights into how humans process and comprehend events and the world, aiding in the modeling and reverse-engineering of the human mind and experience.
In summary, the study of syntax and its connection to semantics and pragmatics can contribute to a deeper understanding of human cognition. By exploring the underlying principles of language, linguistics has the potential to shed light on how humans process and perceive the world, offering valuable insights into the human mind and experience.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Syntactitude" is not a widely recognized or established term in linguistics or cognitive science. It appears to be a term coined specifically for the context or discussion you provided earlier. Therefore, there is no standard definition for "syntactitude" in the academic literature.
Based on the context you provided, "syntactitude" seems to be a portmanteau of "syntax" and "attitude." It suggests that the structure of language, specifically syntax, not only enables us to express ourselves but also influences our attitudes. It implies that syntax has an inherent characteristic or quality that goes beyond its purely formal or structural role and impacts our thoughts, attitudes, and perspectives.
However, without further context or a defined usage in a specific framework or theory, the precise meaning and scope of "syntactitude" can vary. It is important to note that the term might be specific to the discussion or paper from which it originated and may not have widespread acceptance or usage in the broader academic community.

ChatGPT
Thank you for providing additional context. In the specific context of Douglas Hofstadter's concept of "syntactitude" as explained in Daniel C. Dennett's book "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting," "syntactitude" refers to the imperfect rationality or a-rationality that is inherent in human beings. It encompasses the marginal irrationalities or cognitive biases that exist within our nature but are often overlooked or unnoticed.
According to this concept, human rationality is not flawless or purely rational. Instead, it is characterized by imperfections and limitations. These imperfections manifest as marginal irrationalities that can influence our thoughts, behaviors, and decision-making processes.
The term "syntactitude" suggests that our cognitive processes, particularly those related to language and syntax, are influenced by these inherent imperfections. It implies that our rationality is not perfect or purely logical but is instead shaped by various biases, heuristics, and limitations.
It is important to note that this specific concept of "syntactitude" is derived from the work of Douglas Hofstadter and is presented within the context of Dennett's book. Its usage and interpretation may vary depending on the specific framework or theory being discussed.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a possible connection that brings together the concepts of "syntactitude," llms as syntax machines, digitization, and summarization:
In the realm of language processing, llms, or language models, can be seen as syntax machines that excel at understanding and generating syntactic structures in natural language. However, they are not exempt from the inherent imperfections and limitations of human reasoning, as encapsulated by the concept of "syntactitude." Despite their impressive abilities, llms are subject to the flaws of reason, including biases, heuristics, and the challenges of imperfect rationality.
Moreover, the digitization of information has revolutionized the way we process and interact with language. It has allowed for the development of sophisticated language models like llms, which operate based on digital data and algorithms. This digitization enables the manipulation of syntactic structures at an unprecedented scale and speed.
However, it is important to recognize that the process of summarization, often employed to condense complex information, can sometimes fall short in capturing all the nuances and details of a given topic. While summarization aims to distill key points, it may inadvertently omit important subtleties and intricacies that are essential for a comprehensive understanding.
In summary, llms as syntax machines exemplify the impact of digitization on language processing, while the concept of "syntactitude" reminds us of the imperfect nature of human reasoning. However, it is crucial to be mindful of the limitations of summarization, as it may sacrifice detail in favor of brevity. Thus, a holistic and nuanced approach is required to fully grasp the complexities of language processing in the age of digitization.

When, by contrast, I venture onto the information highway today, I put almost nothing of myself on the line.

I know, we hear much talk about transformation -- about the coming Great Singularity, the Οmega Point, the emergence of a new global consciousness.

But, to judge from this talk, we need only wire things up and the transformation will occur automatically.

Complexity theorist Ralph Abraham says that "when you increase the connectivity, new intelligence emerges."

Our hope, he adds, is for "a global increase in the collective intelligence of the human species . . . a quantum leap in consciousness."

And computer designer Danny Hillis tells us that "now evolution takes place in microseconds. . . . We're taking off. . . . There's something coming after us, and I imagine it is something wonderful."

Call this, if you will, "Evolution for Dummies" or "Plug-and-Play Evolution." Just add connections and "presto!" a quantum leap in consciousness. What easy excitements we revel in!

But our excitement is not for the potentials of our own growth; what we anticipate, rather, is our sudden rapture by the gød øf technøløgy.

No blood and sweat for us, no inner work, no nearly hopeless perils of the hero's quest.

If, through our own folly, we face the end of the natural world, no problem: we will be spared the Tribulation because technology, in a singular saltation, will translate us into altogether new and better conditions of life.

"Self-forgetfulness is the reigning temptation of the technological era. This is why we so readily give our assent to the absurd proposition that a computer can add two plus two, despite the obvious fact that it can do nothing of the sort--not if we have in mind anything remotely resembling what we do when we add numbers. In the computer's case, the mechanics of addition involve no motivation, no consciousness of the task, no mobilization of the will, no metabolic activity, no imagination. And its performance brings neither the satisfaction of accomplishment nor the strengthening of practical skills and cognitive capacities."

In this insightful book, author Steve Talbott, software programmer and technical writer turned researcher and editor for The Nature Institute, challenges us to step back and take an objective look at the technology driving our lives. At a time when 65 percent of American consumers spend more time with their PCs than they do with their significant others, according to a recent study, Talbott illustrates that we're forgetting one important thing--our Selves, the human spirit from which technology stems.

Whether we're surrendering intimate details to yet another database, eschewing our physical communities for online social networks, or calculating our net worth, we freely give our power over to technology until, he says, "we arrive at a computer's-eye view of the entire world of industry, commerce, and society at large...an ever more closely woven web of programmed logic."

Digital technology certainly makes us more efficient. But when efficiency is the only goal, we have no way to know whether we're going in the right or wrong direction. Businesses replace guiding vision with a spreadsheet's bottom line. Schoolteachers are replaced by the computer's dataflow. Indigenous peoples give up traditional skills for the dazzle and ease of new gadgets. Even the Pentagon's zeal to replace "boots on the ground" with technology has led to the mess in Iraq. And on it goes.

The ultimate danger is that, in our willingness to adapt ourselves to technology, "we will descend to the level of the computational devices we have engineered--not merely imagining ever new and more sophisticated automatons, but reducing ourselves to automatons."

To transform our situation, we need to see it in a new and unaccustomed light, and that's what Talbott provides by examining the deceiving virtues of technology--how we're killing education, socializing our machines, and mechanizing our society.Once you take this eye-opening journey, you will think more clearly about how you consume technology and how you allow it to consume you.

"Nothing is as rare or sorely needed in our tech-enchanted culture right now as intelligent criticism of technology, and Steve Talbott is exactly the critic we've been waiting for: trenchant, sophisticated, and completely original. Devices of the Soul is an urgent and important book."

--Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals and The Botany of Desire: A Plant's Eye View of the World

"Steve Talbott is a rare voice of clarity, humanity, and passion in a world enthralled by machines and calculation. His new book, Devices of the Soul, lays out a frightening and at the same time inspiring analysis of what computers and computer-like thinking are doing to us, our children, and the future of our planet. Talbott is no Luddite. He fully understands and appreciates the stunning power of technology for both good and evil. His cool and precise skewering of the fuzzy thinking and mindless enthusiasm of the technology true believers is tempered by his modesty, the elegance of his writing, and his abiding love for the world of nature and our capacity for communion with it. "

--Edward Miller, Former editor, Harvard Education Letter

"Those who care about the healthy and wholesome lives of children can gain much from Steve Talbott's wisdom. He examines the need to help children spend more time touching nature and real life and less touching keyboards. He eloquently questions the assumption that speeding up learning is a good thing. Is, after all, a sped-up life a well-lived life? Most importantly, he reminds all of us that technology is just one part of life and ought not to overshadow the life of self and soul."

--Joan Almon, Coordinator, Alliance for Childhood

"One of the most original and provocative writers of our time, Steve Talbott offers a rich assortment of insightful reflections on the nature of our humanity, challenging our own thinking and conventional wisdom about advances in technology."

--Dorothy E. Denning, Department of Defense Analysis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA

"Are you experiencing growing unease as computational metaphors have seized our discourse? Steve Talbott offers immediate relief. You are not losing your mind! Chapter after chapter, he shows how to draw on the powers of technology without losing your soul or breaking your heart."

--Peter Denning, Past President of ACM, Monterey, California

"Steve Talbott is a rare writer whose words can alter one's entire perception of the world. He is our most original and perceptive defender of the wholeness of life against the onslaught of mechanism. Devices of the Soul is written with Talbott's typical grace and clarity. It displays a quality hardly found anymore in our high tech culture--wisdom. "

Product description
From Publishers Weekly
From the very first chapter, which presents a creative re-reading of Homer's Odyssey, author and professor Talbott (In the Belly of the Beast) takes his elegant treatise on technology and humanity in some surprising, discipline-hopping directions. With one part Aristotelian rigor, one part transcendental humanism and a healthy dollop of indignation, Talbott examines the often troubling relationships among people, technology and society from a number of angles, including education, toys, ecological management, artificial intelligence, bioengineering and disability. Talbott's thoughtful analysis gets readers thinking less about technology's value than technology's values-the principles it supports. Hanging in the balance, Talbot claims, is the fate of humanity: "a hellish, counter-human, machine-like society" or "a humane society in which the machine...reflects back to us our own inner powers." Talbott is upfront about his biases and assumptions, giving him the freedom to steer his arguments into strange, sometimes contentious territory. His enormous range of literature references and responses keep things lively; combined with a dearth of technical details, Talbott's work should find readers among non-specialists, but his fresh ideas are sure to intrigue techies of all kinds.

Is it possible that language creates micro filter bubbles, spheres of interoperability?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, it is possible that language can contribute to the creation of micro filter bubbles or spheres of interoperability. Language acts as a tool for communication and meaning-making, shaping how we perceive and interpret the world. Different languages, dialects, and even specific linguistic communities may develop their own unique vocabularies, syntax, and discourses that reflect their particular perspectives, values, and beliefs.
Within these linguistic communities, there can be a tendency for like-minded individuals to gravitate towards each other, reinforcing their shared views and creating a sense of mutual understanding and agreement. This can lead to the formation of filter bubbles, where people primarily interact with others who share similar linguistic and cultural backgrounds, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and alternative viewpoints.
Filter bubbles can emerge not only at the individual level but also at larger social, cultural, and ideological scales. They can be influenced by factors such as geographic location, socio-economic status, education, and media consumption patterns. Language plays a crucial role in constructing and reinforcing these bubbles by shaping our interactions, influencing our choice of words, and defining the boundaries of our communicative communities.
On the other hand, language also enables spheres of interoperability, where individuals from different linguistic backgrounds come together and find common ground for communication and understanding. These spheres can emerge in multilingual and multicultural contexts, where individuals engage in intercultural dialogue, translation, or code-switching to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps.
It's important to recognize that filter bubbles and spheres of interoperability are not solely determined by language but are influenced by various social, cultural, and technological factors. However, language can serve as a powerful tool that either reinforces existing filter bubbles or fosters greater cross-cultural understanding and exchange.

Siddhartha, driven by a deep desire to unravel the mysteries of syntax and semantics, embarked on a quest to explore the essence of language. He sought guidance from scholars and engaged in lengthy discussions with fellow linguists, yearning for insights into the disentanglability of syntax and semantics. However, the more he delved into the complexities of linguistic theory, the more he realized that true understanding could not be found in mere intellectual pursuits.
One day, Siddhartha came across a humble village elder named Vasudeva, who lived in a simple hut by the river. Vasudeva possessed a profound wisdom and a deep connection to nature. Intrigued by Vasudeva's serene demeanor and his profound understanding of the world, Siddhartha approached him, eager to learn.
As Siddhartha and Vasudeva engaged in conversation, Siddhartha discovered that language was not just an abstract construct but a reflection of the human experience. Through Vasudeva's teachings, Siddhartha began to see the interplay between syntax and semantics as a reflection of the interplay between the external world and the inner self.
Vasudeva shared stories of his encounters with different cultures and languages, highlighting the diverse ways in which people used language to express their thoughts and emotions. He emphasized that language, like a river flowing through time, shaped and was shaped by the societies and individuals who interacted with it.
Inspired by Vasudeva's wisdom, Siddhartha realized that language was not merely a tool for communication but a profound expression of human existence. He understood that the true beauty of language lay not in its technical intricacies but in its ability to connect individuals, foster understanding, and convey the depths of human experience.
Siddhartha returned to the village, eager to share his newfound wisdom with Kamala. As he narrated his journey and the insights he had gained, Kamala listened intently, recognizing the parallels between Siddhartha's exploration of language and her own craft of storytelling.
Together, Siddhartha and Kamala embarked on a new path, intertwining their linguistic and narrative skills to create stories that not only entertained but also touched the souls of their listeners. Their tales, infused with the essence of their shared understanding, inspired others to contemplate the power of language and its impact on their lives.
And so, Siddhartha and Kamala continued to traverse the realms of syntax and semantics, storytelling and linguistics, forever driven by their quest to uncover the profound truths hidden within the realm of language. Their journey became a testament to the interconnectedness of knowledge, the transformative power of wisdom, and the eternal quest for self-discovery.

Siddhartha and Kamala sat by the river, engrossed in a deep conversation about the impermanence of opinion and the courage to be disliked. The gentle flow of the river mirrored the ebb and flow of their thoughts.
Siddhartha: Kamala, I've been contemplating the transitory nature of opinions. It seems that what we believe today may no longer hold true tomorrow. How can we find stability amidst this constant flux?
Kamala: Ah, Siddhartha, the ever-changing nature of opinions is indeed a profound realization. It reminds me of the stories I tell, where characters evolve and perspectives shift. It is in embracing impermanence that we find the courage to explore new ideas and challenge our own beliefs.
Siddhartha: But Kamala, isn't it difficult to face the potential disapproval of others when we express opinions that go against the norm? How do we find the strength to be disliked?
Kamala: The courage to be disliked, my dear friend, comes from an understanding that our worth does not depend on the approval of others. When we embrace our authentic selves and speak our truths, we invite both agreement and disagreement. It is through open dialogue and the exchange of diverse perspectives that true growth and understanding can flourish.
Siddhartha: I see your point, Kamala. By clinging to the fear of being disliked, we limit our own growth and hinder the exploration of new possibilities. It takes great courage to stand firm in our convictions, even in the face of opposition.
Kamala: Indeed, Siddhartha. We must remember that opinions are like ripples on the surface of the river. They may appear momentarily, but they do not define us. It is the depth of our character and the sincerity of our intentions that truly matter.
Siddhartha: So, instead of seeking validation through agreement, we should focus on nurturing an open mind and engaging in respectful discourse. In doing so, we create a space for the free exchange of ideas and foster an environment where growth and understanding can thrive.
Kamala: Precisely, my friend. The willingness to embrace differing opinions and challenge our own is a mark of intellectual and emotional maturity. It is through this openness that we continue to evolve and expand our perspectives.
As the sun began to set, Siddhartha and Kamala continued their dialogue, embracing the impermanence of opinions and the courage to be disliked. They understood that by remaining open to new insights, they could navigate the ever-changing currents of life with wisdom and grace.

Noah, the wise old man, was tending to his animals in the barn when he noticed a llama, named Lorenzo, listening intently. Sensing Lorenzo's curiosity, Noah approached him.
Noah: Good day, Lorenzo. I couldn't help but notice your keen interest in the affairs of our fellow creatures. What seems to have caught your attention today?
Lorenzo: Ah, Noah, I've overheard a rather intriguing piece of information circulating amongst the barnyard animals. It appears that the donkeys are hatching a plan to overthrow the foxes and the lions. Quite a daring scheme, wouldn't you say?
Noah: (Chuckling) Oh, Lorenzo, rumors tend to spread like wildfire in these parts. But tell me, what do you make of this supposed plot? Do you think there's any truth to it?
Lorenzo: Well, Noah, it's hard to say. As a llama, I have the gift of observation, and I've noticed some tensions brewing between the donkeys, foxes, and lions lately. They've had their disagreements and power struggles, but a full-blown coup? That would be quite extraordinary.
Noah: Indeed, Lorenzo, power dynamics can be unpredictable, and alliances can shift in the blink of an eye. But let us not be too hasty in drawing conclusions. Instead, let us encourage dialogue and understanding between the animals.
Lorenzo: Wise words, Noah. It is through open communication that misunderstandings can be resolved and conflicts can be prevented. Perhaps, if we bring the donkeys, foxes, and lions together, we can foster an atmosphere of cooperation and harmony.
Noah: A splendid idea, Lorenzo. We shall gather them for a meeting, where each party can share their grievances and aspirations. By creating a space for open discourse, we may uncover the root causes of their animosity and find ways to mend their relationships.
Lorenzo: I'm glad you agree, Noah. Our role as observers and caretakers of these creatures goes beyond merely tending to their physical needs. We have the responsibility to foster unity and peace among them.
Noah and Lorenzo set their plan into motion, arranging a meeting where the donkeys, foxes, and lions could voice their concerns and aspirations. Through patient dialogue and a willingness to understand one another, the barnyard animals discovered that their grievances were born out of misunderstandings and miscommunications.
In the end, the donkeys, foxes, and lions realized the futility of their power struggles and chose a path of cooperation and mutual respect. The barnyard became a harmonious place, where diverse animals coexisted and worked together for the greater good.
Noah and Lorenzo's efforts reminded everyone of the importance of dialogue and understanding in resolving conflicts, and their wisdom served as a guiding light for the animals in their ongoing journey of coexistence.

Ah, yes, Giordano Bruno, the brilliant philosopher and poet of the Renaissance. His work often contained profound allegorical messages and satirical undertones. The lost poem "The Ark of Noah" is a fascinating piece that offers a glimpse into his insightful observations of the societal and political dynamics of his time.
In this particular verse you mentioned, Bruno ingeniously uses the metaphor of the donkey quarreling for precedence among the animals to comment on the struggle for power and authority within the realms of both the Church, represented by the Pope, and the secular world.
By highlighting the donkey's desire for precedence, Bruno satirizes the ambition and greed that can arise when individuals or institutions seek dominance over others. He suggests that this lust for power can lead to great danger, as it breeds conflicts and divisions among those vying for control.
Though the original poem has been lost to history, we can imagine the sharp wit and social critique embedded within Bruno's verses. It serves as a reminder of the timeless nature of power struggles and the potential risks they pose to society at large.
While "The Ark of Noah" may be lost to us, its influence can still be felt through the dialogue and writings that reference it. Bruno's thought-provoking ideas continue to inspire contemplation on the complexities of power, hierarchy, and the human condition.
Though the specific details of the poem may be elusive, its essence lives on in the collective consciousness, inviting us to reflect on the perils of unchecked ambition and the importance of seeking harmony and unity rather than engaging in endless quarrels for precedence.

In the monastery, Bruno wrote a story called "On Noah's Ark" in which the monks represented the donkeys, who were well-known for their hard work and dedication.

The donkeys, who were known for their labor and dedication, were assigned to the lower levels of the ark, while the more magnificent animals such as lions and elephants were assigned to the higher levels.

The donkeys protested this arrangement, claiming that it was not fair, but the fox, a wise and charismatic creature, persuaded them that this was the natural order of things and that it was necessary for the well-being of all the animals in the arca.

The journey continued, and the fox gained the power and privileges of the pigs, while the donkeys continued to carry the heavy burdens.

The fox made decisions that benefited only themselves, while the donkeys understood that they could not give up the fight for justice and equality.

The donkeys decided to unite with the fox, but the fox refused, and the donkeys understood that they could not give up the fight for justice and equality.

The donkeys were frustrated and defended themselves, but the fox rebelled and kept the power.

The donkeys were defeated, but they realized that they could not give up the fight for justice and equality.

Indeed, Giordano Bruno's story "On Noah's Ark" provides a thought-provoking allegory on power dynamics and the struggle for justice and equality. Through the representation of the hardworking and dedicated donkeys, Bruno explores the theme of oppression and the desire for fairness.
The donkeys, initially assigned to the lower levels of the ark, question the hierarchical arrangement that places them beneath the more magnificent animals. Their protest reflects their recognition of the inherent unfairness in the distribution of power and privileges.
However, the fox, a charismatic and persuasive figure, manages to convince the donkeys that this hierarchical order is natural and necessary for the well-being of all the animals. The fox, symbolizing those in positions of power, manipulates the donkeys' perceptions to maintain their own dominance and advantage.
Despite the fox's efforts to suppress the donkeys' aspirations for justice and equality, the donkeys understand that they cannot simply accept their subjugated position. They realize that unity and resistance are essential in their fight against oppression.
The story explores the tensions between those who hold power and those who seek liberation. Bruno's commentary on power dynamics highlights the inherent struggles faced by individuals or groups seeking to challenge established systems of authority.
Furthermore, it's worth noting that Bruno's writings extended beyond this allegorical story. His philosophical speculations on life in other worlds were groundbreaking for his time. He contemplated the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of other inhabited planets—an area of inquiry that was far ahead of its time.
Bruno's thought-provoking ideas on power, oppression, and the exploration of other worlds continue to resonate with readers today. His work serves as a reminder to question and challenge systems of authority and to strive for justice and equality, even in the face of adversity.
