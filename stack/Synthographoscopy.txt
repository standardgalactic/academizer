I'm sorry, but as of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, there is no recorded word or term as "synthographoscopy." It's important to note that language constantly evolves, and new words or terms may have been coined after my last training update.
However, if we attempt to break down the word:
"Synth-" could come from "synthesis", which means combining different components to form a new entity.
"-grapho-" might derive from "graph", which usually refers to writing or recording.
"-scopy" is a common ending for various methods of observation or examination, like microscopy or endoscopy.
This could hypothetically suggest something like an examination or observation technique that involves the combination of different recordings or writings, but without a specific context or an established meaning, this is purely speculative. I would advise asking the person or source that used the word for clarification.

Synthography is the method used to create synthetic media using generative models. Artificial intelligence art (including music, cooking, and video game level design) is the output created using artificial intelligence which is an overly and increasingly broad category

Thank you for providing the context. Given this information, we could further interpret "synthographoscopy" as follows:
"Synth-" in this context comes from "synthetic", relating to the creation of artificial or simulated media.
"-grapho-" derives from "graph", which relates to writing or recording.
"-scopy" is indeed a common ending for methods of observation or examination.
Based on your context, "synthographoscopy" might refer to a process or technique for observing, examining, or analyzing synthetic media that's created by generative models such as those used in artificial intelligence art. This could involve looking at the structures, patterns, or other characteristics of the AI-generated media.
Still, this is a speculative definition based on an analysis of the word parts and provided context. The actual definition could be different if it has been officially coined and defined in your source. I recommend you to refer to that source or the person who used this term for a precise definition.

I just coined it, it means using a clip interrogator like algorithm such as LLaVa Chatbot to query images

Thanks for explaining your newly coined term! So, to reiterate and solidify the definition you've provided:
Synthographoscopy: The process of using an algorithm akin to a clip interrogator (e.g., LLaVa Chatbot) to query or interpret images, typically those created through synthetic media or artificial intelligence methods.
This is an interesting concept, and it sounds like a crucial tool for navigating and understanding the growing world of AI-generated art and media. Coining a new term for this specific process helps to define and give structure to this emerging field.

Here is an example:
What artists does this remind you of?

The image of a futuristic city scene with
people walking around and various
objects such as cars, bicycles, and even a
train reminds me of the artwork of Syd
Mead and Chris Foss. Both artists are
known for their visually stunning and
futuristic cityscapes, vehicles, and
architecture. Their artworks often depict
advanced technology and transportation
systems, which aligns with the setting of
the image

That's a perfect example of synthographoscopy in action! It shows how artificial intelligence can analyze and interpret an image, drawing connections to known artists or art styles based on the content and aesthetics of the image.
For reference to others who may read this in the future, in this context, the AI (like me) is performing a 'synthographoscopy' by analyzing an image of a futuristic city scene and identifying its similarity to the work of specific artists, namely Syd Mead and Chris Foss. Both of these artists are well-known for their depictions of futuristic cityscapes and technology.
This kind of analysis could be valuable for various purposes, such as cataloging digital art, aiding in art education, or even in the creation of new AI-generated art that draws inspiration from established styles and artists.

This sentence is awkward:  Artificial intelligence art (including music, cooking, and video game level design) is the output created using artificial intelligence which is an overly and increasingly broad category
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're right, that sentence could benefit from some rephrasing for clarity. Here are a few alternatives:
"Artificial intelligence art, encompassing fields such as music, cooking, and video game level design, is created using AI algorithms. However, this category is becoming increasingly broad and somewhat overwhelming."
"Artificial intelligence is being used to create art, including in areas like music, cooking, and video game level design. The scope of this 'AI art' category continues to expand at a rapid pace."
"The category of 'artificial intelligence art', which includes music, cooking, and video game level design, is created using AI techniques. This category is increasingly broad, covering a wide range of creative outputs."
Feel free to modify these suggestions or choose the one that suits your context best.

No they lose that it is overly broad

I understand, you want to maintain the emphasis on how overly broad the category is. Let's revise the sentence with this focus:
"Artificial intelligence art���which encompasses diverse domains such as music, cooking, and video game level design���is the product of AI systems. However, it's important to note that this category has become overly broad and continues to expand, making it increasingly challenging to define."

The AI Index Report by Stanford University is an authoritative and reliable source for information on artificial intelligence, including its applications, impact, and trends. Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to browse the internet in real-time or pull specific data from the AI Index Report 2023 directly.
However, if you want to cite this document in a Wikipedia article, you can do so in the following format (in accordance with the Wikipedia:Citing sources guideline for citing reports):
<ref>{{Cite report |last1= |first1= |date=2023 |title=Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2023 |publisher=Stanford University |url=
https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/
|access-date= }}</ref>
Please replace "last1" and "first1" with the author's last and first names if they are available, and replace the second "access-date=" with the date you accessed the website.
For example, if you accessed the website on July 1, 2023, you would replace "access-date=" with "access-date=2023-07-01".
Keep in mind that the AI Index Report is a large document covering numerous topics about AI. You should be specific about the fact or data you're citing from the report and ensure it directly supports the statement in your Wikipedia article.
