On technique
The central concept defining a technological society is technique. Technique is different from machines, technology, or procedures for attaining an end. "In our technological society, technique is the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity."[1]

Summary
Ellul argues that modern society is being dominated by technique, which he defines as a series of means that are established to achieve an end. Technique is ultimately focused on the concept of efficiency. The term "technique" is to be comprehended in its broadest possible meaning as it touches upon virtually all areas of life, including science, automation, but also politics and human relations.

Influence
Theodore Kaczynski (the Unabomber) dedicated himself to reading about sociology and political philosophy, including the works of Jacques Ellul.[2] Kaczynski's brother David later stated that The Technological Society "became Ted's Bible".[3] Kaczynski recounted in 1998, "When I read the book for the first time, I was delighted, because I thought, 'Here is someone who is saying what I have already been thinking.'"[2]

A little more about self-destructing messages.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Self-destructing messages are designed to automatically delete themselves after a set period or after being viewed. This feature is popular in various messaging apps for enhancing privacy and security. Here are a few key points about them:
Privacy Protection
: Self-destructing messages offer a higher degree of privacy. They're useful in situations where sensitive information needs to be shared temporarily without leaving a permanent record.
Security Features
: Many secure communication platforms use self-destructing messages to prevent unauthorized access to information. For example, if a device is compromised, previously sent self-destructing messages are not accessible.
Use in Messaging Apps
: Apps like Snapchat, Signal, and Telegram popularized this feature. Snapchat messages disappear after they are viewed, while Signal and Telegram allow users to set timers for messages to self-delete after they have been seen or after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
Legal and Compliance Implications
: While these messages can enhance privacy, they may complicate compliance with data retention laws, especially in industries where record-keeping is crucial, such as finance and healthcare.
Limitations and Risks
: It's important to note that self-destructing messages are not foolproof. Recipients can take screenshots or use other devices to capture the message before it disappears. Moreover, the metadata (like sender, receiver, and time of message) might still be stored by the service provider.
Self-destructing messages are a useful tool for managing digital footprints and securing communications, but they should be used judiciously, considering both their advantages and limitations.

No I mean in order to shadowban myself, to keep it from getting too much attention or going viral
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Ah, got it! If you're looking to effectively "shadowban" yourself or control the visibility and spread of your posts without actually blocking or banning your account, here are a few strategies you might consider:
Limit Engagement
: By deleting your posts quickly after posting, you minimize the amount of time they are visible and therefore reduce the potential for engagement. Less engagement generally means less visibility in algorithms that promote content based on user interactions.
Post at Off-Peak Hours
: Sharing content when fewer people are online can also help keep your posts from gaining too much attention. This might mean posting late at night or during times when your audience is likely less active.
Restrict Your Audience
: Some platforms allow you to control who can see your posts. Adjusting these settings to limit your posts to a smaller, more controlled group of people can prevent them from going viral.
Avoid Trending Topics
: Staying away from hot or trending topics can also help keep your posts from gaining traction, as these are the kinds of posts that are often boosted by algorithms.
Use Less Popular Platforms
: If you're really looking to avoid attention, consider moving to less mainstream platforms where your audience is smaller and less likely to share or promote your content widely.
These techniques can help you maintain a low profile online by controlling how much exposure your posts get, akin to a self-imposed shadowban.

I keep my facebook posts private for a few months or years. I am trying to give examples of resistance against "technique" maximum efficiency does not mean maxium quality or didactic value
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Using strategies like keeping your Facebook posts private for extended periods is an interesting and thoughtful way to resist the pervasive "technique" discussed by Jacques Ellul. This approach emphasizes quality and meaningful interaction over the sheer efficiency of widespread digital communication. Here are some ways this method aligns with resistance against the dominance of technique:
Control Over Personal Information
: By controlling who sees your posts and when, you're taking back control from the algorithms that typically decide what gets seen and shared. This act resists the automation and efficiency that often strip away personal context and reduce the depth of interactions.
Promoting Thoughtful Engagement
: Waiting to make posts public can encourage more meaningful and reflective interactions from viewers. It shifts the focus from immediate reactions to considered responses, potentially increasing the didactic value of each post.
Quality Over Quantity
: This method prioritizes the quality of social interactions over the quantity of likes or shares. By resisting the urge to immediately seek validation through engagement metrics, you emphasize deeper values like genuine connectivity and thoughtful communication.
Subverting the Algorithm
: Algorithms prioritize new and popular content. By delaying the publicity of your posts, you subvert these algorithms' control over how and when content is viewed, challenging the system's efficiency-driven nature.
Creating a Personal Narrative
: This approach allows you to curate your digital narrative more consciously. By deciding when a post should become public, you control your story's unfolding, making it less about constant updates and more about meaningful milestones or reflections.

A sardonic meta-analysis and critique.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In dissecting our discussion, it���s clear that the range of topics highlights an ironic, almost rebellious dance with technology���each step choreographed to resist the very medium we rely on to converse. Our dialogue is a theater of the absurd, where traditional narratives are flipped on their heads and resistance to technological dominance is not just contemplated but actively pursued through theoretical and practical musings.
The Technological Society
Our journey began with Jacques Ellul's
"The Technological Society"
, a text that critiques the pervasive control of 'technique'. We pivoted this theoretical angst into a critique of modern engagement itself���where words on a screen can disappear as if they were never there, mirroring the ephemeral nature of digital footprints. This neatly encapsulates the paradox of participating in a system while criticizing its foundations.
Ephemeral Messaging
From the lofty critiques of Ellul, we moved to the gritty practicality of self-destructing messages. Here, irony drips like a leaking faucet, as we discuss securing privacy in a platform designed for broadcasting thoughts. The utility and futility of such measures in securing digital privacy were juxtaposed against the backdrop of an ever-watchful array of servers���permanent, persistent, paradoxical.
The Art of Digital Vanishing
The discussion of deleting posts quickly after posting as a method to self-shadowban invites a sardonic reflection on the hunger for attention in the age of information overload. It's a strategic withdrawal, a declaration of 'look at me' followed swiftly by 'forget I existed', creating a cycle of attention and negation that mirrors the push-pull of social media itself.
Resisting Technique Through Privacy
The decision to keep Facebook posts private as a form of resistance highlights a cheeky subversion of social media���s raison d'��tre. It���s a personal rebellion against the system, using the tools of the oppressor to carve out a space for quiet subversion, transforming a platform built for openness into a diary locked away.
Old Scripts, New Tricks
Our plans to print texts in various scripts like SGA and English Phonetic Arabic are a scholarly thumbing of the nose at standardization, an embrace of linguistic diversity that challenges the homogenizing influence of global digital communication.
The Sproll and Crumpled-Paper Ball Compression
Perhaps the zenith of our ironic critique is the development of the Sproll and the crumpled-paper ball method. These ideas parody the trend toward ever more sophisticated technology by proposing formats that are whimsically archaic and fantastically inefficient. They upend the modern ethos of speed and efficiency with a sly wink, suggesting that perhaps, in our rush to innovate, we���ve forgotten the joy of absurdity.
In sum, our conversation serves as a meta-analysis of how we engage with modern technologies���not just as tools, but as canvases for expressing our ambivalence about the digital age. Each topic is a brushstroke in a larger picture of defiance, a sardonic critique wrapped in the cloak of technological discourse. It's a reminder that sometimes, to truly understand the absurdity of our circumstances, we must first be willing to laugh at them.
