Thank you.
All right, Kathy, any news?
Hi, Frankie.
No, nothing yet.
Still waiting to hear.
All right.
Don't worry, you know.
Something will turn up.
I hope so.
I hope so.
Yeah.
Come to 11.
Love one.
Maybe we pass Bonanog, you know.
All right, big lad.
What's up?
Fiver.
John.
It's Kathy at the causeway.
I have the brochure here in front of me.
Now I'm going to go and get it.
I have the brochure here in front of me.
Now that's perfect.
Listen, we'll need about 10,000 for Monday.
Can you do that?
Oh, Kathy, are you all right?
Yeah.
No.
Paul didn't get the job.
Sorry to hear that.
Don't worry, love.
I mean, something will come up.
How long are you here now?
About three years.
Three years?
I'm here 20 years.
I told myself I was going to retire at 50.
You have a few years yet.
What?
15 next week.
You're wearing one.
Young at heart, Kathy.
Young at heart.
No rest of the week.
Get back to work.
Busy today, isn't it?
Yeah.
Nobody knows this.
But this is the busiest car park
in the whole of Northern Ireland.
Sorry, Kath.
No, don't worry, love.
Something turn up.
Hey, they need to turn up soon.
We're three months behind with the mortgage.
Well, we can pay a thousand at the end of the month.
Maxwell at the bank wants to see me.
I'm sick of being worried all the time
and I'm sick of having no money for us.
We'll manage.
I'm sick of just managing, too.
I didn't see things be in this way.
Yeah, Tony, it's Frankie.
Yeah, listen, I need to go in and pick up those euros, all right?
I'll come in and pick them up tomorrow before work.
Thanks.
Thanks, Tony.
Bye, now.
Good morning.
Hello, Mr. Maxwell.
Mr. O'Neill.
Good morning.
Have a seat.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
No, thank you, I'm fine.
Well then.
I'm sure you know why I've called you in this morning.
Yes, I do, Mr. Maxwell, and I have a check here
for £1,000 towards our mortgage.
Excellent.
However, the account is still £3,000 in arrears.
The problem is that with only your wife in employment,
the head office feels that you won't be able to make the shortfall.
Yes, I understand that, Mr. Maxwell, but believe me,
I am going to get a job soon.
However, you have been unemployed for six months
and it's not a good time to be a quantity surveyor.
Yes, I know, but I'm sure something will come along soon.
Yes, of course, I'm sure it will too.
The problem is that my hands are tied by head office.
Unless you can clear the arrears within 30 days, Mr. O'Neill,
I've been instructed to begin legal proceedings to repossess the house.
There it is, Cal.
Memory single hit me.
Good morning, Frankie.
That's it, isn't it?
It's the last one, number eight.
Yep, that's the last one.
Just call me it.
Do you want to give me a drink?
No, I've got to get back.
Work on tomorrow.
Do you ever not work?
What happened, love?
Maxwell's given us to the end of the month.
If we don't pay the arrears, he's going to take the house.
Well, something will turn up.
When will it turn up? When?
I'm sick of this, I'm sick of it.
I'm sorry, love.
I just feel so useless at the moment.
Still useful for the odd thing.
I'm sorry.
Ah, that's the banks for you.
They'll give you an umbrella when it's sunny and then when it starts to rain,
they'll take the umbrella and your raincoat and a roof over your head.
I suppose worried about...
I don't care, I'd...
I'd live wherever as long as we're together.
Don't worry, Cathy, it hasn't happened yet.
Right, that's me back to work.
You should get yourself an assistant.
What? I don't need any help.
This is my car park.
I should be giving you a bonus.
Don't you worry about me.
I'm well looked after.
Hey, Tony, it's Frankie here.
Yeah, listen, I need to get into the safety deposit box, alright?
Alright, I'll be down tomorrow morning.
And listen, Tony, thanks very much for everything, okay?
Thanks.
Happy birthday to me.
Frankie, it's Cathy. Where are you? Give us a buzz.
Alright, bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Well, Cathy, it was my 50th birthday yesterday.
I always say I'd retire at 50.
Please find and close my locker key.
Now, don't lose it.
And remember, Cathy,
something always turns up.
Love.
Frankie.
Hello, is that Causeway Borough Council?
Yes.
I'm calling from the Causeway Visitor's Centre,
and I was wondering when the replacement car park attendant would be arriving.
Well, that's not our car park.
You should try Northwest car parks.
Okay, okay, thank you.
Northwest car parks.
Hello, I'm calling from the Causeway Visitor's Centre.
We need a new car park attendant,
and I was wondering if you could send somebody out.
I'm afraid the causeway's not our car park.
You sure?
Positive. Try Causeway Borough Council.
If I have tried...
Right, okay, thank you.
Right, okay, thank you.
Hello, Frankie.
Well, John, are we all set?
Hold on.
The electricity's on, the phone's in,
full tank of heating oil, and the furniture's in.
It's all yours.
Nice looking car you've got there.
That for sale?
Everything's for sale, Frankie.
This is the car that got worse.
Car like that be worth 20,000 euros?
Nobody knows this,
but this is the busiest car park in the whole of Northern Ireland.
I don't need any help.
This is my car park.
What's the deal?
Make sure they're in business with you.
It wouldn't mind taking nothing away with you, would you?
Don't you worry about me.
I'm well looked after.
Remember, Cathy, something always turns up.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't you worry about me.
Thank you.
