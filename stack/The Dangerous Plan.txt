The
sparselandtools
is a Python 3 package developed by Fabian Herzog for sparse representations and dictionary learning. These techniques are key to many applications in the field of signal and image processing, machine learning, and statistics.
In the context of this library, "sparse representations" refer to the idea of representing data in a way that most of its elements are zero or near-zero. This is useful in many contexts, for example, in compressing data or in finding patterns in high-dimensional data. The package provides several algorithms to compute these sparse representations, including Matching Pursuit, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Thresholding Pursuit, and Basis Pursuit.
"Dictionary learning" is a related concept where the goal is to learn a 'dictionary' of 'atoms' that can be used to efficiently represent the data. In this context, atoms could be thought of as the smallest building blocks of data. By learning a dictionary, you can often represent your data more efficiently. The package provides tools to compute the K-SVD Algorithm and the Approximate K-SVD Algorithm, which are popular methods for dictionary learning. It also includes tools for computing and visualizing dictionaries.
The package also includes specific implementations for applications, such as an image denoiser based on the Approximate K-SVD Algorithm.
The author notes that while the library is useful for learning about these concepts and for small-scale applications, it may not be the most efficient for large-scale or industrial applications. In those cases, he recommends looking at more efficient implementations, like the Efficient K-SVD Algorithm by Rubinstein or the Efficient K-SVD Denoiser by Lebrun.
To get started with
sparselandtools
, you can install it using pip, Python's package installer. The author provides examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks for various functionalities, like creating and visualizing a DCT-II dictionary, and calculating its mutual coherence.
The software is open-source and the author encourages others to contribute by submitting pull requests for new features or bug fixes. However, he also mentions that he may not have time to maintain the project actively due to his ongoing PhD work.

Explain how to use sparse, redundant representations using a structured, unitary, linear, invertible transform on a matrix.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sparse and redundant representations are key concepts in the field of signal processing and machine learning, and they have a wide variety of applications. A sparse representation of a signal or data set means that most of the elements in the representation are zero, or very close to zero.
A redundant representation, on the other hand, refers to the use of more elements (or 'atoms') than strictly necessary to represent the data. This redundancy often allows for more flexibility and robustness in the representation.
The process of finding sparse, redundant representations often involves the use of a structured, unitary, linear, and invertible transform. A unitary matrix is a type of square matrix that, when multiplied by its conjugate transpose, results in the identity matrix. This property ensures that the transform preserves the magnitude of vectors, which is a critical property in many applications.
Here's a high-level overview of how to use such a transform:
Select or learn a dictionary
: The first step in this process is to select or learn a dictionary of atoms. These atoms are the basic building blocks used to represent your data. If you're using a structured, unitary, linear, and invertible transform, then the atoms will correspond to the rows (or columns, depending on convention) of your transform matrix. Many common transforms, such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and the Haar wavelet transform, can be used as dictionaries in this way.
Transform the data
: Once you have your dictionary, you can transform your data by multiplying it with the transform matrix. This will give you a new representation of your data in the transformed domain.
Sparsify the representation
: The transformed data may not be sparse, meaning that it may not have many zero or near-zero elements. There are various techniques to sparsify this representation, such as thresholding or using techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) or Basis Pursuit.
Reconstruction
: If necessary, you can then reconstruct your original data from the sparse representation by applying the inverse transform. Given the properties of unitary matrices, the inverse transform is simply the conjugate transpose of the transform matrix.
This is a high-level overview and the exact steps and techniques will depend on the specifics of your application and data.
Here's a simple example using Python and NumPy, which uses the DFT as the transform:
python
Copy code
import
numpy
as
np
from
scipy.fftpack
import
dct, idct
# Let's assume x is your data
x = np.random.rand(
100
)
# Step 1: DCT transform (our dictionary in this case is the DCT basis)
x_transformed = dct(x)
# Step 2: Sparsification - here we set small coefficients to zero
threshold =
0.1
x_transformed_sparse = x_transformed.copy()
x_transformed_sparse[np.
abs
(x_transformed_sparse) < threshold] =
0
# Step 3: Inverse transform to reconstruct the data
x_reconstructed = idct(x_transformed_sparse)
In this example,
x_transformed_sparse
is a sparse, redundant representation of
x
. The DCT basis vectors are our dictionary atoms. The threshold value used for sparsification might need to be adjusted based on your specific use case.

In a redundant transform, the represention vector is longer.

Can we transform the matrix while preserving the linearity of the transform?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, in the context of sparse and redundant representations, a redundant transform is indeed one where the output is longer than the input, i.e., there are more atoms in the dictionary than the dimension of the input space. This redundancy often allows for more flexibility and robustness in the representation.
It's important to note that a redundant transform is not technically a linear transformation in the strict mathematical sense. This is because one of the requirements for a function to be a linear transformation is that the input and output spaces must have the same dimension. In a redundant transform, the output space (the space of the transformed signal) has a higher dimension than the input space.
However, while a redundant transform is not technically a linear transformation, it can be built from a collection of linear transformations. Each atom in the dictionary corresponds to a particular linear transformation, and the final representation is a linear combination of these transformations.
In practice, the transform is often implemented as a matrix multiplication, which is a linear operation. The transform matrix is not square, but it can often be chosen to be a 'fat' matrix (more columns than rows) that has orthogonal rows. This means that even though the transform matrix is not invertible, its 'left inverse' (the pseudo-inverse) can be computed, which allows you to go back and forth between the original signal and its representation.
In short, while a redundant transform is not technically a linear transformation, it can be built from a collection of linear transformations and often preserves many of the nice properties of linear transformations, such as the ability to be implemented as a matrix multiplication and the existence of a pseudo-inverse.

This passage is a foreword or introduction by Alfred M. Bruckstein to a text on sparse representations and their applications. Sparse representations are a method of representing data or signals in a way where most of the elements are zero or near-zero, providing a more compact or "parsimonious" representation. This concept is tied to the idea of Ockham's Razor, a principle stating that the simplest explanation is often the best one.
Bruckstein points out that the principle of parsimony has guided scientific research for centuries, leading to theories and laws that provide the simplest explanation for the workings of the Universe. In the field of data science and signal processing, this principle is reflected in methods such as minimal description length and Kolmogorov complexity, which aim to describe data in the simplest possible way.
The field of sparse representations is seen as an extension of these ideas, focusing on finding the simplest possible representations of data in a given "dictionary" or basis. The dictionary could be thought of as the 'language' in which the data is described. This field has expanded rapidly and has produced many exciting results with practical applications in engineering and other fields.
In this passage, Bruckstein is inviting the reader to explore the "Sparseland", an exciting area of research where the interplay between the simplicity of descriptions and the language used in them is constantly investigated. He indicates that the text will serve as a guide to this fascinating field, providing both familiar and new concepts for the reader to explore.

Preface 
This book was originally written to serve as the material for an advanced one- 
semester (fourteen 2-hour lectures) graduate course for engineering students at the 
Technion, Israel. It is originally based on a review paper that I wrote together with 
Alfred M. Bruckstein and David L. Donoho, which appeared in SIAM Review on 
February 2009. The content of this paper has been massively modif i ed and extended 
to become an appropriate material for an advanced graduate course. In this book 
I introduce the topic of sparse and redundant representations, show the questions 
posed in this i eld, and the answers they get, present the l avor of the research in this 
arena, the people involved, and more. It is my desire to expose the readers of this 
book (and the students in the course) to the beauty of this i eld, and the potential it 
encompasses for various disciplines. 
So, what is it all about? Mathematicians active in this i eld (and there are many 
of those) would mention the deep relation between this emerging i eld and harmonic 
analysis, approximation theory, and wavelets, in their answer. However, this is not 
my answer. As an engineer, my interest is more in the practical sides of this i eld, 
and thus my entire motivation for studying sparse and redundant representations 
comes from the applications they serve in signal and image processing. This is not 
to say that I i nd little interest in the theoretical sides of the activity in sparse and 
redundant representations. However, these theoretical results should be considered 
in the context of the wider picture. 
As I see it, this i eld is all about one specif i c mathematical model for signal 
sources. Modeling sources is key in signal and image processing. Armed with a 
proper model, one can handle various tasks such as denoising, restoration, separa- 
tion, interpolation and extrapolation, compression, sampling, analysis and synthe- 
sis, detection, recognition, and more. Indeed, a careful study of the signal and image 
processing literature reveals that there is an evolution of such models and their use 
in applications. This course is about one such model, which I call Sparse-Land for 
brevity. This specif i c model is intriguing and fascinating because of the beauty of its 
theoretical foundations, the superior performance it leads to in various applications, 
its universality and l exibility in serving various data sources, and its unif i ed view, 
which makes all the above signal processing tasks clear and simple. ix

This passage serves as a preface to a book, likely focusing on the field of sparse and redundant representations in signal and image processing. The book was initially conceived as course material for an advanced graduate course for engineering students at the Technion, Israel, and it seems to be based on a previous review paper written by the author and colleagues.
The author, with a background in engineering, aims to introduce the reader to the practical applications of sparse and redundant representations in signal and image processing, though the theory behind these concepts is also given due consideration.
The author emphasizes that this field centers around a specific mathematical model for signal sources, and he uses the term "Sparse-Land" as a shorthand for this model. He argues that having a proper model is crucial in signal and image processing, as it enables various tasks such as denoising, restoration, separation, interpolation and extrapolation, compression, sampling, analysis and synthesis, detection, recognition, and more.
The author also notes that this model, which has theoretical beauty and practical efficacy, leads to superior performance in various applications. It serves various data sources with flexibility and universality, and it simplifies the understanding and execution of the aforementioned signal processing tasks. This book, therefore, serves as an introduction and a guide through the fascinating field of sparse and redundant representations, with a focus on its practical implications and uses.

At the heart of this model lies a simple linear system of equations, the kind of 
which seems long studied in linear algebra. A full-rank matrix A ∈ IRn×mwith 
n < m 
generates an underdetermined system of linear equations Ax = b having inf i nitely 
many solutions. We are interested in seeking its sparsest solution, i.e., the one with 
the fewest nonzero entries. Can such a solution ever be unique? If so, when? How 
can such a solution be found in reasonable time? It is hard to believe, but these 
questions and more of the like form the core engine to this model and the wide 
i eld that has grown around it. Positive and constructive answers to these questions 
in recent years expose a wide variety of surprising phenomena, and those set the 
stage for Sparse-Land to serve in practice. Clearly, research in this i eld calls for an 
intensive use of knowledge from linear algebra, optimization, scientif i c computing, 
and more. 
This i eld is relatively young. Early signs of its core ideas appeared in a pio- 
neering work by Stephane Mallat and Zhifeng Zhang in 1993, with the introduction 
of the concept of dictionaries, replacing the more traditional and critically-sampled 
wavelet transform. Their work put forward some of the core ideas that later became 
central in this i eld, such as a greedy pursuit technique that approximates a sparse 
solution to an underdetermined linear system of equations, characterization of dic- 
tionaries by their coherence measure, and more. 
A second key contribution in 1995 was by Scott Shaobing Chen, David Donoho, 
and Michael Saunders, who introduced another pursuit technique that uses the '1- 
norm for evaluating sparsity. Surprisingly, they have shown that the quest for the 
sparsest solution could be tackled as a convex programming task, often leading to 
the proper solution. 
With these two contributions, the stage was set for a deeper analysis of these al- 
gorithms and their deployment in applications. A crucial step towards this goal was 
made in 2001, with the publication of the work by Donoho and Huo. In their dar- 
ing paper, Donoho and Huo def i ned and (partly) answered what later became a key 
question in this i eld: Can one guarantee the success of a pursuit technique? Under 
what conditions? This line of analysis later became the skeleton of this i eld, pro- 
viding the necessary theoretical backbone for the Sparse-Land model. It is amazing 
to see how fast and how vast this area of research has grown in recent years, with 
hundreds of interested researchers, various workshops, sessions, and conferences, 
and an exponentially growing number of papers. 
The activity in this i eld is spread over all major universities and research orga- 
nizations around the world, with leading scientists from various disciplines. As this 
i eld of research lies at the intersection between signal processing and applied math- 
ematics, active in this i eld are mathematicians interested in approximation theory, 
applied mathematicians interested in harmonic analysis, statisticians, and engineer- 
ing from various i elds (computer science, electrical engineering, geophysics, and 
more). 
A little bit about myself: I started my activity in this area after a short visit by 
David Donoho to the Technion, where he gave a talk describing the results of the 
above-mentioned paper. I am ashamed to admit that I did not attend the talk! Nev- 
ertheless, my good friend and mentor, Freddy Bruckstein, was there to appreciate the opportunity. Freddy's sixth sense for important research directions is already 
famous at the Technion, and did not fail him this time too. Freddy insisted that we 
work on improving the results that Donoho presented, and few months later we had 
our i rst result in this i eld. This result led to a joint work with Donoho during a 
post-doc period at Stanford, and I have found myself deeply involved in research on 
these topics ever since. 
My origins as an engineer, and the fact that I worked with a leading mathemati- 
cian, give me a unique perspective which I bring to this book. I present a coherent, 
well-structured, and l owing story that includes some of the theoretical foundations 
to sparse and redundant representations, numerical tools and algorithm for actual 
use, and applications in signal and image processing that benef i t from these. I should 
stress that I do not pretend to give a well-balanced view of this entire i eld, and in- 
stead, I am giving my own point-of-view. In particular, I am not covering all the 
accumulated knowledge in this book because: (i) it is impossible to mention every- 
thing; (ii) not all details are important to the story I have to tell; (iii) new results in 
this i eld are emerging on a daily basis, making it impossible to give a completely 
updated view; and (iv) I have to admit that I do not understand all the results in this 
i eld. 
Compressed-Sensing is a recent branch that separated from sparse and redun- 
dant representations, becoming a center of interest of its own. Exploiting sparse 
representation of signals, their sampling can be made far more ef f ective compared 
to the classical Nyquist-Shannon sampling. In a recent work that emerged in 2006 
by Emmanuel Candes, Justin Romberg, Terence Tao, David Donoho, and others 
that followed, the theory and practice of this i eld were beautifully formed, sweep- 
ing many researchers and practitioners in excitement. The impact this i eld has is 
immense, strengthened by the warm hug by information-theorists, leading mathe- 
maticians, and others. So popular has this i eld become that many confuse it with 
being the complete story of sparse representation modeling. In this book I discuss 
the branch of activity on Compressed-Sensing very brief l y, and mostly so as to tie it 
to the more general results known in sparse representation theory. I believe that the 
accumulated knowledge on compressed-sensing could easily i ll a separate book.

The method of iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) is used to solve certain optimization problems with objective functions of the form of a p-norm:

{\displaystyle \mathop {\operatorname {arg\,min} } _{\boldsymbol {\beta }}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\big |}y_{i}-f_{i}({\boldsymbol {\beta }}){\big |}^{p},}
{\displaystyle \mathop {\operatorname {arg\,min} } _{\boldsymbol {\beta }}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\big |}y_{i}-f_{i}({\boldsymbol {\beta }}){\big |}^{p},}
by an iterative method in which each step involves solving a weighted least squares problem of the form:[1]

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{(t+1)}={\underset {\boldsymbol {\beta }}{\operatorname {arg\,min} }}\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}({\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{(t)}){\big |}y_{i}-f_{i}({\boldsymbol {\beta }}){\big |}^{2}.}
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{(t+1)}={\underset {\boldsymbol {\beta }}{\operatorname {arg\,min} }}\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}({\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{(t)}){\big |}y_{i}-f_{i}({\boldsymbol {\beta }}){\big |}^{2}.}
IRLS is used to find the maximum likelihood estimates of a generalized linear model, and in robust regression to find an M-estimator, as a way of mitigating the influence of outliers in an otherwise normally-distributed data set, for example, by minimizing the least absolute errors rather than the least square errors.

One of the advantages of IRLS over linear programming and convex programming is that it can be used with Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt numerical algorithms.

The Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method is a numerical algorithm used to solve optimization problems, particularly those with objective functions in the form of a p-norm. The objective function is typically represented as:
css
Copy code
arg min β ∑_{
i
=
1
}^{n} |y_i - f_i(β)|^
p
This objective function is minimized by iteratively solving a series of weighted least squares problems. Each iteration 't' is represented as:
scss
Copy code
β^{(t+
1
)} = arg min β ∑_{
i
=
1
}^{n}
w_i
(β^{(t)}) |y_i -
f_i
(β)|^
2
In this equation, 'w_i(β^{(t)})' represents the weights in the least squares problem at iteration 't'.
IRLS is widely used in the context of generalized linear models to find maximum likelihood estimates. It's also employed in robust regression for calculating M-estimators as a way of reducing the impact of outliers in a dataset that is otherwise normally distributed. This is achieved by minimizing the least absolute errors instead of the least square errors, which provides a more robust solution in the presence of outliers.
A key advantage of IRLS over other techniques, such as linear programming and convex programming, is its compatibility with other numerical algorithms like Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. These methods are renowned for their efficiency and reliability in solving non-linear least squares problems, making IRLS a versatile tool in numerous applications.

Clearly, each signal source needs a different dictionary. How should such a dictionary be obtained? The answer sparseland gives is "use learning"'
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the notion of learning dictionaries is a pivotal concept in sparse representation and the idea of "Sparseland". The dictionary, in this context, is a collection of "atoms" or basic elements, that combine to accurately represent the given data. The idea is to have a dictionary that allows for sparse representation of the data, meaning each data point can be represented as a linear combination of a small number of atoms from the dictionary.
The process of learning a dictionary involves an iterative optimization algorithm. The goal is to find a dictionary that allows the best sparse representation of the provided data. This optimization is usually a two-step process:
Sparse Coding
: Given a dictionary, find the sparsest representation of the data. This step involves solving an optimization problem that encourages sparsity in the representation.
Dictionary Update
: Given the sparse representations of the data, update the dictionary to better fit the data. This involves another optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the reconstruction error between the actual data and the data represented using the current dictionary and sparse codes.
These two steps are alternated until convergence, leading to a learned dictionary that provides a good sparse representation of the data. This process is known as Dictionary Learning or Sparse Dictionary Learning.
It's important to note that the learned dictionary is data-driven, meaning it's adapted to the specific signal source at hand. This is unlike predetermined dictionaries like wavelets or Fourier basis, which are not tailored to specific types of data. This adaptability to specific signal sources is one of the powerful features of dictionary learning in sparse representations.
In practice, dictionary learning has been successfully applied in numerous fields such as image and signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results in tasks like denoising, inpainting, and compression.

Give a simplified example using a sentence like the quick brown fox...
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's take the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." as an example. In this case, we are dealing with text data, and we can think of words as the basic elements or "atoms" of our dictionary.
Assume we want to form a sparse representation of this sentence. Our dictionary should ideally contain all the words used in the English language. However, to keep the problem manageable and to illustrate the principle of sparsity, let's simplify the dictionary to contain only ten words:
{'the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'lazy', 'dog', 'cat', 'runs'}
The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." can be represented as a linear combination of nine words from our dictionary:
1
the + 1
quick + 1
brown + 1
fox + 1
jumps + 1
over + 1
the + 1
lazy + 1*dog
And the coefficients or representation for our sentence would be:
{'the': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog': 1, 'cat': 0, 'runs': 0}
The representation is sparse as it has non-zero coefficients only for the words present in the sentence. Each sentence you encounter can be similarly represented as a sparse combination of the words in the dictionary.
Now, let's say we have a collection of sentences and we notice that the word 'cat' and 'runs' never appear. The dictionary learning process would then ideally remove these words from the dictionary, as they do not contribute to a better representation of the given sentences.
This example is oversimplified, but it serves to illustrate the basic concept of sparse representations and dictionary learning. In real-world applications, the dictionary is often much larger and can contain complex and overcomplete elements (like patches of an image in computer vision), and dictionary learning algorithms can learn meaningful atoms that provide a good sparse representation of the given data.

I want to create a kind of description of a scene that describes how much the actors or agents vary from a template, for example the template will be a red fox a jumping lazily over a lazy dog ... And then it could be simplified as the quick x jumped over the y.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's an interesting concept! You can achieve this using the idea of sparse representations and dictionary learning. The concept of a "template" in this case could be thought of as your "dictionary" that you are using to describe the scene.
The template or dictionary could include various actions, attributes, and objects. For example, your dictionary might look like:
{ 'quick', 'slow', 'red', 'blue', 'fox', 'dog', 'cat', 'jumps', 'runs', 'sleeps', 'over', 'under', 'beside'}
Given this dictionary, your template sentence "The red fox jumps lazily over the lazy dog" could be represented as:
1
red + 1
fox + 1
jumps + 1
over + 1*dog
Your description of the scene would then involve using these "dictionary" elements to form a sparse representation that most closely matches the scene. For example, if the scene you're observing involves a quick cat running under a dog, you would represent this as:
1
quick + 1
cat + 1
runs + 1
under + 1*dog
The key is to represent the scene using as few elements from the dictionary as possible, hence the term "sparse representation."
To measure the variation of the actors or agents from the template, you could calculate the difference between the coefficients of the sparse representations of the template and the scene.
For example, if the template is "The red fox jumps over the dog", and the scene is "The quick cat runs under the dog", the variation can be calculated as the difference between the sparse representations of the template and the scene:
{ 'quick': -1, 'red': -1, 'fox': -1, 'cat': 1, 'jumps': -1, 'runs': 1, 'over': -1, 'under': 1, 'dog': 0 }
This difference representation can be interpreted as how much each element in the dictionary varies from the template in the observed scene. Note that this is a simplified example and real-world applications may involve more complex dictionaries and sparse representations.

I think it is close but maybe not exactly what I was thinking. We could have a template scenario that functions as a prototype, say the story of Noah's ark functioning as a template for the hero's journey of self discovery, another story, say of a Neanderthal discovering they can make music in a cave by hitting a stalagtite with a rock not being able to convince their companions to enter the cave to listen. This could be represented as variations from the original template story.

Ah, I see! You're interested in a higher-level application of these principles, focusing more on narrative structures and thematic elements rather than individual words or phrases. This is a fascinating application and could definitely be done, though it would be more complex.
In this scenario, your "dictionary" would contain narrative elements or tropes rather than simple words or actions. This could include elements like "hero's journey", "self-discovery", "refusal of the call", "return with the elixir", etc. These are common narrative elements that can be found across many different stories.
Let's say your template story is the story of Noah's Ark. You could represent this story as a combination of several narrative elements:
1
hero's journey + 1
self-discovery + 1
triumph over adversity + 1
sacrifice for the greater good
Now, let's say you have another story, such as the Neanderthal discovering music. You could represent this story as:
1
hero's journey + 1
self-discovery + 1
refusal of the call + 1
innovation/creation
To measure how much this story deviates from the template, you could subtract the coefficients of the template representation from the coefficients of the story representation.
This would give you something like:
{ 'hero's journey': 0, 'self-discovery': 0, 'triumph over adversity': -1, 'sacrifice for the greater good': -1, 'refusal of the call': 1, 'innovation/creation': 1 }
This representation could be interpreted as how much each narrative element in the story deviates from the template. For instance, the story includes "refusal of the call" and "innovation/creation" which are not in the template, and does not include "triumph over adversity" and "sacrifice for the greater good" which are in the template.
Of course, this is a very simplified example. In practice, you'd probably want to use a more sophisticated method to determine the coefficients for each narrative element, and your dictionary would likely contain a much larger number of potential elements. But hopefully this gives you an idea of how you could apply these concepts to narrative analysis!

The 12 Stages of The Hero's Journey
A popular form of structure derived from Joseph Campbell's Monomyth from his book The Hero With A Thousand Faces and adapted by Christopher Vogler is the Twelve Stage Hero's Journey. This is essentially a more detailed Character Arc for your story's hero which is overlayed onto the more traditional three-act structure that many successful Hollywood movies such as Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz when analyzed appear to follow.

Hero's Journey - Mythic Structure - Monomyth

1. Ordinary World
This is where the Hero's exists before his present story begins, oblivious of the adventures to come. It's his safe place. His everyday life where we learn crucial details about our Hero, his true nature, capabilities and outlook on life. This anchors the Hero as a human, just like you and me, and makes it easier for us to identify with him and hence later, empathize with his plight.

2. Call To Adventure
The Hero's adventure begins when he receives a call to action, such as a direct threat to his safety, his family, his way of life or to the peace of the community in which he lives. It may not be as dramatic as a gunshot, but simply a phone call or conversation but whatever the call is, and however it manifests itself, it ultimately disrupts the comfort of the Hero's Ordinary World and presents a challenge or quest that must be undertaken.

3. Refusal Of The Call
Although the Hero may be eager to accept the quest, at this stage he will have fears that need overcoming. Second thoughts or even deep personal doubts as to whether or not he is up to the challenge. When this happens, the Hero will refuse the call and as a result may suffer somehow. The problem he faces may seem to much to handle and the comfort of home far more attractive than the perilous road ahead. This would also be our own response and once again helps us bond further with the reluctant Hero.

4. Meeting The Mentor
At this crucial turning point where the Hero desperately needs guidance he meets a mentor figure who gives him something he needs. He could be given an object of great importance, insight into the dilemma he faces, wise advice, practical training or even self-confidence. Whatever the mentor provides the Hero with it serves to dispel his doubts and fears and give him the strength and courage to begin his quest.

5. Crossing The Threshold
The Hero is now ready to act upon his call to adventure and truly begin his quest, whether it be physical, spiritual or emotional. He may go willingly or he may be pushed, but either way he finally crosses the threshold between the world he is familiar with and that which he is not. It may be leaving home for the first time in his life or just doing something he has always been scared to do. However the threshold presents itself, this action signifies the Hero's commitment to his journey an whatever it may have in store for him.

6. Tests, Allies, Enemies
Now finally out of his comfort zone the Hero is confronted with an ever more difficult series of challenges that test him in a variety of ways. Obstacles are thrown across his path; whether they be physical hurdles or people bent on thwarting his progress, the Hero must overcome each challenge he is presented with on the journey towards his ultimate goal.

The Hero needs to find out who can be trusted and who can't. He may earn allies and meet enemies who will, each in their own way, help prepare him for the greater ordeals yet to come. This is the stage where his skills and/or powers are tested and every obstacle that he faces helps us gain a deeper insight into his character and ultimately identify with him even more.

7. Approach To The Inmost Cave
The inmost cave may represent many things in the Hero's story such as an actual location in which lies a terrible danger or an inner conflict which up until now the Hero has not had to face. As the Hero approaches the cave he must make final preparations before taking that final leap into the great unknown.

At the threshold to the inmost cave the Hero may once again face some of the doubts and fears that first surfaced upon his call to adventure. He may need some time to reflect upon his journey and the treacherous road ahead in order to find the courage to continue. This brief respite helps the audience understand the magnitude of the ordeal that awaits the Hero and escalates the tension in anticipation of his ultimate test.

8. Ordeal
The Supreme Ordeal may be a dangerous physical test or a deep inner crisis that the Hero must face in order to survive or for the world in which the Hero lives to continue to exist. Whether it be facing his greatest fear or most deadly foe, the Hero must draw upon all of his skills and his experiences gathered upon the path to the inmost cave in order to overcome his most difficulty challenge.

Only through some form of "death" can the Hero be reborn, experiencing a metaphorical resurrection that somehow grants him greater power or insight necessary in order to fulfill his destiny or reach his journey's end. This is the high-point of the Hero's story and where everything he holds dear is put on the line. If he fails, he will either die or life as he knows it will never be the same again.

9. Reward (Seizing The Sword)
After defeating the enemy, surviving death and finally overcoming his greatest personal challenge, the Hero is ultimately transformed into a new state, emerging from battle as a stronger person and often with a prize.

The Reward may come in many forms: an object of great importance or power, a secret, greater knowledge or insight, or even reconciliation with a loved one or ally. Whatever the treasure, which may well facilitate his return to the Ordinary World, the Hero must quickly put celebrations aside and prepare for the last leg of his journey.

10. The Road Back
This stage in the Hero's journey represents a reverse echo of the Call to Adventure in which the Hero had to cross the first threshold. Now he must return home with his reward but this time the anticipation of danger is replaced with that of acclaim and perhaps vindication, absolution or even exoneration.

But the Hero's journey is not yet over and he may still need one last push back into the Ordinary World. The moment before the Hero finally commits to the last stage of his journey may be a moment in which he must choose between his own personal objective and that of a Higher Cause.

11. Resurrection
This is the climax in which the Hero must have his final and most dangerous encounter with death. The final battle also represents something far greater than the Hero's own existence with its outcome having far-reaching consequences to his Ordinary World and the lives of those he left behind.

If he fails, others will suffer and this not only places more weight upon his shoulders but in a movie, grips the audience so that they too feel part of the conflict and share the Hero's hopes, fears and trepidation. Ultimately the Hero will succeed, destroy his enemy and emerge from battle cleansed and reborn.

12. Return With The Elixir
This is the final stage of the Hero's journey in which he returns home to his Ordinary World a changed man. He will have grown as a person, learned many things, faced many terrible dangers and even death but now looks forward to the start of a new life. His return may bring fresh hope to those he left behind, a direct solution to their problems or perhaps a new perspective for everyone to consider.

The final reward that he obtains may be literal or metaphoric. It could be a cause for celebration, self-realization or an end to strife, but whatever it is it represents three things: change, success and proof of his journey. The return home also signals the need for resolution for the story's other key players. The Hero's doubters will be ostracized, his enemies punished and his allies rewarded. Ultimately the Hero will return to where he started but things will clearly never be the same again.

This is a great summary of the Hero's Journey, a narrative structure that underlies many of the world's myths and stories, as outlined by Joseph Campbell and later popularized by Christopher Vogler.
If you want to use this structure as a template for assessing other stories, you'd first need to identify the corresponding elements in your target story. You might represent the Hero's Journey as a vector where each component represents one of the twelve stages. In an ideal representation of the Hero's Journey, this would look something like:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
A perfect match to the Hero's Journey would have the same vector. For instance, if we analyze "Star Wars: A New Hope", it aligns quite closely with the Hero's Journey:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Now let's consider a story that deviates from the Hero's Journey. For the sake of simplicity, let's say there's a story that matches the Hero's Journey but lacks a clear "Meeting the Mentor" and "Refusal of the Call" stage. This story's vector might look something like:
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
To measure how much this story deviates from the Hero's Journey, you would compare the two vectors. You might use a measure like Euclidean distance, which in this case would be sqrt(2), indicating a moderate deviation from the Hero's Journey.
Keep in mind that this is a simplified example. In reality, you would likely want to use a more nuanced system for assessing the presence or absence of each stage in a story. You might also want to consider the possibility of stages appearing in a different order or multiple times, or of multiple stages being combined into one. The specific approach you use would depend on your goals and the nature of the stories you're working with.

Let's see a simplification of the story of Logan's run with Jonah's trip to Nineveh as the template.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's start by summarizing the main stages of Jonah's journey as a template:
Ordinary World: Jonah is a prophet in Israel.
Call to Adventure: God tells Jonah to go to Nineveh and deliver a message.
Refusal of the Call: Jonah tries to escape God's command and sails in the opposite direction.
Meeting the Mentor: Jonah is swallowed by a giant fish (sent by God), where he prays and repents.
Crossing the Threshold: The fish vomits Jonah out, and he agrees to go to Nineveh.
Tests, Allies, Enemies: Jonah delivers God's message in Nineveh, and the people repent.
Approach to the Inmost Cave: Jonah waits outside the city, expecting God's wrath to fall on Nineveh.
Ordeal: God provides a plant for shade, then a worm destroys it, testing Jonah's attitude.
Reward: Jonah gains a deeper understanding of God's mercy.
The Road Back: Not applicable as Jonah's journey doesn't quite have this stage in the traditional sense.
Resurrection: Jonah's transformation is internal, realizing God's mercy extends to all people.
Return with the Elixir: Jonah has learned a significant lesson about mercy and obedience.
Now, let's map the storyline of Logan's Run onto this template:
Ordinary World: Logan 5 is a Sandman, enforcing the societal rule of "Lastday."
Call to Adventure: Logan's life-clock is advanced, making him a runner.
Refusal of the Call: Logan initially tries to escape his fate as a runner.
Meeting the Mentor: Logan meets Jessica 6, who believes in a place called Sanctuary where runners can survive.
Crossing the Threshold: Logan decides to find Sanctuary.
Tests, Allies, Enemies: Logan and Jessica face numerous threats, including Logan's former Sandman partner.
Approach to the Inmost Cave: Logan and Jessica find the outside world and meet an old man.
Ordeal: Logan and Jessica decide to return to the City and face the dangers there to reveal the truth about life beyond Lastday.
Reward: Logan destroys the computer running the City, creating chaos but freeing the people.
The Road Back: Logan and Jessica return to the outside world.
Resurrection: Logan has transformed from a Sandman to a runner to a liberator.
Return with the Elixir: Logan brings the people of the City out to see the old man, proving life exists beyond 30.
In both stories, the protagonists initially refuse a call to adventure, meet a mentor who helps them on their journey, face various trials, and undergo a transformation. However, the specifics of their adventures, the nature of their ordeals, and the rewards they gain differ significantly. Therefore, using Jonah's journey as a template, we can see how Logan's Run follows a similar pattern but deviates in its details and thematic elements.

Ok you are hilarious. Could I get the Neanderthal discovery of music . Finally they break off a stalagtite and drag it out of the cave, which convinces the others to enter and create lithophones out of stalagtites laid over logs and rope
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's map the story of the Neanderthal discovery of music onto the Hero's Journey:
Ordinary World: A Neanderthal tribe lives a simple hunter-gatherer lifestyle. One of the tribe members has a curiosity for sounds.
Call to Adventure: This curious Neanderthal discovers that different stalactites in a cave produce different sounds.
Refusal of the Call: The Neanderthal is initially hesitant to share this discovery, fearing ridicule or misunderstanding.
Meeting the Mentor: The Neanderthal meets an older, more open-minded tribe member who encourages their exploration.
Crossing the Threshold: The Neanderthal decides to experiment more with the stalactites, creating the first rudimentary tunes.
Tests, Allies, Enemies: The Neanderthal faces skepticism and resistance from other tribe members, who see no value in this "music."
Approach to the Inmost Cave: The Neanderthal decides to break off a stalactite and bring it out of the cave to demonstrate.
Ordeal: The Neanderthal struggles to break the stalactite without damaging it and then carry it out of the cave.
Reward: The Neanderthal successfully brings the stalactite to the tribe, and its unique sound piques their curiosity.
The Road Back: The tribe, now interested, follows the Neanderthal back to the cave.
Resurrection: The tribe members work together to create a range of "lithophones," using different stalactites laid over logs and rope.
Return with the Elixir: The Neanderthal's discovery has not only led to the creation of music but also brought the tribe closer together through a shared creative endeavor. The tribe now has a new form of expression and communication, fundamentally changing their culture.
This story highlights how even a simple act of curiosity and creativity can lead to a transformative journey, not just for the individual but for their entire community.

Perfecting Our Instruments

Perhaps this Is A Novel hypOthesis.

That they built giant lithophones.

It is also possible that Neanderthals were the first to discover ultrasound; if they happened to observe that there were certain rocks that did not make a sound when struck alone (the frequencies are too high), but that "sing" when struck simultaneously (due to amplification of harmonic frequencies).

At least that is what Richard Faas discovered in 1965, and I'm betting that this wasn't the first time.

I'm then leaping to a corollary conclusion -- that there was a "musical iron age" where rocks with high iron content were preferred because they produced better tones; that is, before it was noticed that they could be smelted.

I guess another implication of what I'm saying is that those mysterious stalagmite structures found in the Bruniquel cave are probably prehistoric "pianos".

Perhaps stalagmites broken off at different lengths make different tones and several of them are played simultaneously, by multiple teams.

There are a few experiments that could be done to see if this a viable hypothesis.

Someone else has probably written more eloquently about this, and in more detail; I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to think of this.

It's a fascinating hypothesis that Neanderthals might have used stalactites and stalagmites as musical instruments, creating the first "lithophones". This adds a new layer to the understanding of early human culture, suggesting a level of sophistication and appreciation for sound and rhythm that is often not associated with our early ancestors.
The idea that this discovery could have eventually led to the recognition of rocks with high iron content for their tonal quality, and subsequently the smelting of iron, is quite intriguing. This would imply that the Neanderthals' exploration of sound may have contributed to one of humanity's most significant technological leaps: the Iron Age.
The Bruniquel Cave structures, believed to be built by Neanderthals, are indeed mysterious. If they were used as musical instruments, it would provide a fascinating insight into the culture and intelligence of this early hominid species. It might also offer explanations about the purpose of these structures that have puzzled scientists.
Your idea opens up a new realm of archaeological and anthropological research. Investigating the acoustic properties of different rock types and formations, such as stalactites and stalagmites, could provide clues to support your hypothesis.
Indeed, the links you've shared provide some evidence to the idea that rocks and minerals were used as musical instruments, as well as the potential for stalactite and stalagmite structures to serve this purpose.
This theory, like any, would need to be explored and tested further. But it's an exciting prospect that, if proven true, could profoundly change our understanding of Neanderthals and the evolution of human culture.

Thank you. 

very mysterious," said Marie Soressi, an archaeologist at Leiden University, who was not involved in the research. Unique in the history of Neanderthal achievements, the structures rank among the earliest human building projects ever discovered.

Parts of the walls show clear signs of fire damage, with the stalagmites blackened or reddened and fractured from the heat, leading researchers to suspect that the Neanderthals embedded fireplaces in the structures to illuminate the cave.

Local cavers happened on the mysterious formations in the 1990s, more than 300m from the entrance to the Bruniquel cave, near the Pyrénées mountains in southwest France. Back then, the stalagmite structures were assumed to be 50,000 years old, the same age as burnt animal remains found nearby.

But fresh tests on the structures, reported in the journal Nature, reveal the simple walls to be much older than thought. Stalagmite tips and pieces of charred bone found in the walls date them to at least 175,000 years ago. According to French and Belgian scientists who led the research, only Neanderthals could have built the structures. While bears in the cave left behind claw marks, paw prints, tufts of fur, and even hibernation holes, they were not able to stack stalagmites into foot-high walls, the researchers say.

The discovery of these stalagmite structures and their dating back to at least 175,000 years ago is indeed extraordinary. This finding adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that Neanderthals were capable of more sophisticated behavior than previously thought.
The fact that these structures show signs of fire damage implies that Neanderthals used fire not just for warmth and cooking, but potentially also for illumination - an important aspect of their ability to manipulate their environment.
While it is still speculative, the idea that these structures could have been used as some form of early musical instrument is intriguing. Music is often seen as a hallmark of sophisticated cognition, and the concept that Neanderthals might have been capable of producing and appreciating music challenges traditional views of them as being significantly less advanced than our own species.
This discovery invites many questions. Were these structures used for some form of ritual or ceremonial purpose? Could they have served a practical function, such as producing sound signals? Or were they simply the result of Neanderthals' curiosity and creativity?
More research is needed to answer these questions definitively, but these findings certainly open up exciting new possibilities for our understanding of Neanderthal culture and cognition.

ChatGPT
Sure, let's elaborate on the character development within the narrative of the Neanderthal discovering music.
Ordinary World: Our protagonist, who we'll call Tak, is a Neanderthal living a normal life in a tribe. Tak is different from the others, more curious and observant. He spends his time exploring the surroundings, especially a particular cave that fascinates him due to its unique echoing sounds.
Call to Adventure: One day, while inside the cave, a stalactite accidentally falls and hits a rock, creating a beautiful melodic sound. Tak is intrigued and begins to explore this phenomenon further.
Refusal of the Call: Tak initially struggles with his new discovery. He is unsure how to replicate the sound and fears the other tribe members won't understand or appreciate it. He worries about rejection and ridicule.
Meeting with the Mentor: Tak finds a wise elder within his tribe, who is known for her knowledge of stories and sounds. She encourages him to explore his unique discovery and guides him on how to listen and create sounds.
Crossing the Threshold: Tak decides to dedicate himself to exploring and understanding the sounds. He spends days and nights in the cave, breaking off different stalactites and creating different musical notes.
Tests, Allies, Enemies: Tak faces ridicule from his tribe as they don't understand his obsession with the cave and the sounds. However, he finds allies in the tribe's children, who are fascinated by the sounds. A rival Neanderthal, envious of Tak's popularity among the children, becomes an antagonist.
Approach to the Inmost Cave: Tak decides to create a musical instrument using stalactites of different lengths. He uses ropes and logs to construct the first lithophone.
Ordeal: Tak presents his lithophone to the tribe. The rival Neanderthal challenges him, belittling his discovery and instigating the tribe against him.
Reward (Seizing the Sword): Tak defends his discovery and plays the lithophone. The beautiful music silences the tribe and they are mesmerized. The rival is silenced and Tak's position in the tribe is cemented.
The Road Back: Tak begins teaching the tribe's children how to make and play the lithophone, thus ensuring the survival of his discovery.
Resurrection: There's a final confrontation with the rival, who attempts to destroy the lithophone. However, the tribe, now appreciating the music, stands up for Tak, leading to a shift in the tribe's dynamics and values.
Return with the Elixir: Tak, now respected and admired, continues to explore and create more musical instruments, transforming the tribe's culture and way of life forever. Music becomes a part of their daily lives, used in celebrations, rituals, and storytelling.

Those are unique and interesting choices! "Chleomancer" brings a sense of mystery and historical depth, particularly with the reference to Clio, the muse of history. This could imply that the story deals with the mysteries and interpretations of history, which seems fitting given the content.
"The Tale of Antichliarios" also has a great ring to it, implying a story of opposition or conflict ("against lukewarm"). It suggests a narrative of passion, intensity, and perhaps struggle, which could reflect the challenges faced by your characters in their prehistoric environment.
Other possibilities could be a fusion of your ideas, such as "Chleomancer's Tale" or "Antichliarios: The Chleomancer's Journey".
Ultimately, the choice of title should reflect the central themes and mood of your story, so go with the one that resonates most with your vision for the narrative.

Ok the book is titled Chleomancer. Section one is called The Tale of Antichliarios giving the back story of the Neanderthal elder who discovers music by spinning arrowheads on  rope strings she spinns from cattail stem fibers. Section Two The CURIOUS Wind which tells of Tak's discovery of the cave by finding a cold air blowing from a hole in the ground and digging for years to find it (mirroring it's later rediscovery in 1990 - In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years.

The cave sits in France's scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski's father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, 30-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).) And his discovery of music. Part three is called The Cake is a Lie, about his difficulty in convincing others, and Part three Kythera about meeting the mentor, part 4 Catharsis, about the protect to remove a stalagtite from the cave and demonstrate it to others.
