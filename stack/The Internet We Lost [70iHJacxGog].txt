Music
But you could hear the frown
But you look really high
You look like an angel
Your skin looks like a cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it happens
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want to feel yours
But I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special
But I'm a weirdo
She's right here
She's right here
Love, she's right here
Love, she's right here
I'm a weirdo
But I'm a weirdo
You're so very special
I wish I was special
