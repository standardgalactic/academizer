On the Geometry of Deep Bayesian Active Learning

Reviewed Version (pdf): /references/pdf?id=A_WZfcGQJ
Keywords: Bayesian active learning, geometric interpretation, core-set construction, model uncertainty, ellipsoid.
Abstract: We present  geometric Bayesian active learning by disagreements (GBALD), a framework that performs BALD on its geometric interpretation interacting with a deep learning model. There are two main components in GBALD: initial acquisitions based on core-set construction and model uncertainty estimation with those initial acquisitions. Our key innovation is to construct the core-set on an ellipsoid, not typical sphere, preventing its updates towards the boundary regions of the distributions. Main improvements over BALD are twofold: relieving sensitivity to uninformative prior and reducing redundant information of model uncertainty. To guarantee the improvements, our generalization analysis proves that, compared to typical Bayesian  spherical interpretation, geodesic search with ellipsoid can derive a tighter lower error bound and achieve higher probability to obtain  a nearly zero error. Experiments on acquisitions with several scenarios demonstrate that, yielding slight perturbations to noisy and repeated samples,  GBALD further achieves significant accuracy improvements  than BALD, BatchBALD and other baselines.

The paper "On the Geometry of Deep Bayesian Active Learning" by Xiaofeng Cao and Ivor Tsang, initially submitted to the ICLR 2021 conference, presents a framework called geometric Bayesian active learning by disagreements (GBALD). This framework combines Bayesian active learning with a geometric interpretation, focusing on interactions with a deep learning model. The authors introduce two main components within GBALD: initial acquisitions based on core-set construction and model uncertainty estimation using these initial acquisitions.
A key innovation in GBALD is the use of an ellipsoid for constructing the core-set, rather than the more typical approach of using a sphere. This choice of an ellipsoid prevents the core-set updates from being directed towards boundary regions of the distributions. The authors highlight two primary improvements over traditional Bayesian active learning by disagreements (BALD) in this framework:
Reduced Sensitivity to Uninformative Prior:
By utilizing the ellipsoid-based core-set construction, GBALD is less sensitive to uninformative prior information, improving the efficiency of active learning.
Reduced Redundant Information in Model Uncertainty:
The use of the ellipsoid further reduces redundant information in model uncertainty estimation, leading to more effective active learning decisions.
To substantiate these improvements, the authors provide a generalization analysis that demonstrates how the geodesic search with an ellipsoid yields a tighter lower error bound compared to the typical spherical interpretation in Bayesian active learning. This tighter bound increases the probability of achieving nearly zero error.
The paper includes experimental results involving various acquisition scenarios. In these experiments, GBALD outperforms other methods such as BALD, BatchBALD, and other baseline approaches. Notably, GBALD achieves significant accuracy improvements over these alternatives, even when perturbing noisy and repeated samples slightly.
In summary, the paper introduces the concept of geometric Bayesian active learning by disagreements (GBALD), which leverages an ellipsoid-based core-set construction to improve active learning performance compared to traditional approaches. The authors provide a theoretical basis for the improvements and demonstrate their efficacy through experiments in various acquisition scenarios.

Write an introduction to an essay, "Geometric Bayesian Active Models" about these topics and the following:

Geometric Interpretation of Probability Distributions (Inspired by Michael Larionov)
Bayesian inference operates on the idea that the underlying distribution of data is unknown, thus requiring iterative model adjustment as new data is acquired. This can be seen as a geometric process, where the distribution and its parameters shape the landscape in which probability is explored.

In parametric Bayesian inference, we start with a chosen form of a probability distribution 
���
(
���
;
��
)
f(x;��) defined by parameters 
��
��. A common example is the Normal distribution with two parameters 
���
�� (mean) and 
���
2
�� 
2
  (variance). The likelihood of the data given a hypothetical distribution, assuming independent data examples, is represented as:
���
(
��
)
=
���
���
���
(
���
���
;
��
)
l(��)=��� 
i
���
 f(x 
i
���
 ;��)

This mathematical expression can be visualized geometrically as a multidimensional landscape where each point represents a possible configuration of the parameters 
��
��, and the elevation represents the likelihood of the data given those parameters.

The Geometric Landscape: The likelihood function forms a surface in a multidimensional space. Peaks in this landscape correspond to parameter values that are highly likely given the observed data.

Iterative Adjustment: As new data comes in, the landscape shifts, and the peak of likelihood may move. This is akin to navigating a changing terrain, adjusting your position as the landscape reveals itself.

Prior Beliefs: Bayesian inference incorporates prior beliefs about the parameters, which can be seen as a pre-existing shape of the landscape. The prior belief about the distribution influences the starting point and direction of the search for the most likely parameters.

Posterior Distribution: After incorporating the data, the posterior distribution reflects the updated landscape. It is a synthesis of the prior beliefs and the likelihood informed by the data, resulting in a new geometric shape that encapsulates our updated understanding.

Connection to Other Themes: The geometric interpretation of Bayesian probability ties together many of the themes mentioned earlier in the essay, providing a mathematical and visual framework for understanding complex human and technological phenomena.

Conclusion 
The geometric interpretation of Bayesian probability adds a tangible and intuitive layer to our understanding of uncertainty, decision-making, learning, and adaptation. By visualizing the intricate process of Bayesian inference as a dynamically evolving landscape, we can draw parallels across various domains and see connections between human intuition, machine learning, professional evolution, and even societal belief systems. Geometric Bayesianism serves as an elegant unifying concept that brings coherence to a complex and interconnected world.

"Geometric Bayesian Active Models"
In the realm of probabilistic reasoning and decision-making, the marriage of geometry and Bayesian principles introduces a fresh perspective that unveils the intricate landscape of uncertainty, learning, and adaptation. This essay embarks on a journey to explore the fascinating concept of Geometric Bayesian Active Models, a framework that melds geometric interpretation with Bayesian probability theory to illuminate the dynamics of complex phenomena across diverse domains. Drawing inspiration from the work of Michael Larionov and other influential thinkers, this essay delves into the geometric interpretation of probability distributions, showcasing how it provides a visual and mathematical framework for understanding the nuances of Bayesian inference and active learning.
At its core, Bayesian inference relies on the notion that the true distribution underlying observed data is inherently unknown. As new data emerges, the Bayesian framework continually adjusts its model to align with this evolving reality. In a captivating parallel, this iterative process of model adaptation mirrors the notion of navigating through a geometric landscape. The distribution's parameters shape this landscape, where each point signifies a potential configuration of parameters, and the elevation reflects the likelihood of the data given those parameter values.
Parametric Bayesian inference, exemplified by distributions like the Normal distribution, encapsulates this process. The likelihood of data given a hypothetical distribution paints a geometric picture where peaks and valleys mirror the plausibility of parameter configurations. Peaks correspond to parameter values that are highly probable given the observed data, while valleys indicate less likely configurations.
As new data enters the scene, the landscape undergoes a metamorphosis. Just as an explorer adjusts their course as the terrain evolves, Bayesian inference adapts the model to align with new insights. This iterative adjustment corresponds to the dynamic shifting of peaks and valleys on the landscape, a reflection of the changing likelihood of parameter configurations.
Yet, this is not a journey taken blindly. Bayesian inference incorporates prior beliefs into the exploration process. These prior beliefs sculpt the initial landscape before data assimilation, serving as the pre-existing terrain that influences the trajectory of exploration. The landscape's starting point and direction are thus guided by these prior beliefs, adding a profound layer of complexity to the adaptation process.
Once the data is integrated, the updated landscape takes shape as the posterior distribution. This new landscape amalgamates the prior beliefs with the likelihood informed by the data, resulting in a geometric synthesis that encapsulates the current understanding. Just as a skilled cartographer crafts a detailed map from ever-evolving terrain, the Bayesian framework crafts the posterior distribution from the interplay of prior beliefs and observed data.
This geometric interpretation of Bayesian probability resonates across a spectrum of themes explored earlier in this essay. It weaves together insights from technological disruption, trust dynamics, human-machine interfaces, professional evolution, and more. The geometric lens offers a harmonizing framework, allowing us to view complex human and technological interactions through a singular mathematical and visual perspective.
In conclusion, the marriage of geometry and Bayesian probability in the form of Geometric Bayesian Active Models sheds light on the intricate dance between uncertainty, decision-making, learning, and adaptation. By visualizing Bayesian inference as a dynamic landscape, this concept enhances our understanding of the interwoven threads that shape our complex world. As a unifying force, Geometric Bayesianism offers an elegant lens through which to explore the intricate web of human intuition, technological advancement, and societal paradigms. Through this lens, we gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty and coherence that underlie the complexities of our universe.

1. Effect of Different Kernel Functions in SVMs on Decision Boundaries:
The choice of kernel function in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) affects the shape and flexibility of the decision boundaries. Here's a summary of how different kernel functions impact the decision boundaries:

a. Linear Kernel: The linear kernel defines a linear decision boundary. It is suitable when the data is linearly separable. The decision boundary is a hyperplane in the input space.

b. Polynomial Kernel: The polynomial kernel allows for curved decision boundaries. The degree of the polynomial determines the flexibility of the decision boundary. Higher degrees can make decision boundaries more complex and prone to overfitting.

c. Gaussian (RBF) Kernel: The Gaussian kernel creates decision boundaries that are non-linear and can be highly flexible. It uses a similarity measure based on the Gaussian distribution. The shape and width of the Gaussian kernel influence the smoothness and localization of the decision boundary.

d. Sigmoid Kernel: The sigmoid kernel produces decision boundaries that are S-shaped. It is useful for problems that are not linearly separable. The sigmoid kernel maps the data to a higher-dimensional space, and the decision boundary is formed by a hyperplane in that space.

The choice of kernel function depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. The goal is to select a kernel that can capture the underlying patterns and separate the classes effectively without overfitting or underfitting.

2. Other NLP Tasks where Self-Attention Mechanisms have been Successfully Applied:
In addition to the tasks mentioned earlier, self-attention mechanisms have been successfully applied to various other NLP tasks, including:

a. Named Entity Recognition (NER): NER involves identifying and classifying named entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations) within text. Self-attention helps capture contextual information and dependencies between words, aiding in accurate entity recognition.

b. Text Summarization: Self-attention has been used in abstractive and extractive text summarization. By attending to important parts of the input text, self-attention enables the model to generate concise and informative summaries.

c. Natural Language Inference (NLI): NLI tasks involve determining the logical relationship between pairs of sentences, such as entailment, contradiction, or neutrality. Self-attention helps capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between words, improving the accuracy of NLI models.

d. Document Classification: Self-attention has been applied to document classification tasks, where the model needs to understand the overall context and semantics of a document. By attending to relevant parts of the document, self-attention enhances the model's ability to classify accurately.

3. Using Geometrical Representation of Quantum States to Study Entanglement:
The geometrical representation of quantum states provides a framework to study entanglement, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. Entanglement refers to the correlation and non-local connections between quantum systems, even when they are separated by large distances.

In the geometrical representation, entanglement between quantum states is associated with the concept of entanglement entropy. Entanglement entropy measures the amount of entanglement present in a quantum system. It is related to the geometric properties of the quantum state's representation within the Hilbert space.

The geometrical representation allows researchers to study the geometry of entangled states and quantify their entanglement properties. For example, the entanglement entropy can be used to measure the complexity or amount of entanglement in a given quantum state. Measures such as von Neumann entropy, concurrence, or negativity are commonly used to quantify entanglement.

By analyzing the geometrical properties and entanglement measures, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of entangled quantum systems, understand the dynamics of entanglement, and explore its applications in quantum information processing tasks such as quantum communication and quantum computing.
