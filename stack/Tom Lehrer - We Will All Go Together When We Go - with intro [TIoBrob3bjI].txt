I always like to end on a positive note, so here is a rousing, uplifting song which is
guaranteed to cheer you up.
When you attend a funeral, it is sad to think that sooner or later those you love will do
the same for you.
And you may have thought it tragic, not to mention other adjectives to think of all the
weeping they will do, but don't you worry, no more ashes, no more sackcloth, and an armband
made of black cloth will someday nevermore adorn a sleeve.
For if the bomb that drops on you gets your friends and neighbors too, there'll be nobody
left behind to grieve, and we will all go together when we go.
What a comforting fact that is to know, universal bereavement and inspiring achievement, yes
we all will go together when we go.
We will all go together when we go, all suffused with an incandescent glow, no one will have
the endurance to collect on his insurance, Lloyds of London will be loaded when they
go.
We will all fry together when we fry, we'll be french fried potatoes by and by, there
will be no more misery when the world is our rotisserie, yes we all will fry together when
we fry.
We will all bake together when we bake, there'll be nobody present at the wake, with complete
participation in that brand incineration, nearly three billion hunks of well done steak.
We will all char together when we char, and let there be no moaning of the bar, just sing
out a tedium when you see that ICBM, and the party will become as you are.
We will all burn together when we burn, there'll be no need to stand and wait your turn, when
it's time for the fallout and Saint Peter calls us all out, we'll just drop our agendas
and adjourn, we will all go together when we go, every hot and taut and every eskimo,
when the air becomes uranius, we will all go simultaneous, yes we all will go together
when we all go together, yes we all will go together when we go.
