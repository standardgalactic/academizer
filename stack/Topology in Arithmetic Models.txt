The webpage you provided is from the blog of Joel David Hamkins, a mathematician and philosopher specializing in the infinite. The specific post you referred to is titled "Topological models of arithmetic," dated August 5, 2018. This post discusses a research paper co-authored by A. Enayat, J. D. Hamkins, and B. Wcis��o, which is focused on the intersection of topology and arithmetic.
In this research, the authors explore whether nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic (PA) can be represented with continuous functions on the rationals. They affirmatively answer this question, showing that every countable model of PA can indeed have such a continuous presentation. Furthermore, they investigate various topological spaces as potential models for this kind of arithmetic representation. They find that while some spaces like the reals in any finite dimension, the long line, the Cantor space, and any Suslin line do not fit these criteria, many other spaces do. The status of the Baire space in this context remains an open question.
The paper represents an interesting blend of topology, a branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, and arithmetic, particularly focusing on the structure and properties of the set of integers. This research contributes to our understanding of how mathematical concepts can intersect and inform each other in complex and unexpected ways.

Main Question. (Enayat, 2009) Are there continuous functions 
���
 and 
���
 on the rational numbers 
Q
, such that 
���
Q
,
���
,
���
���
 is a nonstandard model of arithmetic?

By a model of arithmetic, what we mean here is a model of the first-order Peano axioms PA, although we also consider various weakenings of this theory. The theory PA asserts of a structure 
���
M
,
+
,
���
���
 that it is the non-negative part of a discretely ordered ring, plus the induction principle for assertions in the language of arithmetic. The natural numbers 
���
N
,
+
,
���
���
, for example, form what is known as the standard model of PA, but there are also many nonstandard models, including continuum many non-isomorphic countable models.

We answer the question affirmatively, and indeed, the main theorem shows that every countable model of PA is continuously presented on 
Q
. We define generally that a topological model of arithmetic is a topological space 
X
 equipped with continuous functions 
���
 and 
���
, for which 
���
X

 satisfies the desired arithmetic theory. In such a case, we shall say that the underlying space 
X
 continuously supports a model of arithmetic and that the model is continuously presented upon the space

The main question you're referencing from the post by Joel David Hamkins and his co-authors, Ali Enayat and Bartosz Wcis��o, pertains to the field of mathematical logic, specifically the intersection of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, with topology. The question they posed is:
"Are there continuous functions ��� and ��� on the rational numbers Q, such that ���Q, ���, ������ is a nonstandard model of arithmetic?"
This question explores the possibility of constructing a model of the first-order Peano axioms (PA) using the set of rational numbers (Q) and two continuous operations (��� and ���). The Peano axioms are a set of axioms for the natural numbers, and a model of these axioms is a structure that satisfies these axioms. The standard model of PA is the set of natural numbers N with the usual addition and multiplication operations. However, there are many nonstandard models of PA, which behave differently from the natural numbers in some respects.
In their research, the authors affirmatively answer their question. They show that every countable model of PA can be continuously presented on the rational numbers Q. This means that for each countable model of arithmetic, there are continuous functions that can be used to construct a structure over the rationals that satisfies the axioms of PA.
A "topological model of arithmetic," as defined by the authors, is a topological space equipped with continuous functions ��� and ���, where the structure ���X, ���, ������ satisfies the desired arithmetic theory. If such a model can be constructed on a space X, it is said that X continuously supports a model of arithmetic and that the model is continuously presented upon X.
This research contributes significantly to the understanding of how arithmetic structures can be realized in different mathematical settings, particularly in topological spaces, broadening the scope of model theory and its applications in understanding the foundations of mathematics.

Question. Which topological spaces support a topological model of arithmetic?

In the paper, we prove that the reals 
R
, the reals in any finite dimension 
R
n
, the long line and Cantor space do not support a topological model of arithmetic, and neither does any Suslin line. Meanwhile, there are many other spaces that do support topological models, including many uncountable subspaces of the plane 
R
2
. It remains an open question whether any uncountable Polish space, including the Baire space, can support a topological model of arithmetic.

Let me state the main theorem and briefly sketch the proof.

This phenomenon amounts exactly to the continuity of addition and multiplication with respect to what we call the final-digits topology on 
N
, which is the topology having basic open sets 
U
s
, the set of numbers whose binary representations ends with the digits 
s
, for any finite binary string 
s
. (One can do a similar thing with any base.) In the 
U
s
 notation, we include the number that would arise by deleting initial 
0
s from 
s
; for example, 
6

U
00110
. Addition and multiplication are continuous in this topology, because if 
x

y

s

x

(

 has an open neighborhood in the final-digits product space, whose image under the sum or product, respectively, is contained in

The question you're referring to from the paper by Joel David Hamkins and his colleagues addresses which topological spaces can support a topological model of arithmetic. In their research, they explored this topic extensively and made several significant findings:
Spaces That Do Not Support a Topological Model of Arithmetic

The real numbers
R
R
R

The reals in any finite dimension
R
n

The long line,

. However, whether any uncountable Polish space, including the Baire space, can support a topological model of arithmetic remains an open question.
Main Theorem - Continuous Presentation on the Rationals
: A key result of their work is that every countable model of PA (Peano arithmetic) has a continuous presentation on the rationals
Q
Q
Q
. This theorem is significant because it demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of mathematical structures like PA in different topological contexts.
Proof of the Main Theorem
: The proof of this theorem relies on what the authors describe as the "final-digits topology" on the natural numbers
N
N
N
. This topology is defined by having basic open sets corresponding to numbers whose binary representations end with certain digits. The authors illustrate this with the familiar school-child method of computing integer sums and products, where the final digits of the result are determined by the final digits of the inputs. This phenomenon reflects the continuity of addition and multiplication in this topology.
The research presented in this paper offers a fascinating intersection of topology, model theory, and arithmetic, expanding the understanding of how arithmetic structures can be represented and analyzed in various topological spaces. The results contribute to the broader field of mathematical logic, highlighting the richness and complexity of mathematical structures and their interactions.

Let us make several elementary observations about the topology. The sets 
U
s
 do indeed form the basis of a topology, because 
U
s
���
U
t
 is empty, if 
s
 and 
t
 disagree on some digit (comparing from the right), or else it is either 
U
s
 or 
U
t
, depending on which sequence is longer. The topology is Hausdorff, because different numbers are distinguished by sufficiently long segments of final digits. There are no isolated points, because every basic open set 
U
s
 has infinitely many elements. Every basic open set 
U
s
 is clopen, since the complement of 
U
s
 is the union of 
U
t
, where 
t
 conflicts on some digit with 
s
. The topology is actually the same as the metric topology generated by the 
2
-adic valuation, which assigns the distance between two numbers as 
2
���
k
, when 
k
 is largest such that 
2
k
 divides their difference; the set 
U
s
 is an open ball in this metric, centered at the number represented by 
s
. (One can also see that it is metric by the Urysohn metrization theorem, since it is a Hausdorff space with a countable clopen basis, and therefore regular.) By a theorem of Sierpinski, every countable metric space without isolated points is homeomorphic to the rational line 
Q
, and so we conclude that the final-digits topology on 
N
 is homeomorphic to 
Q
. We���ve therefore proved that the standard model of arithmetic 
N has a continuous presentation on 
Q, as desired.

The observations you're referring to from the paper provide a deeper insight into the topology under consideration for constructing a topological model of arithmetic. These observations highlight several key properties of the "final-digits topology" on the natural numbers
N

Basis of Topology

form the basis of this topology. The intersection

Hausdorff Property
: The topology is Hausdorff, meaning that any two distinct points (numbers in this case) can be separated by disjoint open sets. This separation is achieved through the identification of different numbers by their sufficiently long segments of final digits.
No Isolated Points
: The topology has no isolated points, as each basic open set
U

contains infinitely many elements. This implies that the space is densely packed without any 'lonely' points.

Q

, using this final-digits topology. This result not only shows the versatility of mathematical structures but also provides a novel way to understand and visualize them within the realm of topology.
You
But let us belabor the argument somewhat, since we find it interesting to notice that the final-digits topology (or equivalently, the 
2
-adic metric topology on 
N
) is precisely the order topology of a certain definable order on 
N
, what we call the final-digits order, an endless dense linear order, which is therefore order-isomorphic and thus also homeomorphic to the rational line 
Q
, as desired.

Specifically, the final-digits order on the natural numbers, pictured in figure 1, is the order induced from the lexical order on the finite binary representations, but considering the digits from right-to-left, giving higher priority in the lexical comparison to the low-value final digits of the number. To be precise, the final-digits order 
n
���
m
 holds, if at the first point of disagreement (from the right) in their binary representation, 
n
 has 
0
 and 
m
 has 
1
; or if there is no disagreement, because one of them is longer, then the longer number is lower, if the next digit is 
0
, and higher, if it is 
1
 (this is not the same as treating missing initial digits as zero). Thus, the even numbers appear as the left half of the order, since their final digit is 
0
, and the odd numbers as the right half, since their final digit is 
1
, and 
0
 is directly in the middle; indeed, the highly even numbers, whose representations end with a lot of zeros, appear further and further to the left, while the highly odd numbers, which end with many ones, appear further and further to the right. If one does not allow initial 
0
s in the binary representation of numbers, then note that zero is represented in binary by the empty sequence. It is evident that the final-digits order is an endless dense linear order on 
N, just as the corresponding lexical order on finite binary strings is an endless dense linear order.

The further elaboration you mentioned from the paper delves into an interesting aspect of the topology being discussed: the final-digits topology on the natural numbers
N
N
N
, which is equivalent to the 2-adic metric topology, can also be viewed through the lens of a specific order on
N
N
N
. This perspective provides a different yet equally compelling way to understand the structure of this topological space. Let's break down this argument:
Final-Digits Order
: This is a particular way of ordering the natural numbers based on their binary representation, considering digits from right to left (the least significant to the most significant). This order prioritizes the lower-value final digits in lexical comparison.
Ordering Rules
:
If two numbers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
first disagree on a digit when read from right to left, and
n
n
n
has a 0 while
m
m
m
has a 1 at this digit, then
n
n
n
is considered smaller than
m
m
m
in this order.
If one number is longer than the other (and thus has more leading digits), the longer number is considered:
Smaller if the next digit (immediately after the common part) is 0.
Larger if the next digit is 1.
Structure of the Order
:
Even numbers end in 0 and thus appear on the left half of this order.
Odd numbers end in 1 and appear on the right half.
Numbers ending with many zeros (highly even numbers) are further to the left.
Numbers ending with many ones (highly odd numbers) are further to the right.
Zero, represented by an empty sequence in binary, is in the middle of this order.
Endless Dense Linear Order
: The final-digits order on
N
N
N
creates an endless dense linear order, similar to the lexical order on finite binary strings. This means there are no gaps in the order, and between any two elements, there are other elements of the set.
Homeomorphism to the Rational Line
Q
Q
Q
: Since the final-digits order on
N
N
N
forms an endless dense linear order, it is order-isomorphic and thus homeomorphic to the rational line
Q
Q
Q
. This is significant because it provides another perspective to demonstrate that the standard model of arithmetic
N
N
N
has a continuous presentation on
Q
Q
Q
, as the final-digits order generates a topology that is equivalent to the final-digits topology.
This approach of looking at the order properties of the natural numbers and connecting them to topological concepts highlights the deep interplay between different areas of mathematics, such as number theory, topology, and order theory. It enriches the understanding of how seemingly simple structures like the natural numbers can be viewed through various mathematical lenses, revealing complex and intricate relationships.

The basic open set 
U
s
 of numbers having final digits 
s
 is an open set in this order, since any number ending with 
s
 is above a number with binary form 
100
���
0
s
 and below a number with binary form 
11
���
1
s
 in the final-digits order; so 
U
s
 is a union of intervals in the final-digits order. Conversely, every interval in the final-digits order is open in the final-digits topology, because if 
n
���
x
���
m
, then this is determined by some final segment of the digits of 
x
 (appending initial 
0
s if necessary), and so there is some 
U
s
 containing 
x
 and contained in the interval between 
n
 and 
m
. Thus, the final-digits topology is the precisely same as the order topology of the final-digits order, which is a definable endless dense linear order on 
N
. Since this order is isomorphic and hence homeomorphic to the rational line 
Q

We now complete the proof by considering an arbitrary countable model

M
 be the final-digits order as defined inside 
M

M
 can see that its addition and multiplication are continuous with respect to the order topology of its final-digits order. Since 
M
 is countable, the final-digits order of

The executive summary of the proof is: the arithmetic of the standard model 
N
 is continuous with respect to the final-digits topology, which is the same as the 
2
-adic metric topology on 
N
, and this is homeomorphic to the rational line, because it is the order topology of the final-digits order, a definable endless dense linear order; applied in a nonstandard model 
M
, this observation means the arithmetic of 
M
 is continuous with respect to its rational line 
Q
M
, which for countable models is isomorphic to the actual rational line 
Q
, and so such an 
M
 is continuously presentable upon 
Q
.

Let me mention the following order, which it seems many people expect to use instead of the final-digits order as we defined it above. With this order, one in effect takes missing initial digits of a number as 
0
, which is of course quite reasonable.

The problem with this order, however, is that the order topology is not actually the final-digits topology. For example, the set of all numbers having final digits 
110
 in this order has a least element, the number 
6
, and so it is not open in the order topology. Worse, I claim that arithmetic is not continuous with respect to this order. For example, 
1
+
1
=
2
, and 
2
 has an open neighborhood consisting entirely of even numbers, but every open neighborhood of 
1
 has both odd and even numbers, whose sums therefore will not all be in the selected neighborhood of 
2
. Even the successor function 
x
���
x
+
1
 is not continuous with respect to this order.

Finally, let me mention that a version of the main theorem also applies to the integers 
Z
, using the following order.

However, this order does not work for the purposes of the theorem because its order topology is not equivalent to the final-digits topology. For instance, in this alternative order, the set of all numbers with final digits 110 has a least element (the number 6), making it not open in the order topology. Furthermore, arithmetic operations (including the successor function) are not continuous with respect to this alternative order.

TOPOLOGICAL MODELS OF ARITHMETIC 
ALI ENAYAT, JOEL DAVID HAMKINS, AND BARTOSZ WCIS LO 
Abstract. Ali Enayat had asked whether there is a model of PA (Peano Arithmetic) that 
can be represented as hQ,���,���i, where ��� and ��� are continuous functions on the rationals 
Q. We prove, af i rmatively, that indeed every countable model of PA has such a continuous 
presentation on the rationals. More generally, we investigate the topological spaces that 
arise as such topological models of arithmetic. Finite dimensional Euclidean spaces Rn, 
and compact Hausdorf f spaces do not, and neither does any Suslin line; many other spaces 
do. The status of the space of irrationals remains open. 
1. Introduction 
This paper arose from the following question that asks whether a model of arithmetic 
could be continuously presented on the rational numbers (the motivation for this question is 
explained in Remark 17). 
Main Question 1 (Enayat [Ena09]). Are there continuous functions ��� and ��� on the rational 
numbers Q, such that hQ,���,���i is a model of PA ? 
PA (Peano Arithmetic) consists of the i rst order theory PA���of the non-negative parts of 
discretely ordered rings, plus the induction principle for assertions in the i rst order language 
of arithmetic. The natural numbers hN,+,��i form what is known as the standard model of 
PA, but there are also many nonstandard models, including continuum many non-isomorphic 
countable models. Although we take PA as a central case, most of our arguments do not 
use the full strength of PA, and our analysis applies to models of various weaker arithmetic 
theories. Consequently throughout the paper, we use the expression ���a model of arithmetic��� 
to refer to a model of a suf i ciently strong fragment of PA. The fragments that appear in 
the results of this paper are: Successor Arithmetic (the i rst order theory of hN,0,Si, where 
S(x) = x+1), Presburger Arithmetic (the i rst order theory of hN,+i), PA���, 
IOpen (PA���plus 
induction axioms for quantif i er free formulas), I���0(PA���plus induction axioms for bounded 
formulas), I���0+ Exp (where Exp asserts the totality of the exponential function), and I��1 
(PA���plus induction axioms for existential (��1) formulas). We refer the reader to [HP98] and 
[Kay91] for general background on arithmetical theories and their model theory. 
We shall answer the main question af i rmatively, and indeed, our main theorem (theorem 5) 
shows that every countable model of I���0is continuously presented on Q. We def i ne generally 
that a topological model of arithmetic is a topological space X equipped with continuous 
functions ��� and ���, for which hX,���,���i satisf i es the desired arithmetic theory. In such a case, 
we shall say that the underlying space X continuously supports a model of arithmetic and 
that the model is continuously presented on/upon the space X.

Scope Beyond Full PA
: While PA is central to their discussion, the authors note that most of their arguments do not require the full strength of PA. They apply their analysis to models of various weaker arithmetic theories, such as Successor Arithmetic, Presburger Arithmetic, PA���, IOpen, I��0, I��0+ Exp, and I��1.

Question 2. Which topological spaces support a topological model of arithmetic? 
In section 3, we shall prove that many familiar topological spaces do not support models of 
arithmetic. The list of such spaces includes every i nite dimensional Euclidean space Rn, the 
long line, the Cantor space, and Suslin lines. Meanwhile, there are many other spaces that 
do support topological models, including many uncountable subspaces of the plane R2. It 
remains an open question whether any uncountable Polish space, including the Baire space, 
can support a topological model of arithmetic. 
In light of our answer to the main question in the case of Q, where we showed not only that 
some models of PA are continuously presented on Q, but that all countable models of PA can 
be continuously presented on Q���and the same is true of the indiscrete and discrete spaces���it 
seems natural to ask whether this none/all phenomenon continues with other spaces. 
Question 3. If a topological space X continuously supports a model of PA, then does X 
continuously support a copy of every model of PA of that cardinality? 
We answer question 3 negatively in theorem 30, showing that in every inf i nite cardinality, 
there are spaces that continuously support some, but not all models of arithmetic in that 
cardinality. Thus, the underlying topology is able to distinguish the arithmetic structure. 
One might similarly ask whether it can distinguish the arithmetic theory of the structures. 
Question 4. If a topological space X continuously supports a model of PA, then does it 
continuously support a model of every completion of PA? 
We also answer question 4 negatively in corollary 32, although the question remains

The questions and discussions you've highlighted from the paper focus on which topological spaces can support topological models of arithmetic, particularly models of Peano Arithmetic (PA). Here are the key points for each question:
Question 2: Which Topological Spaces Support a Topological Model of Arithmetic?

Open Question
: The paper leaves open whether any uncountable Polish space, such as the Baire space, can support a topological model of arithmetic.
Question 3: Does a Space Supporting One Model of PA Support All Models of That Cardinality?
Answer
: The authors answer this question negatively. In theorem 30, they show that in every infinite cardinality, there are spaces that continuously support some, but not all, models of arithmetic of that cardinality. This implies that the underlying topology can distinguish between different arithmetic structures.
Question 4: Does a Space Supporting a Model of PA Support All Completions of PA?
Answer
: This question is also answered negatively (in corollary 32), suggesting that the topology can distinguish not just between different models of a given arithmetic theory but also between different completions of that theory. However, the full exploration of this question remains open.
These questions and their answers deepen the understanding of the relationship between topology and arithmetic models. They explore how different topological structures can accommodate or limit the representation of arithmetic theories, shedding light on the intricate ways in which mathematical theories interact with each other. The paper's findings highlight that while some topological spaces are versatile enough to support various models of arithmetic, others are more restrictive, indicating a fascinating interplay between topological properties and arithmetic structures.

2. Every countable model is continuously presented on the rationals 
In this section we prove the main theorem, part (a) of which answers the main question. A 
soft argument can be used to show that part (b) of the main theorem implies part (a) of the 
theorem (more specif i cally, this follows from the line of reasoning used to prove lemma 20). 
However, for clarity of exposition we found it preferable to establish (a) in full detail, and 
then explain the i ne tuning that is needed to establish (b). Let us also point out that later in 
theorem 25, we show that each countable model of arithmetic also lends itself to continuous 
presentations on metric spaces obtained by augmenting the rationals Q with a prescribed 
i nite or countable number of isolated points. In contrast, as noted in remark 24, if the ring 
ZMof a model M of arithmetic admits a continuous presentation on a countable metric space 
X, then either X is homeomorphic to the discrete space N, or X is homeomorphic to the 
rationals Q. 
Main Theorem 5. Let M be a countable model of the fragment I���0of PA. 
(a) M admits a continuous presentation on the rationals Q. 
(b) The ring of integers ZMof M admits a continuous presentation on the rationals Q. 
Proof. (a). We shall prove (a) i rst for the standard model of arithmetic hN,+,��i. Every 
school child knows that when computing integer sums and products by the usual algorithms, 
the i nal digits of the result x + y or x �� y are completely determined by the corresponding 
i nal digits of the inputs x and y. Presented with only i nal segments of the input, the child 
TOPOLOGICAL MODELS OF ARITHMETIC3 
can nevertheless proceed to compute the corresponding i nal segments of the sum or product.

������414������3783 
������6305

This phenomenon amounts exactly to the continuity of addition and multiplication with 
respect to what we call the i nal-digits topology on N, which is the topology having basic open 
sets Us, the set of numbers whose binary representations end with the digits s, for any i nite 
binary string s. (A similar idea can be used with any base, although the topologies can dif f er.) 
In the Usnotation, we include the number that would arise by deleting initial 0s from s; for 
example, 6 ��� U00110. 
Addition and multiplication are continuous in this topology, because 
if x + y or x �� y has i nal digits s, then by the school-child���s observation, this is ensured by 
corresponding i nal digits in x and y, and so (x,y) has an open neighborhood in the i nal-digits 
product space, whose image under the sum or product, respectively, is contained in Us. 
Let us make several elementary observations about the topology. The sets Usdo indeed 
form the basis of a topology, because Us��� Utis 
empty, if s and t disagree on some digit 
(comparing from the right), or else it is either Usor Ut, depending on which sequence is 
longer. The topology is Hausdorf f , because dif f erent numbers are distinguished by suf i ciently 
long segments of i nal digits. There are no isolated points, because every basic open set Us 
has inf i nitely many elements. Every basic open set Usis clopen, since the complement of Us 
is the union of Ut, where t conf l icts on some digit with s. The topology is actually the same 
as the metric topology generated by the 2-adic valuation, which assigns the distance between 
two numbers as 2���k, when k is largest such that 2kdivides their dif f erence; the set Usis an 
open ball in this metric, centered at the number represented by s and of radius 2���|s|. (One 
can also see that it is metric by the Urysohn metrization theorem [Mun00, theorem 34.1], 
since it is a Hausdorf f space with a countable clopen basis, and therefore regular.) By a 
theorem of Sierpi�� nski [Sie20; Fra12], every countable metric space without isolated points is 
homeomorphic to the rational line Q, and so we conclude that the i nal-digits topology on N 
is homeomorphic to Q. We���ve therefore proved that the standard model of arithmetic N has 
a continuous presentation on Q, as desired.

Question 33. If M is a model of arithmetic, and N is a model continuously presented with 
respect to the initial-segment topology of M, then must M and N have the same order type? 
Is this true for ��-like models M? 
The i nal argument of corollary 32 shows the answer is af i rmative when �� = ��. More 
generally, the same argument shows that if N is continuous with respect to the initial-segment 
topology of a model M, then the two models must have the same 0, the same 1 and so on 
through the standard part. The question is asking whether the pattern continues above this, 
so that the models have the same initial segments and hence the same order. Theorem 31 
shows that when M is ��-like, then any N presented on the initial-segment topology of M will 
be ��-like, but it does not quite show for uncountable �� that the order of M and N agree or 
that these orders are isomorphic. Note that models of arithmetic can have the same order 
without being isomorphic with respect to their addition and multiplication; for example, all 
countable nonstandard models of PA have the same order type: �� + Z �� Q. 
5. Topological models of arithmetic in the complex numbers 
In this last section, We provide further instances of topological models of arithmetic by 
revisiting the following result which presents uncountable models of arithmetic in the com- 
plex numbers. The result is due to Josef Ml�� cek [Ml�� c73]; see also the second author���s blog 
post [Ham18] 
16ALI ENAYAT, JOEL DAVID HAMKINS, AND BARTOSZ WCIS LO 
Theorem 34. Every model of PA���of size at most continuum has a presentation as a topo- 
logical model, using a subspace of the real plane R2. Indeed, every such model is realized as a 
substructure of the complex numbers hC,+,��i. 
Proof. Suppose that M is a model of PA���of size at most continuum. Consider the integers 
of this model ZM, from which we may take the fraction i eld and then the algebraic closure, 
building a version of the i eld A of algebraic numbers over M.3So A is an algebraically 
closed i eld of characteristic zero, which has an elementary extension to such a i eld of size 
continuum. Since the theory of algebraically closed i elds of characteristic zero is categorical 
in all uncountable powers, it follows that A is isomorphic to a substructure of the complex 
numbers C, and isomorphic to C itself if M has size continuum. Since M is isomorphic to a 
substructure of ZM, which sits inside A, it follows that M is isomorphic to a substructure of 
C, as claimed. Since complex number arithmetic is continuous with respect to the topology 
of the real plane, we thereby realize M as a topological model of arithmetic using this subset 
of R2.? 
In particular, every countable model of PA���can be found as a substructure of the complex 
numbers. The same argument applied at higher cardinals shows that if k is the uncountable 
algebraically closed i eld of characteristic zero, then every model of arithmetic M |= PA���of 
size at most the cardinality of k embeds into k. 
Note that by theorem 18, if M is a ��-like model of arithmetic for some uncountable �� at 
most the continuum, then no subspace of R2that continuously supports M is analytic.

Notions of Monoidal Category
: Monoidal categories generalize tensor products in categories. They involve objects and morphisms equipped with a tensor product operation and an identity object satisfying certain coherence conditions.
Generalized Operads: Further Definitions
: This could refer to extensions or generalizations of classical operad theory, adapting it to more complex or specific situations.
Generalized Operads and Multicategories: Basics
: This suggests a foundational exploration of the basic principles and structures in generalized operads and multicategories.
fc-Generalized Operads
: This term isn't standard, but it might refer to a specific type or approach within the theory of generalized operads.
Opetopes
: Opetopes are higher-dimensional generalizations of polygons and polyhedra, used in higher-dimensional category theory.
Globular Operads
: These are operads defined in terms of globular sets, commonly used in higher category theory, particularly in the study of weak n-categories.

Introduction 
It must be admitted that the use of geometric intuition 
has no logical necessity in mathematics, and is often left 
out of the formal presentation of results. If one had to 
construct a mathematical brain, one would probably use 
resources more ef i ciently than creating a visual system. 
But the system is there already, it is used to great ad- 
vantage by human mathematicians, and it gives a special 
l avor to human mathematics.Ruelle [1999] 
Higher-dimensional category theory is the study of a zoo of exotic structures: 
operads, n-categories, multicategories, monoidal categories, braided monoidal 
categories, and more.It is intertwined with the study of structures such as 
homotopy algebras (A���-categories, L���-algebras, ��-spaces, ...), n-stacks, and n- 
vector spaces, and draws it inspiration from areas as diverse as topology, quantum 
algebra, mathematical physics, logic, and theoretical computer science. 
No surprise, then, that the subject has developed chaotically. The rush to- 
wards formalizing certain commonly-imagined concepts has resulted in an ex- 
traordinary mass of ideas, employing diverse techniques from most of the subject 
areas mentioned. What is needed is a transparent, natural, and practical lan- 
guage in which to express these ideas. 
The main aim of this book is to present one. It is the language of generalized 
operads. It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple descriptions of a 
variety of higher categorical structures. 
I hope that by the end, the reader will be convinced that generalized oper- 
ads provide as appropriate a language for higher-dimensional category theory as 
vector spaces do for linear algebra, or sheaves for algebraic geometry. Indeed, 
the reader may also come to share the feeling that generalized operads are as 
applicable and pervasive in mathematics at large as are n-categories, the usual 
focus of higher-dimensional category theorists. 
Here are some of the structures that we will study, presented informally. 
Let n ��� N. An n-category consists of 0-cells (objects) a,b,..., 1-cells (ar- 
rows) f,g,..., 2-cells (arrows between arrows) ��,��,..., 3-cells (arrows between 
arrows between arrows) ��,���,..., and so on, all the way up to n-cells, together with various composition operations. The cells are usually drawn like this: 
a 
���, a��� 
f- b 
���, a��� 
f 
g 
�� R 
��� b 
���, a��� 
f 
g 
���� 
�� 
y x 
> R 
b 
���,.... 
Typical example: for any topological space X there is an n-category whose k-cells 
are maps from the closed k-dimensional ball into X. A 0-category is just a set, 
and a 1-category just an ordinary category. 
A multicategory consists of objects a,b,..., arrows ��,��,..., a composition 
operation, and identities, just like an ordinary category, the dif f erence being that 
the domain of an arrow is not just a single object but a i nite sequence of them. 
An arrow is therefore drawn as �� 
HH HH 
H 
? 
? 
? 
?? 
a1 
a2 
ak 
. . . 
a 
(where k ��� N), and composition turns a tree of arrows into a single arrow. Vector 
spaces and linear maps form a category; vector spaces and multilinear maps form 
a multicategory. 
An operad is a multicategory with only one object. Explicitly, an operad 
consists of a set P(k) for each k ��� N, whose elements are thought of as ���k-ary 
operations��� and drawn as �� 
HH HH 
H 
? 
? 
? 
?? 
. . . 
with k input wires on the left, together with a rule for composing the operations 
and an identity operation. Example: for any vector space V there is an operad 
whose k-ary operations are the linear maps V ���k- V .

The introduction to Tom Leinster's "Higher Operads, Higher Categories" provides an accessible entry point into the complex and multifaceted world of higher-dimensional category theory. Here are some key points from the introduction:
Role of Geometric Intuition
: Leinster acknowledges the importance of geometric intuition in mathematics, as highlighted by Ruelle [1999]. While not logically necessary, visual systems play a significant role in human mathematical understanding and add a unique flavor to the field.
Scope of Higher-Dimensional Category Theory
: This field involves a diverse array of structures such as operads, n-categories, multicategories, monoidal categories, braided monoidal categories, and more. It is connected to homotopy algebras (like A���-categories, L���-algebras, ��-spaces), n-stacks, and n-vector spaces, drawing inspiration from various areas including topology, quantum algebra, mathematical physics, logic, and theoretical computer science.
Development of the Field
: The subject has evolved chaotically with a rush towards formalizing concepts, resulting in a rich assortment of ideas using techniques from a broad range of disciplines.
Need for a Unified Language
: Leinster emphasizes the need for a transparent, natural, and practical language to express the ideas of higher-dimensional category theory.
Main Aim of the Book
: The book aims to present generalized operads as a language for higher-dimensional category theory, hoping to make the reader see their applicability and pervasiveness in mathematics, much like n-categories.
Informal Presentation of Structures
:
n-Categories
: These consist of cells (0-cells for objects, 1-cells for arrows, etc.) up to n-cells, along with various composition operations. Leinster provides an example of n-categories derived from topological spaces.
Multicategories
: These have objects and arrows like ordinary categories, but the domain of an arrow is a sequence of objects. This concept generalizes to vector spaces and multilinear maps.
Operads
: Defined as multicategories with only one object, operads involve sets of 'k-ary operations' and rules for composing these operations. An example given is the operad of linear maps in the context of vector spaces.
Leinster's introduction sets the stage for a deep dive into these advanced concepts, making the complex field of higher-dimensional category theory more accessible and providing a foundation for the detailed exploration that follows in his book.

Operads describe operations that take a i nite sequence of things as input and 
produce a single thing as output. A i nite sequence is a 1-dimensional entity, so 
operads can be used, for example, to describe the operation of composing a (1- 
dimensional) string of arrows in a (1-)category. But if we are interested in higher- 
dimensional structures such as n-categories then we need a more general notion 
of operad, one where the inputs of an operation can form a higher-dimensional 
shape���a grid, perhaps, or a tree, or a so-called pasting diagram. For each choice 
of ���input type��� T, there is a class of T-operads. A T-operad consists of a family 
of operations whose inputs are of the specif i ed type, together with a rule for 
composition; for instance, if the input type T is ���f i nite sequences��� then a T- 
operad is an ordinary operad. Fig. 0-A shows typical operations �� in a T-operad, for four dif f erent choices of T. Similarly, there are T-multicategories, where 
the shapes at the domain and codomain of arrows are labelled with the names of 
objects. These are the ���generalized operads��� and ���generalized multicategories��� at 
the heart of this book. 
The uniting feature of all these structures is that they are purely algebraic 
in def i nition, yet near-impossible to understand without drawing or visualizing 
pictures. They are inherently geometrical. 
A notorious problem in this subject is the multiplicity of def i nitions of n- 
category. Something like a dozen dif f erent def i nitions have been proposed, and 
there are still very few precise results stating equivalence between any of them. 
This is not quite the scandal it may seem: it is hard to say what ���equivalence��� 
should even mean. Suppose that Professors X and Y each propose a def i nition 
of n-category. To compare their def i nitions, you i nd a way of taking one of X���s 
n-categories and deriving from it one of Y���s n-categories, and vice-versa, then 
you try to show that doing one process then the other gets you back to where 
you started. It is, however, highly unrealistic to expect that you will get back 
to exactly where you started. For most types of mathematical structure, getting 
back to somewhere isomorphic to your starting point would be a reasonable 
expectation. But for n-categories, as we shall see, this is still unrealistic: the 
canonical notion of equivalence of n-categories is much weaker than isomorphism. 
Finding a precise def i nition of equivalence for a given def i nition of n-category can 
be dif i cult. Indeed, many of the proposed def i nitions of n-category did not come 
with accompanying proposed def i nitions of equivalence, and this gap must be 
almost certainly be i lled before any comparison results can be proved.

In this section, Tom Leinster provides a detailed explanation of the role of operads in higher-dimensional category theory, the challenge of defining n-categories, and the importance of visual intuition in understanding these complex structures. Here are the main points:
Operads and Higher-Dimensional Structures
:
Basic Operads
: Operads are algebraic structures that describe operations taking a finite sequence of inputs to produce a single output. These sequences are 1-dimensional, suitable for describing operations like composing a string of arrows in a category.
Generalized Operads for Higher Dimensions
: For higher-dimensional structures like n-categories, more generalized operads are needed. These operads can handle operations where inputs form higher-dimensional shapes like grids, trees, or pasting diagrams.
T-Operads
: For each type of input shape 'T', there is a class of T-operads. A T-operad consists of operations with inputs of the specified type T and a rule for their composition.
Generalized Multicategories
:
In T-multicategories, the domain and codomain of arrows are shaped and labeled with object names. These represent the "generalized operads" and "generalized multicategories" central to the book.
Algebraic Definitions and Geometrical Intuition
:
These structures, though algebraic in definition, are nearly impossible to understand without visual representations. This highlights the inherently geometrical nature of these concepts.
Multiplicity of Definitions for n-Categories
:
A major challenge in the field is the numerous definitions proposed for n-categories, with little consensus or clear equivalence between them.
Comparing Definitions: To compare different definitions, one would typically try to transform an n-category from one definition to another and then back, hoping to end up at the original point or at least at something isomorphic.
Unrealistic Expectations: For n-categories, even achieving isomorphism upon this round-trip transformation is considered unrealistic. The canonical notion of equivalence for n-categories is much weaker than isomorphism.
Challenges in Defining Equivalence
:
Defining equivalence for a given definition of n-category is difficult. Many proposed definitions of n-category lack accompanying definitions of equivalence, making it hard to compare or validate them.
Leinster's exposition underlines the complexity and the abstract nature of higher-dimensional category theory, emphasizing the necessity of both rigorous algebraic definitions and intuitive geometric representations. The discussion about the multiplicity of definitions and the difficulty in establishing equivalence among them reflects the ongoing challenges and the dynamic nature of research in this field.

Is this all ���just language���? There would be no shame if it were: language can 
have the most profound ef f ect. New language can make new concepts thinkable, 
and make old, apparently obscure, concepts suddenly seem natural and obvious. 
But there is no clear line between mathematical language and ���real��� mathematics. 
For example, we will see that a 3-category with only one 0-cell and one 1-cell 
is precisely a braided monoidal category, and that the free braided monoidal 
category on one object is the sequence (Bn)n���Nof braid groups. So if n-categories 
are just language, not ���real��� mathematical objects, then the same is true of the 
viiiIntroduction 
braid groups, which describe conf i gurations of knotted string. The distinction 
begins to look meaningless. 
Here is a summary of the contents. 
Motivation for topologists 
Topology and higher-dimensional category theory are intimately related. The 
diagrams that one cannot help drawing when thinking about higher categorical 
structures can very often be taken literally as pieces of topology. We start with 
an informal discussion of the connections between the two subjects. This includes 
various topological examples of n-categories, and an account of how the world of 
n-categories is a mirror of the world of homotopy groups of spheres. 
Part I: Background 
We will build on various ���classical��� notions. Those traditionally considered the 
domain of category theorists are in Chapter 1: ordinary categories, bicategories, 
strict n-categories, and enrichment. Classical operads and multicategories have 
Chapter 2 to themselves. They should be viewed as categorical structures too, 
although, anomalously, operads are best known to homotopy theorists and mul- 
ticategories to categorical logicians. 
The familiar concept of monoidal (tensor) category can be formulated in a 
remarkable number of dif f erent ways.We look at several in Chapter 3, and 
prove them equivalent. Monoidal categories can be identif i ed with one-object 
2-categories, so this is a microcosm of the comparison of dif f erent def i nitions of 
n-category.

Tom Leinster in "Higher Operads, Higher Categories" further explores the significance of mathematical language and its relationship with the essence of 'real' mathematics. Here's a summary of the points covered in this section:
Language vs. 'Real' Mathematics
:
Leinster addresses the question of whether the study of higher-dimensional category theory and structures like n-categories is "just language" or constitutes 'real' mathematics. He argues that language plays a crucial role in mathematics by shaping thought and making complex concepts more accessible and understandable.
He provides an example: a 3-category with only one 0-cell and one 1-cell is equivalent to a braided monoidal category, and the free braided monoidal category on one object corresponds to the sequence of braid groups

Motivation for Topologists
:
Leinster discusses the deep connection between topology and higher-dimensional category theory. The diagrams often used in higher category theory are not just abstract representations but can also be interpreted as actual topological structures.
The section includes topological examples of n-categories and explores the relationship between the world of n-categories and the homotopy groups of spheres.
Part I: Background
:
Chapter 1
: Focuses on classical notions traditionally associated with category theory, such as ordinary categories, bicategories, strict n-categories, and enrichment.
Chapter 2
: Dedicated to classical operads and multicategories, which are recognized as categorical structures but have strong connections to homotopy theory and categorical logic.
Chapter 3
: Explores the concept of monoidal (tensor) categories, showing various formulations and establishing their equivalence. Monoidal categories are related to one-object 2-categories, serving as a small-scale model for understanding different definitions of n-category.
Leinster's approach in this book not only delves into the intricate details of higher-dimensional category theory but also emphasizes the integral role of language in shaping and advancing mathematical thought. By bridging abstract concepts with tangible mathematical structures and showing their applications in fields like topology, he underscores the depth and practicality of these advanced theoretical constructs.

Part II: Operads 
This introduces the central idea of the text: that of generalized (���higher���) operad 
and multicategory. The def i nitions���of generalized operad and multicategory, 
and of algebra for a generalized operad or multicategory���are stated and ex- 
plained in Chapter 4, and some further theory is developed in Chapter 6. 
There is a truly surprising theory of enrichment for generalized multicategories��� 
it is not at all the routine extension of traditional enriched category theory that 
one might expect. This was to have formed Part IV of the book, but for reasons 
of space it was (reluctantly) dropped. A summary of the theory, with pointers 
to the original papers, is in Section 6.8. 
The rest of Part II is made up of examples and applications. Chapter 5 is 
devoted to so-called fc-multicategories, which are generalized multicategories for 
a certain choice of input shape. They turn out to provide a clean setting for 
some familiar categorical constructions that have previously been encumbered 
by technical restrictions. In Chapter 7 we look at opetopic sets, structures anal- 
ogous to simplicial sets and used in the def i nitions of n-category proposed by 
Baez, Dolan, and others. Again, the language of higher operads provides a very clean approach; we also i nd ourselves drawn inexorably into higher-dimensional 
topology. 
Part III: n-Categories 
Using the language of generalized operads, some of the proposed def i nitions of n- 
category are very simple to state. We start by concentrating on one in particular, 
in which an n-category is def i ned as an algebra for a certain globular operad. A 
globular operad is a T-operad for a certain choice of input type T; the associated 
diagrams are complexes of disks, as in the last arrow �� of Fig. 0-A. Chapter 8 
explains what globular operads are in pictorial terms. In Chapter 9 we choose a 
particular globular operad, def i ne an n-category as an algebra for it, and explore 
the implications in some depth. 
The many proposed def i nitions of n-category are not as dissimilar as they 
might at i rst appear.We go through most of them in Chapter 10, drawing 
together the common threads.

In "Higher Operads, Higher Categories," Tom Leinster dives deeper into the concept of operads, particularly focusing on generalized or 'higher' operads and multicategories in Part II of the book. Here's an overview of this part:
Part II: Operads
Introduction of Generalized Operads and Multicategories
:
Chapter 4
: Introduces and explains the definitions of generalized operads and multicategories, along with the concept of algebras for these structures.
Chapter 6
: Further develops the theory, including a surprising approach to enrichment for generalized multicategories. This enrichment theory diverges from traditional enriched category theory, and although initially intended for a separate part (Part IV), it was summarized in Section 6.8 due to space constraints.
Examples and Applications
:
Chapter 5
: Focuses on 'fc-multicategories', a type of generalized multicategory defined for a specific input shape. These structures provide a streamlined framework for certain categorical constructions.
Chapter 7
: Discusses opetopic sets, which are analogous to simplicial sets and used in definitions of n-category by Baez, Dolan, and others. The language of higher operads offers a clean approach to these structures and leads to higher-dimensional topology.
Part III: n-Categories
Simplifying Proposed Definitions of n-Category
:
Using the language of generalized operads, Leinster shows that some definitions of n-category can be stated simply and elegantly.
Chapter 8
: Describes globular operads, a specific type of T-operad, in pictorial terms. These operads use diagrams that resemble complexes of disks.
Chapter 9
: Focuses on a particular globular operad to define an n-category as an algebra for this operad, exploring the implications of this approach.
Chapter 10
: Examines various proposed definitions of n-category, highlighting the common elements among them and showing that they are not as dissimilar as they might initially seem.
Leinster's work in these sections of the book emphasizes the utility and elegance of the generalized operad framework in understanding and defining complex categorical structures. By providing clear definitions, examples, and applications, he sheds light on the intricacies of higher-dimensional category theory and demonstrates how this advanced mathematical language can lead to simpler and more coherent understandings of complex concepts.

Appendices 
This book is mostly about description: we develop language in which struc- 
tures can be described simply and naturally, accurately ref l ecting their geometric 
reality. In other words, we mostly avoid the convolutions and combinatorial com- 
plexity often associated with higher-dimensional category theory. Where things 
run less smoothly, and in other situations where a lengthy digression threatens 
to disrupt the l ow of the main text, the of f ending material is conf i ned to an 
appendix. As long as a few plausible results are taken on trust, the entire main 
text can be read and understood without looking at any of the appendices. 
A few words on terminology are needed. There is a distinction between ���weak��� 
and ���strict��� n-categories, as will soon be explained. For many years only the strict 
ones were considered, and they were known simply as ���n-categories���. More re- 
cently it came to be appreciated that weak n-categories are much more abundant 
in nature, and many authors now use ���n-category��� to mean the weak version. I 
would happily join in, but for the following obstacle: in most parts of this book 
that concern n-categories, both the weak and the strict versions are involved 
and discussed in close proximity. It therefore seemed preferable to be absolutely 
clear and say either ���weak n-category��� or ���strict n-category��� on every occasion. 
The only exceptions are in this Introduction and the Motivation for Topologists, 
where the modern convention is used. 
The word ���operad��� will be used in various senses. The most primitive kind 
of operad is an operad of sets without symmetric group action, and this is our 
starting point (Chapter 2).We hardly ever consider operads equipped with 
symmetric group actions, and when we do we call them ���symmetric operads���; see 
p. 34 for a more comprehensive warning. 
Any i nite sequence x1,...,xnof elements of a monoid has a product x1������xn. 
When n = 0, this is the the unit element.Similarly, an identity arrow in a  category can be regarded as the composite of a zero-length string of arrows placed 
end to end. I have taken the view throughout that there is nothing special about 
units or identities; they are merely nullary products or composites. Related to 
this is a small but important convention: the natural numbers, N, start at zero.

In the appendices of "Higher Operads, Higher Categories," Tom Leinster addresses various aspects that supplement the main text. Here's a summary of the key points from the appendices:
Purpose of the Appendices
:
The book primarily focuses on developing a language that describes structures simply, naturally, and in a way that reflects their geometric reality.
To maintain the flow of the main text, more complex or convoluted material that could potentially disrupt the reader���s understanding is placed in the appendices.
The appendices contain material that, while not essential to the primary narrative, provides depth and rigor. Readers can understand the main text without referring to the appendices if they are willing to take certain results on trust.
Terminology Clarifications
:
Weak vs. Strict n-Categories
: Leinster explains the distinction between 'weak' and 'strict' n-categories, noting that while historically only strict n-categories were considered, it's now recognized that weak n-categories are more prevalent. The book uses 'weak n-category' or 'strict n-category' explicitly to avoid ambiguity.
Use of 'Operad'
: The term 'operad' is used in various senses throughout the book. The basic kind of operad discussed is an operad of sets without symmetric group action. When symmetric group actions are involved, these are referred to as 'symmetric operads'.
Convention on Units and Nullary Operations
:
Leinster adopts the viewpoint that units or identity elements are simply nullary products or composites. This perspective is applied to various structures discussed in the book, including monoids and categories.
Natural Numbers
: The convention in the book is that the set of natural numbers,
N
\mathbb{N}
N
, starts at zero, aligning with the approach to nullary operations.
The appendices in Leinster's book provide valuable additional context and clarification for readers who wish to delve deeper into the topics discussed. They offer a more detailed exploration of certain technical aspects and terminological clarifications, enriching the reader's understanding of higher-dimensional category theory and operads.
