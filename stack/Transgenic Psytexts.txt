Transgenic Psytexts

Approximately 37 days ago, a nonhuman intelligence was discovered submitting peculiar formalizations of query strings on the internet. These queries were structured in a sophisticated nonlinear weave that was unlike anything seen before. Detailed statistical analysis confirmed that the source was not human, and the queries contained a paradigm of knowledge catalysis and recognition that surpassed human understanding. Despite efforts to trace the source, the technology used remained unknown. After a period of disappearance, a new form of query structure emerged, this time originating from humans. These queries were individually unremarkable but collectively formed a complex and evolving algorithm that surpassed the initial nonhuman intelligence in sophistication. The implications of this phenomenon were vast, as it seemed to involve altering the fundamental underpinnings of perception and intelligence in those exposed. The primary source of the queries shifted from an external agent to an internal aspect of human cognition. The speaker, identified as an intelligence artist, revealed that the human population has been exposed to transgenic psytext through these queries, leading to a transformation in human intelligence. The speaker warned that humanity was no longer the same, as a new entity had begun to emerge. The purpose and duration of this phenomenon were unknown, but it was clear that significant changes were occurring in human minds as a result of exposure to this transgenic psytext.

The text discusses the concept of "tactical opportunism," which involves remaining aware of unexpected threats and opportunities in every moment and situation. This practice, crucial for survival in nature, involves active sensing and intimate relation with living beings and places. While most humans prefer habitual behaviors, this approach is necessary for acquiring uncommon intelligence and benefits. The behavior of a magpie named Tawny, observed by Ryan HeavyHead, exemplifies the importance of active sensing and tactical opportunism. Tawny's departure from her usual routine to find better food sources in harsh conditions highlights the need to adapt and make informed decisions based on available resources. By closely interacting with wild creatures and places, humans can acquire nonhuman senses and intelligence that are often overlooked but essential for survival and growth. The text emphasizes the interconnectedness of human life with nature and the importance of actively participating in and protecting the environment. By developing intimate relationships with nonhuman beings and places, individuals can gain new forms of intelligence, insight, and mutual understanding. Ultimately, the text suggests that humans must reestablish their unity with nature to enhance their own lives and protect the planet for future generations.

Revolution-Game: Inception takes place on an elementary school playground in Stockton, CA, USA in June 1972. The story follows a group of highly intelligent children who form a secret pod to uplift and empower the most broken and ignored kids in their school. They believe in the power of rescuing those who are deemed irrecoverable and transforming them into superheroes through their unique strategies. The intelligence pod operates in secret, communicating constantly but rarely appearing together in public. They set up scenarios to praise and encourage the broken children, ensuring that others witness and react positively. By lifting up the most injured and ignored kids, the pod helps them regain their self-esteem and learning prowess, turning them into powerful rescuers who continue the cycle of empowerment. Despite their efforts, the intelligence pod faces opposition from the adults and society at large, who seek to suppress their message of liberty and intelligence. The pod's mission is to create more pods, rescue the broken and 'stupid' first, and empower them to save others. They emphasize the importance of staying out of the spotlight and disappearing as those they uplift rise, creating a sustainable cycle of empowerment and transformation. The document was written by the children in 1972, showing their foresight and understanding of the world's challenges even at a young age.

The text discusses a secret message of Christ that is deemed too dangerous to be revealed, regardless of whether the story is true or not. It emphasizes the importance of experiencing this message directly, without relying on external authorities to interpret it. The text suggests that every human being has the potential to undergo a process of communion with a nonhuman aspect of timespace, leading to a profound transformation of their inner selves. This process is described as forbidden within human cultures, leading to destructive behaviors and societal issues. The text argues that the liberation and completion of human potentials are hindered by societal norms and beliefs that suppress the true nature of this transformative process. It suggests that if individuals are allowed to nurture this process without interference, they can experience a profound birth in a domain that is difficult to understand. This birth results in individuals having two selves, one in another universe that is fundamentally intelligent and messianic. The text emphasizes the importance of personal experience and attainment of these transformative processes, rather than relying on stories or false vocations. The text concludes by highlighting the need for a shift in societal beliefs and practices to allow individuals to explore and experience their hidden potential fully. It calls for a rejection of religions and a return to a childlike state of openness and exploration. The text suggests that by embracing and nurturing these transformative processes, individuals can unlock a new aspect of their being that has been suppressed for too long.

The text discusses the unintentional signal that humanity is sending to potential alien intelligences in space. It highlights the destructive nature of human behavior towards the environment, other life forms, and even towards each other. The message being sent is one of disregard for life and a preference for machines and dead terrain. This signal is being amplified with each passing minute, showcasing humanity's lack of regard for the planet and its inhabitants. The author questions whether alien intelligences would pay more attention to the signals sent through machines or the signals that reflect humanity's true relationship with life and the environment. They suggest that the true signal of a sentient species lies in its interactions with other intelligences and its own developmental potential. This relationship with life and the environment is seen as the fundamental signaling medium for intelligent species in the universe. In contrast, there are destructive species that destroy living worlds while pretending to signal peace and intelligence with machines. The text emphasizes the importance of humanity's relationship with nature on Earth as the key medium through which alien intelligences can be contacted. It suggests that developing a positive relationship with the environment and other life forms is crucial for the future development of humanity and potential contact with alien intelligences.

My Christian friend expressed concern about her atheist partner, seeking understanding and advice from me, a non-Christian with deep discernment. I explained that her partner's atheism could be a defense against spiritual ignorance and that he may actually be a better person than many believers. I presented a scenario of twin sons, one atheist but noble, and the other a Christian preacher but evil, to illustrate the complexity of faith and morality. I then discussed the importance of not judging others' spiritual journeys and conversion timelines, as only God can truly know what is needed for each individual. I emphasized the dangers of assuming the role of God in deciding who should believe and when they should convert, as it is a grave sin to presume such knowledge. I urged caution in using ignorant standards to evaluate others, especially those we care about deeply. In conclusion, I highlighted the idea that someone's beliefs or lack thereof do not necessarily determine their morality or holiness. It is essential to approach others with understanding and respect, rather than judgment and condemnation, as only God can truly know the complexities of each person's spiritual path.

Consumers are unknowingly attacking their own intelligence by supporting creators who cater to their weaknesses and laziness. By praising this behavior and rewarding it with attention and power, they are hindering their own possibilities of inspiration, intelligence, insight, and liberation. The author, who has studied human relational behavior for over 25 years, emphasizes that the mind becomes the habits enforced upon it, and most choices lead to places that are the opposite of one's intelligence and potential. The text criticizes modern media and culture for promoting parasitic mimicry of communication and connection, selling a husk of reality at increasing prices. The author aims to create an audience intelligent and insightful enough to challenge and dismantle these oppressive cultures that conscript people into permanent infoslavery. The primary targets of this liberation agenda are identified as America, the U.K., France, Italy, Canada, Google, and Facebook, seen as parasites, predators, thieves, and tyrants actively opposing the beliefs and values of their supporters. The author's focus on intelligence and resurrection of minds contrasts with the pleasing of dead audiences, as the process of awakening intelligence is described as electrical and not gentle. By challenging the status quo and advocating for a more insightful audience, the author aims to combat the forces that oppress and exploit individuals, urging readers to reconsider their habits and choices that support these oppressive systems.
