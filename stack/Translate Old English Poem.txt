Could you translate this again for me?'Oft in the stille of the day,
He gan to wandre forth to stray,
And caste his eyen on the stone
That was y-set in the hille's cone,

And knewe the wonder that ther bide,
Thanne sagh he there, as in a tide,
A wonder geste, as him leste
Of alle the folk that he sagh there

He sagh noght oon that did him care
But al was lost that he hadde y-knowe
And he was to himself unknowe.
"Often in the quiet of the day,
He began to wander forth to stray,
And cast his eyes on the stone
That was set in the hill's cone,
And knew the wonder that dwelled there,
Then he saw there, as if in a tide,
A wonderful story, as it pleased him
Of all the people he saw there
He saw no one that concerned him
But all was lost that he had known
And he was to himself unknown."
