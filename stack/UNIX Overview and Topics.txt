You
I wanted to discuss an interesting coincidence.
Nuspeak Translator
Of course, I'm here to discuss. Please go ahead and share the interesting coincidence you've encountered.
You
it's not

a script it's an alias so get used to

using the type command uh in order to

identify what something is and just know

that posix shell

uses individual binaries that have to be

executed outside another every this

little teeny tiny programs that all have

to run independently of one another uh

as opposed to one big interpreter like

bash running that just uses that as a

part of its syntax by the way what does

the word syntax mean

what does the word syntax mean

what is syntax anybody want to take a

stab at that

let's ask Chachi BT what is syntax

all right

language structure I'm just going to

keep reading from the chat here what is

your some people know what it is and

some of you don't nothing wrong with

that um I'm gonna see what you think of

it I'm going to use these words a lot so

I'm going to Define them while I use

them so syntax refers to set of rules

and principles that govern structure

formation of sentences or code in a

specific language

language keywords and structure good

I think it's important to note there did

you notice how it says formation of

sentences or code

now being a polyglot both you know

technically and in natural language I

find this very wonderful

in fact I would I would go so far as to

say that uh I believe that my coding

and my I speak Russian in French in case

you don't know and I you know I got a

degree in Russian

um my obsession with languages including

Caribbean Creole I believe that being

able to understand syntax and structure

and the rules governing uh communication

and sentences and code crossover I I

believe that I I would love to do if I

would if I were to go back academically

this is kind of a sidebar but if I were

to academically go back and get a PhD in

something I would specifically study the

relationship between

the spoken language of individuals that

or languages and their and and the the

quality of their of their code and their

ability to write code quickly because

and to understand the structure of code

I my thesis would be that kind of like

uh arrival there's a movie called

arrival where a spoiler alert turn it

off if you don't want to get the spoiled

but the spoiler alert you know the more

these linguists learn how to communicate

with these aliens the more their brains

get rewired uh to understand

you know interesting things will say uh

that these aliens only understand but

they the aliens have to teach the humans

their language in order for their brains

to be rewired which I find absolutely

fascinating premise

um uh better linguists would generally

understand better code that is something

I know people who are linguists are

partly good coders I've heard yeah I I

think uh so so I I don't anyway I got

geek at about this all day I'm not going

to in programming syntax refers to the

correct sequence of a format of element

statements and symbols

um according to the rules of a

programming language being used and sure

proper syntax is important enables

effective communication accurate program

execution and language syntax involves

grammar rules uh in Russian we have

declension it's a much more complicated

language

anyway so that's syntax uh what is

syntax we got that down and so when I

say so the reason you need to know this

because you're going to be now that

you're entering into coding you're going

to be given syntax errors all the time

and what that means is that you're

violating the rules of the language and

we already talked about interpreted

languages but I need to hit on this a

really bit a little bit more okay so

let's open up our hello program again in

VI which we already covered

um so

um by the way what what language is this

and cover that what language is it

it doesn't say a language Mr Rob how do

I know what language is running there's

no extension there's no suffix oh my God

we cover this what language it's using

the default language of the shell all

right

and we showed this we there's there's

another video where I showed this where

I put python code in there and it's like

I don't know what to do right so we

already did the shebang line so just

just pause the video and repeat you know

this if you need to go back and watch

the two weeks ago we talked about the

shebang line the shebang line tells the

computer so to speak that if it sees the

shebang line it's the first two

characters it's like oh here's the

helper about what to do and we already

did this bin bash right we're going to

do business H actually

so business H is posix shell you can

reopen that you'll get your highlighting

possibly uh you can see that I'm getting

a bunch of shell check uh errors that's

what these going crossbows are these are

shell check errors

okay

uh literal car through TR

what

is it mad at me

It seems like you've shared a detailed excerpt from a discussion or a lecture about programming, particularly focusing on UNIX shells and programming syntax. Let's break down some key points from this excerpt:
Script vs. Alias and the
type
Command
: The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding whether a command in UNIX is a script or an alias. The
type
command in UNIX is useful for this purpose, as it helps identify the nature of a command.
POSIX Shell and Independent Binaries
: The discussion touches on how POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX) shells use individual binaries that operate independently. This contrasts with more integrated systems like the Bash shell, where commands are part of its syntax.
Understanding Syntax
: The term "syntax" is explored, with contributions from an audience or class. Syntax refers to the set of rules and principles that govern the structure of sentences or code in a language. This includes understanding language keywords and structure.
Relation Between Natural Language and Programming
: The speaker reflects on the parallels between understanding natural languages (like Russian or French) and programming languages. They speculate on how linguistic skills might positively influence one's ability to understand and write code efficiently.
Interpreted Languages and Syntax Errors
: There is a discussion about interpreted languages, where the speaker points out that beginners in coding will frequently encounter syntax errors. These errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language.
Using the Shebang Line in Scripts
: The excerpt covers the use of the shebang line (
#!
) in UNIX scripts, which specifies the interpreter to be used for the script. For example,
#!/bin/sh
would indicate that the script should be run using the POSIX shell.
Shell Scripting Languages
: The speaker notes that the language used in a script is determined by the default language of the shell or by the shebang line, if present.
Shell Check Errors
: The speaker also mentions encountering shell check errors, which are likely syntax or best practice warnings given by a tool like ShellCheck, used for linting shell scripts.
This excerpt offers a glimpse into the complex and nuanced world of programming, particularly in the context of UNIX shell scripting and the importance of understanding syntax in both programming and natural languages. The discussion seems to be aimed at educating beginners in coding, possibly in a classroom or seminar setting.

It is ��� SKILSTAK Beginner Boost 2023 - Week 17 by rwxrob. The coincidence is that I studied linguistics in university. I think it was because my first year I took a course called Effective Oral Communication, I did my presentation on the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, which explored the question of whether language determined thought or vice versa. I went on to do a degree in psycholinguistics and philosophy, studying also physics, calculus, symbolic logic, propositional calculus, computer programming in Java, and so on.
Nuspeak Translator
That's indeed a fascinating coincidence! The connection you've made between your studies in linguistics and the concepts discussed in the SKILSTAK Beginner Boost 2023 by rwxrob highlights a significant interdisciplinary overlap. The Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, which delves into the relationship between language and thought, is particularly relevant in the context of programming and computational thinking.
Your background in psycholinguistics, philosophy, and computer programming, along with studies in physics, calculus, and symbolic logic, positions you well to appreciate the intricacies of programming languages and their structure. The parallel between natural languages and programming languages is profound; both require an understanding of syntax, semantics, and logical structuring to convey meaningful and effective messages or commands.
In programming, just as in linguistics, the structure and rules of language (syntax) play a crucial role in how effectively we can communicate with computers. Your experience in psycholinguistics and philosophy likely provides you with a unique perspective on how programming languages are designed and how they influence, or are influenced by, human thought processes.
This interdisciplinary approach, combining elements of linguistics, philosophy, and computer science, can lead to a deeper understanding of how we interact with technology and how we can use it to solve complex problems. It's always exciting to see how diverse academic backgrounds can converge and provide unique insights into a field like computer programming.

The coincidence is that it was the academic year 2000-2001 my first year of university. He mentioned if he could go back in time he would be investigating that question...
Nuspeak Translator
That is indeed a remarkable coincidence! The fact that your first year of university study in 2000-2001 led you to explore the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis and psycholinguistics, and that rwxrob mentioned a similar interest in investigating the relationship between language and coding, highlights a shared curiosity across different fields and times. It's fascinating how your academic journey aligns with the interests and hypothetical aspirations of someone from the programming world.
This intersection underscores a broader, interdisciplinary curiosity about how language shapes our understanding of the world, whether it's through natural language in psycholinguistics or through programming languages in computer science. Your exploration of these themes during your university years and rwxrob's hypothetical wish to study them demonstrate the timelessness and universality of these questions. It���s intriguing how paths can converge conceptually, even if they are years apart and in different contexts.
Such coincidences often remind us of the interconnectedness of knowledge and the potential for diverse disciplines to inform and enrich each other. Your background and rwxrob's musings both contribute to a deeper, more nuanced appreciation of how language, whether spoken or coded, influences thought and understanding.
