Accuracy	Broad sense: how "close to the mark" an Estimator is. 	Narrow sense: the expected or realized extent of Surprise on an estimation, usually about Sense State reflecting theRecognition density 	A lower-resolution camera or fMRI has lower Accuracy and thus lesser capacity to map fine scale features of stimuli. 	The true distribution was 10 +/- 1 and the person guessed 10 +/- 5, thus they had higher Accuracy. I was sure the green car was really blue; this inaccuracy was caused by the dim light.

As a matter of determining the ratio of populations to sample, the following is instructive > https://aeon.co/videos/what-is-it-to-be-bayesian-the-pretty-simple-math-modelling-behind-a-big-data-buzzword
Belief	Broad sense: Felt sense by an Agent of something being true, or confidence it is the case.	Narrow sense: the State of a Random variable in a Bayesian Inference scheme.	The Prior or Empirical prior in Bayesian Inference can be a Belief on Hidden State .	A Belief in Bayesian Inference requires Subjective feeling states or conscious awareness.

Accuracy: Broadly, accuracy refers to how close an estimator is to the true value or target. In a narrower sense, accuracy is the extent of surprise or error in an estimation, often related to the recognition of sensory input. For example, a lower-resolution camera or fMRI has lower accuracy and cannot capture fine-scale features of stimuli effectively. Correct examples include a person guessing a value close to the true distribution (10 +/- 1) with a small range (10 +/- 5), indicating higher accuracy. Incorrect examples include perceiving a green car as blue due to poor lighting, leading to inaccuracy. Accuracy is inversely related to uncertainty.
Ambiguity: Broadly, ambiguity refers to the extent to which stimuli can have multiple plausible interpretations, requiring prior knowledge or actions for disambiguation. In a narrower sense, ambiguity is a specific model parameter used to represent uncertainty, particularly in sensory perception. For instance, noisy readings from a thermometer result in high ambiguity given the sensory input to the agent. Another example is the curiosity about the contents of a box, where there is ambiguity about what it might contain. Ambiguity is related to uncertainty regarding hidden states given sensory input.
Bayesian Inference: Bayesian inference is an approach that uses specified priors or empirical priors to update the distributional posterior, as opposed to frequentist analysis. The key ideas of Bayesian inference existed before Rev. Bayes, and computational research has contributed to its development. An example of Bayesian inference is the frequentist t-test. The provided link gives an instructional example of determining the ratio of populations to sample, showcasing Bayesian inference.
Belief: Broadly, belief refers to the subjective sense of an agent that something is true or the confidence in its validity. In a narrower sense, belief represents the state of a random variable in a Bayesian inference scheme. In Bayesian inference, the prior or empirical prior can be a belief about hidden states. Belief in Bayesian inference requires subjective feeling states or conscious awareness. Belief serves as the most likely hypothesis that provides an explanation for the cause of sensory states, where the cause is a hidden state of the generative process.
Belief updating: Belief updating refers to changes in a Bayesian inference belief over time. It occurs when new sensory data or evidence is incorporated into the model, altering the prior. For example, incoming sensory data can lead to belief updating. However, a promise to never undergo belief updating, even with new information, suggests a lack of flexibility in adjusting beliefs. Belief updating involves altering the prior based on new evidence from the generative process.
Complexity: Complexity refers to the extent to which an agent needs to revise its belief to explain incoming sensory observations. In Bayesian model selection, complexity can be measured using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the prior and posterior distributions. It is used to find the simplest (least complex) model to avoid overfitting on the noise present in sensory observations. Model complexity can also refer to the number of predictor variables or features required for accurate predictions. Complexity is considered the opposite of concavity.
Data: Data refers to a collection of values of qualitative or quantitative variables related to one or more agents or objects. For example, three readings from a thermometer constitute data. An anecdote, on the other hand, does not qualify as data. Evidence is data that is evaluated by an agent in the context of their generative model.
Expectation: Within a Bayesian inference framework, expectation refers to an estimator about future timesteps. It represents the prediction or anticipation of future outcomes based on a model. However, it is distinct from a mere prediction since expectation implies waiting for the prediction to be realized. Expectation is related to anticipation, prediction, and prediction error.
Inference: Inference is the process of reaching a conclusion, either local or global, within a model. In Bayesian inference, it involves using sensory observations and known parameters to determine the state of unknown latent causes. For example, an agent may engage in inference on action planning, action prediction, as well as perceptual inference in a model of active vision. Inference can also apply to policy selection, as observed when a ball rolls downhill, veering left or right based on inferred policy. Inference is related to action and perceptual inference, as well as Bayesian inference.
Information: Information, measured in bits, refers to the reduction of uncertainty in a belief distribution. It can be syntactic (Shannon information theory) or semantic (Bayesian information theory). For example, 1 terabyte contains more maximum information than 1 gigabyte. Information can be modified relative to a reference version, even if the file checksum remains intact.
Learning: Broadly, learning refers to the process of an agent updating its cognition and possibly behavior. In a narrower sense, learning occurs through Bayesian inference when the parameters of a generative model undergo belief updating. For instance, a software agent engaging in belief updating on internal parameters represents learning. However, from a Bayesian inference perspective, learning is only adaptive if the belief updating is adaptive. Learning model parameters is also known as parameter estimation and involves using sensory observations and previously inferred hidden states. In Bayesian inference, parameters are treated as random variables.
Outcome: If the environment is considered a generative process that can be sampled in different states, the statistical result of sampling (data, sensory observation) is known as the outcome. It represents the data produced by sampling from a generative process. For example, one can be concerned about the outcome of a decision. Generative modeling involves using outcomes to approximate a statistical model of the generative process.

Summarize:

Posterior	The Update to the Prior after Observation has occurred 	In Bayes' theorem, the Posterior is equal to the product of the Likelihood and Prior divided by the model evidence.	The Posterior distribution reflects our degrees of Belief about Latent causes after we see Sensory Data. 	The Posterior distribution can always be trivially obtained by solving Bayes' theorem.	Solving an Inverse problem to go from Outcomes given a State determining a State given an Outcome. In representation learning the Posterior is called the Recognition Model since it "recognizes" the Latent cause that underlie the generation of the Sensory outcomes.  
Prediction	An Estimator about a State in a Model at a future time.   	The process of using a learned Generative Model to forecast what value a future Hidden State will be.	After successfully Learning the structure of the Generative Process  the Agent can make a Prediction about the future state of this Generative Process and the associated Sensory Data it will generate.	A magic 8-ball can make a Prediction that will reliably be true.	The top-down priors aim at Prediction the incoming Sensory Data based on what the Agent has learned about the environment. An incorrect Prediction results in a Prediction error which the Agent attempts to minimize in the long run in the process of Prediction error minimization.
Prior	The initial or preceding state of a Belief in Bayesian Inference, before Sensory Data (Observation or Evidence ) occurs. 		Active Vision uses Prior on Sensory input .	We arrested someone with no Priors.	In the Active Inference (Continuous state space formulation), the Prior is represented by a Stochastic State space equation which represents the Agent's belief about how the Hidden State in the environment change over time.
State	is the statistical, computational, or mathematical value for a parameter within the State space of a Model . 		Blanket State is a type of State that partition Internal State from External State 	California is the State with the best honey on the West Coast. 	111. Situation, Condition, State (from here)

The words, situation and condition, imply, something accidental, and transitory; with this difference, that situation, respects outward circumstances; condition, those, within the matter referred to; whereas, that of state,implies, something, more habitual, and lasting.

We, generally, use the word, situation, as relative, to affairs, rank or fortune; condition, with respect, to the nature, quality or property of a thing; and that, of state, applying it to health, or, our well or ill-being.

We say, our situation is bad; when we are surrounded with difficulties: that a building is in bad condition; when out of repair; and, that some persons enjoy but an indifferent state of health.

An ill-state of health, added to a bad situation of affairs, is a condition, into which, every man must, naturally, dread the falling.

Such is the condition, and vicissitude of human life, that, the most prudent men, have, often, found themselves in perplex|ing situations; and from a state of happiness, have, as it were, through the perverseness of fortune, fallen into one most wretched and deplorable.
State space	Set of variables/parameters that describe a System .	A state space is the set of all possible configurations of a system	The State space of a Generative Model can be a Continuous state space or Discrete state space . 	In politics, the State space  refers to the total area governed by a particular state.	
Stationarity	Of a Random variable , that it is described by parameters that are drawn from a  Gaussian distribution and unchanging over the time horizon of analysis. 		A common assumption of many time series algorithms is that the data exhibits Stationarity.	I am exhibiting Stationarity when I stop walking.	A common assumption in many time series techniques is that the data are at Stationarity .

A stationary process has the property that the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure do not change over time. Stationarity can be defined in precise mathematical terms, but for our purpose we mean a flat looking series, without trend, constant variance over time, a constant autocorrelation structure over time and no periodic fluctuations (seasonality).

For practical purposes, stationarity can usually be determined from a run sequence plot.

Surprise	In Bayesian Inference, Surprise is the negative log evidence, directly corresponding to the inverse of probability (high probability, low surprisal; low probability, high surprisal). The proxy that bounds surprisal is the difference between Prior and Posterior Distribution â€” how "surprising" Sensory Data are to the Generative Model of the Agent.	Surprise (also known as Surprisal or self-Information), is a quantity that, according to the Free Energy Principle, must be minimized in order for an Agent to survive; Variational Free Energy provides an upper bound on Surprisal and is minimized instead of minimizing Surprisal directly.	Surprisal cannot be minimized directly because it is involves calculating the Evidence term in Bayes' Rule which generally involves an intractable integral over all possible states an organism can be in.	When they walk into the room, yell "Surprise"! 	An organism that minimizes Surprisal can maintain Non-Equilibrium Steady State and will consistently revisit an Attracting set of states. Minimizing Surprisal is equivalent to maximizing model evidence.

Summarize: Temporal Depth	The length of a time window or horizon considered (longer time â†’ deeper / more Temporal Depth ) 		In deep temporal models, Temporal Depth or occurs because of the number of Counterfactual possibilities one must account for increases as more future states are modeled (see: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00579/full)	The longer the queue, the greater the Temporal Depth.	From Breaking down unitization: Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts?  "Depth" as a measured difference applied to change (time passing) as Memory and Cognition . "Graf and Schacter (1989) first described unitization as the process whereby multiple, separate, items become represented as a single unit, either through perceiving or conceiving of a structure (e.g., semantic meaning) that would connect the disparate units."  Which leaves us with at least two ways of "structuring" time units (episodes and cycles (diachronic)).
Uncertainty	In Bayesian Inference , a measure of the Expectation of Surprise (Entropy) of a Random variable (associated with its variance or inverse Precision )	Random fluctuations around the true value of a quantity we are trying to measure that are a result of uncontrolled variables in the environment or measurement apparatus.	A measure of unpredictability or expected Surprise (cf, Entropy ). The Uncertainty  about a Random variable  is often quantified with its Variance  (inverse Precision ).	I felt a lot of Uncertainty after that job interview.	From Basics of Estimating Measurement Uncertainty https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2556585/There is a table of terminology of the science of measurement (metrology) that includes common metrological terms and their definitions, all of which recognize that making measurement comparisons leads to some degree of measurement uncertainty. 
Action	Broad sense: The dynamics, mechanisms, and measurements of Behavior 	Narrow sense: The sequence of Active States  enacted by an Agent  via Policy selection from Affordance 	Ants are continually involved in Action in real life (Realism) and/or in a Model (Instrumentalism) 	I love this band's first song, can't wait till the Action really begins! 	Action of the Agent is selected by Action Planning . As the consequences of Action are not fully known, the Expected Free Energy  is calculated over Affordance and used for Variational Free Energy Action and Planning as Divergence Minimization 
Action Planning	The selection of an Affordance based upon Inference of Expected Free Energy 		The robot assessed its current and target location, then engaged in Action Planning to decide under time pressure how to navigate.	The Agent used Action Planning algorithms for Variational Free Energy Inference  on Sensory input 	Action Planning draws from set of Affordances and uses Expected Free Energy Inference, also known as Action Prediction .
Agency	The ability of an Agent to engage in Action in their Niche and enact Goal-driven selection or Policy selection  based upon Preference 		An Agent uses their Agency to sculpt their environment which makes it more predictable thereby minimizing the agent'sVariational Free Energy and maintaining its Markov Blanket in the face of random fluctuations.	I got a new picture taken at the passport Agency.	Agent has Agency
Behavior	The sequence of Action that an Agent is observed to enact.		I expect you to be on your best Behavior!

The Active Inference Agent uses its selected Policy to take Action that we call its Behavior.	The Behavior of this hammer is being determined entirely by my Internal States without being intermediated by Blanket States. 	
Policy	Sequence of Actions, reflected by series of Active States as implemented in Policy selection which is Action Prediction or Action and Planning as Divergence Minimization 		The sequence of Actions that an Agent plans to take is a Policy. 	What insurance Policy do you recommend for my house?	Policy selection in Active Inference is about Prediction error minimization or minimization of Expected Free Energy 
Policy selection	The process of an Agent engaging in Action Planning from set of Affordance, in Active Inference based upon minimization of Expected Free Energy 		When the Agent decided to go one way instead of the other, it was due to an internal process of Policy selection, specifically Action and Planning as Divergence Minimization. 	We went shopping for insurance and the package was already determined for me, this is a case of Stochastic Policy selection.	Similar to Decision-making 
Preference	parameter in Bayesian Inference Markov Decision Process that ranks or scores the extent to how an Agent values Sensory input .  		The Generative Model of the bacteria underwent parameter fitting (Belief updating / Learning ) on Action , guided by a Preference for medium but not high/low sugar concentration. 	All Action results in Agents that realize their Preference in terms of Sensory outcome . 	In the Discrete state space formulation of Active Inference, the Preferences or habits of an Agent can be encapsulated in a Prior Preference Distribution, a target distribution of States the agent wishes to end up due to its phenotype and other habits it has picked up throughout its existence.
Active Inference	Active Inference is a Process Theory related to Free Energy Principle .		It is fun and rewarding to learn and apply Active Inference as a framework for Perception, Cognition , and Action â€” it is a Process Theory compatible with the Free Energy Principle.	Active Inference is a style of reinforcement learning Artificial intelligence that uses frequentist statistics only. 	The conclusion of Active Inference is a Hypothesis (conjecture) about the feasibility of adopting certain Policy (strategy profiles) that the Agent makes a Generative Model with Temporal Depth.
Epistemic value	is the value of Information gain or Expectation of reduction in Uncertainty about a State  with respect to a Policy, used in Policy selection 		When the environment contains Uncertainty I would like to undertake the action of Foraging for the sake of it to see if I can gather more relevant Observations to explain what is going on around me. Such relevant Observations have Epistemic value for me as an Agent. 	In the case of temperature homeostasis, taking Actions that move the body temperature in an adaptive direction are of purely Epistemic value.	It is variously known as Bayesian surprise, epistemic affordance, the value of information, intrinsic motivation and so on.
Expected Free Energy	Measure for performing Inference on Action over a given time horizon (Policy selection , Action and Planning as Divergence Minimization ). 	The two components of Expected Free Energy are the imperative to  satisfy Preferences, and the penalty for failing to minimize Expectation  of Surprisal.	The deep affective Inference Agent used Expected Free Energy calculation as a basis of Policy selection .	The amount of calories that the Living system has at Non-Equilibrium Steady State is the Expected Free Energy . 	Expected Free Energy can be seen as.... 
Free Energy	Free Energy is an Information Theoretic quantity that constitutes an upper bound on Surprisal . 	Free Energy can refer to various or multiple sub-types of Free Energy: 

* Variational Free Energy 
* Expected Free Energy 
* Free Energy of the Expected Future 
* Helmholtz Free Energy 
* ....	Free Energy can refer to various different formulations and decompositions, that share some important key features.	You can get the electricity for no cost at all, it is Free Energy.	
Free Energy Principle	A generalization of Predictive Coding (PC) according to which organisms minimize an upper bound on the Entropy of Sensory input  (or sensory signals) (the Free Energy). Under specific assumptions, Free Energy translates toPrediction error . 	A set of statistical principles that describe how Agents can maintain their self-organization  in the face of random fluctuations from the environment.	As a principle, the Free Energy Principle cannot be falsified. 	There is not enough empirical evidence to support the Free Energy Principle.	An Agent that is consistent with the Free Energy Principle will be able to minimize Variational Free Energy by taking Actions or using Perception in a way that maximizes the Evidence for its Generative Model of the environment. 

The Free Energy Principle is a more general statement about specific kinds of self-organization in random Non-linear dynamical systems assuming that these systems have certain properties like Ergodicity (weakly mixing) and a Markov Blanket. According to the Free Energy Principle, systems that minimize Variational Free Energy will maintain their low (thermodynamic) Entropy structure through Autopoiesis in the face of random fluctuations in the environment. To do so, they must take Actions that maintain the integrity of their Markov Blanket and develop a Generative Model that can successfully predict future states of the environment based on the Sensory Data they receive through the Markov Blanket.

Parr and Friston 2019 wrote "Crucially, this means the Generalized Free Energy  reduces to the Variational Free Energy  for outcomes that had been observed in the past.....Outcomes in the Generalized Free Energy formulation are represented explicitly as Beliefs.

Friston Blanket	Markov Blanket with partitioned Active States and Sense State .

Summarize: Generative Model	A formalism that describes the mapping between Hidden State, and Expectations of Action Prediction , Sensory outcome . 	Recognition Model Update Internal State parameter  that correspond to External State  (including Hidden State causes of environment  states), Blanket State , and Internal State  (meta-modeling). In contrast, Generative Model  take those same Internal State  parameter  Estimator  and emit expected or plausible observations.	Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes are commonly used for computational modeling of Generative Models.  	The subject of the photography session made art as well, they are a Generative Model â€” but if they wouldn't have made the art, they would have only been a Model, not a Generative Model . 	
Generative Process	Underlying @dynamical process in the Niche giving rise to Agent Observation and @agent Action Prediction  	Enactive ecological process using morphological computing processes where the Niche Regime of Attention @morphogenesis and generative model interact to create an embodied learning dyanamic.	The Generative Process generates Sensory Data.	The Agent  uses its Generative Process to determine future Hidden State of the environment.	The Generative Process exists in certain States that are Hidden State from the perspective of the Agent. When in a state, from the statistical perspective, it can generate a Sensory outcome which is sensed by the Agent. The agent will use this Sensory Data to form a Generative Model which may or may not match the true Generative Process but will nonetheless allow it to predict future outcomes drawn from the Generative Process if it has a good Generative Model.
Niche	Ecology System constituting the Generative Process (as Partitioned from the Agent who instantiates a Generative Model ). 		Every ant lives in their ecological Niche.	That band's kind of music honestly is just too Niche for me. 	
Non-Equilibrium Steady State	Technically, a Non-Equilibrium Steady State requires a solution to the Fokker Planck equation (i.e., density dynamics). A nonequilibrium steady-state solution entails solenoidal (i.e., conservative or divergence free) dynamics that break detailed balance (and underwrite stochastic chaos ). In other words, The dynamics of systems at Non-Equilibrium Steady State  are not time reversible (unlike equilibrium steady states, in which the flow is entirely dissipative).	Generally, a Non-Equilibrium Steady State refers to a System with dynamics that are unchanging, or at Stationarity in some State. 	Blood sugar levels are dynamic and fluctuating, however they revisit characteristic states repeatedly, this can be described by a Non-Equilibrium Steady State.	The ball just lay still on the floor, we can describe this as exhibiting a Non-Equilibrium Steady State .	Similar to Stationarity 
Particle	An Agent consisting of Blanket State and Internal State , partitioned off from Niche .		Internal State and Blanket States together constitute the Particle. 	The house was made of Particle board. 	
Recognition Model	Recognition Model is the kind of Model that affords Variational Inference, which lets us calculate or approximate a probability distribution. Recognition Model is a synonym for Variational Model.	In Dayan and Abbot (2001), the probability of a Hidden State (causes) given Sensory Data (effects) under some parameter. 	After constructing a Generative Model, an Agent can invert this model to obtain the Recognition Model which allows for the prediction of the Hidden State (causes) that generated some new Sensory Data.	That billboard has a picture of one of the most Recognition Model in the world. 	
Representation	A structural correspondence between some Random variable  inside a System and some Random variable  outside the System  (isomorphism being the strongest kind of correspondence), such that the Systemengages in Inference carried out by the System maintains the correspondence		The sterotypical neural pattern induced by a Stimulus is considered a Representation, at least by those who subscribe to Representationalism. 	No Taxation without Representation!	
Attention	Broad sense: Generative Model that is aware of some Stimulus, reflected by its Salience 	Narrow sense: Attention modulates the  the confidence on the Precision of Sense State, reflecting Sensory input 	The Model instantly updated to the new Sensory Data because it was paying maximal Attention to the Stimulus.	The words were impactful even though the child was not paying Attention at all. 	Attention is structured in complex sociocultural Systems to realize a Regime of Attention 
Evidence	Data as recognized and interpreted by Generative Model of Agent 		Every photon is like a piece of Evidence on the retina. 	Just because you have litigated the case with Data doesn't mean that you provided any Evidence 	
Observation	The Belief updating of an Internal State registered by a Sensory input, given the weighting assigned to that class of input in comparison with weighting of the competing Priors. (This is a narrow sense of "observation," where the Agent is "looking for this kind of input." This sense excludes situations where (a) an incoming stimulus with these attributes has already been explained-away or pre-discounted, or (b) the prior is so strongly weighted as to exclude updating in response to any inputs (other than, perhaps, "catastrophic" ones, as may occur in e.g. fainting, hysterical blindness).)	Any Sensory input, either discrete-valued or continuous-valued. (This is a broad sense.)	One Observation can make all the difference. 	Observations are not required in order to do empirical parametrization of a statistical model. 	
Perception	Posterior State Inference after each new Observation.		Visual Perception gives us many demonstrations of the characteristics of our Generative Model â€” for example saccades, the blind spot, and blink supression.	Active Inference models Action and Perception as literally the same thing for each Agent. 	
Salience	The extent to which a Cue commands the Attention of an Agent given their Regime of Attention 		Salience is related to how relevant a given Stimulus appears to be. 	I can smell dinner cooking, and already my mouth is Salience.	Related to Attention, for example of Affordance 
Hierarchical Model	A hierarchy of Estimators, which operate at different spatiotemporal timescales (so they track features at different scales); all carrying out Predictive Processing 		A Nested Model is a Hierarchical Model, for example the Hierarchically Mechanistic Mind.	The Hierarchical Model stated that water boils at a higher temperature at higher altitudes.	
Living system	Agent engaged in Autopoiesis 		A body is a Living system.	A Living system  is a mathematical model used to predict weather patterns.	
Multi-scale system	Realism framing of Hierarchical Model 		The Generative Model of counties within states within countries, was a Multi-scale system 	In culinary arts, a Multi-scale system is a method for measuring ingredients in both metric and imperial units.	
System	Set of relations described by State space of a Model . 	Differentiable and Integratable in terms of Variables and functions.	George Mobus argues that Systems have some fundamental properties such as structure and function.  	A System is the scientific term for a large group of wolves.

High road	One of two roads (arguments) that lead to the Free Energy Principle as a possible conclusion which starts with philosophical questions about what properties a thing must have to "exist" (i.e. it must be measurable) and then uses principles of Autopoiesis and non-equilibrium Thermodynamic systems from a statistical perspective to show what kinds of systems could continue to maintain themselves over time (see Friston 2019: Beyond the Desert Landscape and the other road, the Low road ).

"The high road stands in for a top-down approach that starts by asking fundamental questions about the necessary properties things must possess if they exist. Using mathematical (variational) principles, once can then show that existence is an embodied exchange of a creatures with its environment - that necessarily entails predictive processing as one aspect of self-evidencing mechanics."		The High road to the Free Energy Principle starts by talking about random Non-linear dynamical systems in general without a specific focus on biological organisms with brains.	You take the High road and I'll take the low road.	The High road connects a number of different fields together, drawing from concepts of Autopoiesis and self-organization within random Non-linear dynamical systems who are proposed to be in Non-Equilibrium Steady State with respect to the environment. Under certain Ergodicity assumptions about such systems it is possible to show how the Free Energy Principle arises.

Low road 	One of two roads (arguments) that lead to the Free Energy Principle as a possible conclusion which starts with fundamental questions from neuroscience and psychology about the nature of perception in biological organisms within a changing environment (see Friston 2019: Beyond the Desert Landscape and the other road, the High road ).

"The low road is to pursue the agenda established by Kant and Helmholtz to generalize - in a bottom up way - the capacity for inference and prediction to see how far it takes us in understand embodied exchange with the environment."		The Low road  to the Free Energy Principle starts by looking at how biological organisms perceive their environment and take actions within it to develop a notion about how they can successfully predict the next state they will be in (Perception as Hypothesis testing). 	Be careful, the Low road  can be dangerous.

I apologize for the oversight. Here's the revised entry:
Tree: In the context of active inference, a tree refers to a hierarchical structure that represents the generative model of an agent's environment. It captures the causal dependencies between variables and their conditional relationships, allowing for efficient inference and prediction. The tree structure helps organize and represent the complexity of the agent's world, enabling effective decision-making and action planning.

Hierarchical Structure: In the context of active inference, a hierarchical structure refers to an organizational framework that captures the nested relationships and dependencies between variables in an agent's generative model. It represents the hierarchical nature of the agent's environment, where higher-level variables are influenced by lower-level variables. This structure allows for efficient information processing, inference, and decision-making, as it enables the agent to reason and make predictions at different levels of abstraction.

The nodes in a tree are connected by edges, representing the relationships or dependencies between them. Trees are often used as data structures for organizing and representing hierarchical relationships, such as in hierarchical clustering algorithms or decision trees used in machine learning.

Branching Structure: A tree is a type of graph where each element is connected to other elements in a way that forms a hierarchical network without cycles. It consists of interconnected nodes that exhibit a parent-child relationship, with each node having only one parent except for the root node. The nodes are linked by edges, representing the connections or dependencies between them. Trees are commonly used in various fields to represent hierarchical relationships, such as in data structures, decision-making processes, and evolutionary classifications.

I apologize for the repetition in my previous response. Here's an alternative definition:
Hierarchical Graph: A tree is a structure composed of interconnected nodes that establish a hierarchical relationship. Each node, except for the root node, has a single parent and can have multiple children. The connections between nodes, known as edges, signify the hierarchical dependencies and form a network that does not contain any cycles. Trees are widely used in various domains to represent and organize hierarchical information, such as file systems, organizational structures, and family trees.
