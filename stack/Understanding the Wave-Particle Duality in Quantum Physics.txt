Is Light a Wave or a Particle?
It���s in your physics textbook, go look. It says that you can either model light as an electromagnetic wave OR you can model light a stream of photons. You can���t use both models at the same time. It���s one or the other. It says that, go look. Here is a likely summary from most textbooks. [���]

It���s in your physics textbook, go look. It says that you can either model light as an electromagnetic wave OR you can model light a stream of photons. You can���t use both models at the same time. It���s one or the other. It says that, go look.

Here is a likely summary from most textbooks.

1. Light as a wave: Light can be described (modeled) as an electromagnetic wave. In this model, a changing electric field creates a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field then creates a changing electric field and BOOM - you have light. Unlike many other waves (sound, water waves, waves in a football stadium), light does not need a medium to ���wave��� in.

Oh, that is too simple of an explanation? How about this?

Light 1

These are one form of Maxwell���s equations. They describe the relationship between the electric and magnetic field (well mostly the last two). If you like, you can use vector calculus on the above equations and then eliminate B to get:

This is the form of the wave equation. So, Maxwell���s equations do say that light is a wave.

2. Light as a particle: The textbook might start off with some experimental evidence from the historic photoelectric effect to show that the wave model of light doesn���t always describe what happens.

It will then say that we can model light as individual ���things��� (some books actually say particles and others just say photons). These light ���things��� have energy that depends on the wavelength such that:

Here h is Planck���s constant and �� is the wavelength of the light and f the frequency. With the photon model, a brighter light just produces more photons per second.

Is light a particle or a wave?

Most texts end with something like this:

���Is light a particle or a wave? This is a difficult question - the answer is that in some situations light behaves as a particle and in others it behaves as a wave.���

What's wrong with multiple models?
We always have multiple models for things that we see. However, they are different than this wave-particle model of light. Let���s look at a few other models.

Momentum. When you start looking at momentum, it is almost always (except in the awesome textbook Matter and Interactions) defined as:

Momentum 12

This is great. It���s simple and it���s useful. It goes great with the momentum principle that says that the net force on an object is the time rate of change of momentum. Of course, you could also say it is wrong. What if you have a proton moving at 90 percent the speed of light? In that case, you can���t use this definition of momentum with the momentum principle. Instead, you have to use this model:

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

That���s nice, right? Some people call this the ���relativistic momentum���. However, I like to call this just plain momentum. But what does this have to do with two models for light? Well, what if I wanted to find the momentum of a proton going at just 10% the speed of light? Which model would I use? The answer depends on how quickly you want to calculate this and how accurate you want your answer to be. Yes, I know ���quick��� is relative.

Here is a plot of momentum of a proton as a function of speed for the two models.

Momentumplot

You can see that at lower speeds, the two models agree. The faster the proton goes, the less the two models agree.

Gravity. Everyone knows the model for the gravitational force, right? You can write it like this:

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

No. That is wrong. That model only works when close to the surface of the Earth. The gravitational force is:

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

That is still wrong, but better. However, we don���t often use the better model for the gravitational force near the surface of the Earth. Why? Because the mg model works well enough. Also, the two models agree on the surface of the Earth just like the two expressions for the proton momentum agree for ���slow��� speeds.

Quantum Mechanics. I am going to skip many of the very interesting details, but let me just say that I can use the following model the behavior of a super tiny particle in a box. Here is an older post with most of the particle in a box details. Knock yourself out with that.

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

Or maybe you would like to write it out like this:

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

This is Schrodinger���s equation and �� is called the wave function. It doesn���t give you anything you could directly measure, but from it you could get the probability density - or a description of where a particle is likely to be found (or really, anything else you can know about the particle).

But wait! There���s more. What if you use Schrodinger���s equation to look at a particle in a one dimensional box? Why would you do this? Because it is mathematically simple and because we can use it to explore some of the results of a quantum system. From Schrodinger���s equation, you would find that the particle can only exist at certain discrete energies. This is really one of the key points of quantum mechanics (it���s the quant in quantum).

My favorite quantum analogy is a staircase. For a staircase you can be on one step or the next step but you really can���t be in between steps. In this case, you could say that height is quantized. The same is true for a particle in a box or an electron in a hydrogen atom. There are only certain possible energy levels.

ADVERTISEMENT

Does this quantum energy model agree with classical mechanics? Yes. If you looked at a tennis ball bouncing back and forth in a typical classroom, you could calculate the quantized energy levels. However, these energy levels are so close to each other that you essentially would never be able to experimentally verify that the ball can only have certain energy levels.

Just to be clear: the quantum model of stuff is just like the other models above. It slowly gives a different result from the classical model of stuff.

Why Do Textbooks Include the Photon Model of Light?
You have been very patient. I know you want to talk about photons, but I had to get the model stuff out of the way. But like I said, just about every introductory physics textbook talks about photons using the photoelectric effect as a basis for this model.

There is a reason for this. Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1921 in part for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Of course, Einstein did some other awesome stuff. In particular, the general and special theory of relativity. But the Nobel Prize didn���t mention this - just the photoelectric effect. However, during Einstein���s acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, he talked about relativity and not the photoelectric effect.

But here is the crazy part (I know, you probably think this whole post is crazy): the photoelectric effect can be explained with a classical wave model of light along with a quantum model of matter. Really, it can. Skipping the details, let me just say (and you can look in your quantum mechanics book to verify this) that if you have a particle with energy E1 and you want it to transition to the energy level E2 you can do that by adding a time-varying potential such that:

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

Hey! That looks strangely similar to the equation for the energy of a photon. Yup. If you like, you can use light with a frequency of f to induce the transition from one energy level to another. Even better, it doesn���t matter if this transition is from a higher to lower or lower to higher energy level. This oscillating perturbation can explain both absorption AND emission of light.

What about the photoelectric effect? Well, all the results you see experimentally can be explained if the electrons in the metal can only exist at certain energy levels (quantum model of matter) and the light is a wave. Actually, some of the older quantum mechanics textbooks show this as an example problem.

ADVERTISEMENT

But then why is the photon model in textbooks? I would say it is because of educational inertia. Who writes the textbooks? If you answer ���people���, then you are correct. But where do these ���people��� learn physics? If you said ���textbooks���, that would be a fairly nice answer. So, people learn from textbooks that have photons. Next they write a textbook, so clearly they will have photons in their books. Simple.

Light is Quantized
My main point here is that the photon isn���t what you think it is. It isn���t a tiny little ball of light. It isn���t light as a particle. However, light is still pretty weird. There is a quantum nature to the electric and magnetic fields in light (quantum theory of radiation). But most of the stuff you look at can be explained using a classical wave model of light and a quantized model for matter.

Appeal to Authority: I admit that sometimes, things get confusing. In case any of my arguments don���t make any sense, I will add some opinions from experts (meaning people that know more than I do).

Perhaps the most recent is this quote from W.E. Lamb, Jr���s paper ���Anti-photon��� - Lamb Jr, Willis E. "Anti-photon." Applied Physics B 60.2-3 (1995): 77-84.:

ADVERTISEMENT

���It is high time to give up the use of the word ���photon���, and of a bad concept which will shortly be a century old. Radiation does not consist of particles and the classical, i.e., non-quantum limit of QTR is described by Maxwell���s Equations for the EM fields, which do not involve particles.���

Or maybe you would like a quote from Einstein himself?

���All these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me no nearer to the answer to the question, ���what are light quanta?��� Nowadays, every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he knows it, but he is mistaken.���

Albert Einstein, letter to Michael Besso 1954.

TL;DR
Yes, this is long. Here are the main points so you don't have to read everything.

Light is awesome.
Most models are wrong at some level. However, they slowly converge to other more correct models.
It is sort of silly to describe light as a particle.
In fact, just about everything you see in undergraduate physics can be explained with a classical wave model of light along with a quantum model of matter.
I���m NOT denying that there is a quantum theory of radiation (QTR). For instance, photon anti-bunching can not be described with a classical EM wave.
ADVERTISEMENT

I wonder if I should put the tl;dr at the beginning. Oh well.

Preemptive Comments
I don���t know why, but I expect some people to not be so happy with this post. In general, people have one of the following two responses to this kind of argument.

We don t Need the Photon   Google Drive

Now for some of the comments you might have.

Are you saying Einstein was wrong? If so, you are crazy. Actually, no. You can describe the photoelectric effect with particles of light. You just don���t need to. Ok fine - Einstein was wrong about the photoelectric effect. He was still a genius and maybe the second greatest physicist that we know of. Newton only edges him out because when he needed new math for his physics, he invented it. When Einstein needed new math, he learned it from mathematicians.
(This is from my brother Neil, he has a comment and a question) You just hate photons like Steve Jobs hates buttons. Can we still talk about photon torpedoes or are you going to ban those too? I don���t hate photons. Hate is a strong word. But yes, you can still use photon torpedoes - but what about "light torpedoes"? Would that work?
What about photon momentum? Most introductory textbooks give a nice explanation of how an electromagnetic wave can push on electrically charged matter. I particularly like the explanation in Matter and Interactions II (Wiley: Chabay and Sherwood). In fact, here is my previous explanation of how light can push a comet's tail.
What about some other particular thing dealing with photons? I will refer you to this very nice paper by David Norwood. There. (The Use and Abuse of "photon" in Nanomechanics - pdf)
Hat Tip to David Norwood. Really, it's his fault that I was thinking about this whole issue. However, he did offer some nice suggestions for this post.

The article discusses the nature of light and whether it should be modeled as a wave or a particle. It explains that both models can be applied to light, but not simultaneously. The wave model describes light as an electromagnetic wave, while the particle model views it as a stream of photons with energy dependent on wavelength and frequency. The text explores multiple models and their applications, discussing concepts from classical and quantum mechanics. It also delves into why the photon model is still used, despite arguments that the classical wave model of light combined with a quantized model for matter can explain most phenomena. The author argues that the term "photon" may be misleading and emphasizes that most models are flawed at some level, converging only slowly to more accurate descriptions. Quotes from experts such as Einstein are used to support the views presented. The piece concludes with the stance that describing light as a particle is unnecessary and perhaps incorrect.

principles  Photons Are Here to Stay, Deal With It
Photons Are Here to Stay, Deal With It

By drorzel on July 12, 2013.
I spend a lot of time promoting Rhett Allain's Dot Physics blog, enough that some people probably wonder if I get a cut of his royalties (I don't). I'm going to take issue with his latest, though, because he's decided to revive his quixotic campaign against photons, or at least teaching about photons early in the physics curriculum. We went through this back in 2008 and 2009 (though Rhett's old posts are linkrotted away, so you only get my side of the story...). I'm no more convinced this time around, even though he drags in Willis Lamb and David Norwood for support.

There are basically two pieces to the anti-photon argument, neither of which I find remotely convincing. In fact, I will happily stipulate that both of the central points are correct, and even after that, I don't find this to be a problem that requires fixing.


The first claim is that photons are redundant, given that you can explain all of the phenomena they're usually invoked to explain without ever referring to particle-like characteristics of light. Which is true-- you can construct a semi-classical model of the photoelectric effect in which electrons inside metals occupy quantized states and are excited out of them by classical electromagnetic waves of the appropriate frequency. That reproduces essentially all of the features of the quantum model proposed by Einstein in 1905 and confirmed by Millikan's experiments in 1916. Using that instead of the photon model would be a little ahistorical-- the semiclassical model was first published by Mandel and Wolf in the 1960's, and relies on a Fermi Golden Rule calculation assuming the Schr��dinger equation which wasn't invented until the late 1920's-- but you could do it.

But even allowing that it's true, I don't see what the point is. To bring it back to classical physics, in the same way that it's perfectly true that you can describe the photoelectric effect with a semiclassical model, it's perfectly true that you can describe an elastic collision between two objects by direct integration of Newton's second law (or the Momentum Principle, in the language of the Matter and Interactions textbook that Rhett and I both use). But there's absolutely no reason to do that, other than to make a philosophical point-- sane people considering elastic collision problems make use of energy in addition to momentum, because it makes the problem simpler.


And that's the case for photons in talking about the photoelectric effect: it's much, much easier. Actually working out the details of the semi-classical model of the photoelectric effect is really complicated: you need to know about the Schr��dinger equation, make a few approximations, and do an integral involving complex numbers. The photon version requires subtraction.

We invoke photons for the photoelectric effect because it's much, much simpler. And since a quantized model of light is known to be necessary to explain photon anti-bunching (a point even Rhett concedes), there's no good reason not to employ it there.

(I'll note in passing that Norwood makes repeated references to some sort of experiment that supposedly shows a delay in electron emission for low light intensity. I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about, and he doesn't provide a citation. The only "delay in photoemission" measurements I'm aware of are attosecond scale delays after excitation with an ultrafast alser pulse, which is not remotely the same thing.)

The second argument against photons basically amounts to the language used to describe light in terms of particles being imprecise in a way that offends some people's aesthetic sense. And, again, strictly speaking this is perfectly true. Photons are not perfectly described as particles with all the properties of classical particles. A proper description is that photons are quantized excitations of particular modes of the electromagnetic field.

But you know what else isn't perfectly described as a particle with all the properties of classical particles? An electron. In fact, strictly speaking, electrons also ought to be described as quantized excitations of an "electron field." There are some differences between the mathematical descriptions of photons and electrons as field excitations, but we've known since Dirac's day that electrons are best described as field quanta.

And yet, you don't find many physicists willing to argue that we shouldn't teach electrons as particles. But all the same linguistic ambiguities are present with electrons that are present with photons. Neither is truly a particle or a wave in the classical sense-- rather, they're both a third kind of object for which we lack a convenient single word. There's necessarily a lot of imprecision in the language used to talk about this; Lamb's article includes a kind of snotty remark blaming Bohr for this, but I don't see any great alternatives.


And even after stipulating that talking about photons as particles is imprecise, I fail to see what the problem is. Or, more specifically, I don't see where this particular bit of imprecision creates a real problem for anything. If this is a pernicious misconception, what is the physical problem that thinking of light in terms of photons keeps you from solving? Where does it lead students astray in a way that gets a clearly wrong answer, as opposed to getting the right answer by aesthetically unappealing means? I haven't seen a good example yet, though this is at least the third time I've read a bunch of anti-photon rants.

So, like the post title says, I see no reason to drop photons. A fully quantized model of light is unquestionably necessary for more advanced experiments, invoking a simplified version of it makes certain classes of intro problems vastly easier to deal with, and the imprecision that the simplified model introduces doesn't seem to cause any significant problems (particularly for the vast majority of students who will only ever take introductory-level classes). There's just nothing there that rises to the level of a problem requiring a change in pedagogy.

(I suspect the closest analogue in classical physics is the "work done by friction" business, where a lot of physics education folks vehemently object to the notion of frictional forces doing work, for reasons I have never quite understood. I've had it explained to me several times, and all I remember about it is that it turns on a poor choice of what you call the system. This has basically eliminated a whole class of problems from the intro classes-- you won't find problems where students find the stopping distance for a sliding object using energy methods any more-- in order to avoid a "misconception" that seems to me to be almost entirely an aesthetic issue.)

As a reference, Art Hobson at U. Arkansas makes an argument for fields over particles:

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.4616.pdf

I continue to think that the particle model has useful relevance, and I think that switching to an all-fields model for introductory physics would make physics all that much more unreachable (and irrelevant, and unfundable) to the "the common people".

Beginners intuitively connect photons in photoelectric effect with billiard balls: "photon in, electron out, we're done here". Discussions of wave properties of photons and electrons rarely connect back to discussions of photons and particles, beyond generic wave-particle duality. To me this summarizes the case against photons: they create a intuitive but incorrect model overpowering the much more important wave model.

A photon doesn't just have energy. It has linear momentum and angular momentum as well. You could presumably construct a field with those properties, but that involves math sufficiently esoteric that it would have to be relegated to a graduate level course. So while it is technically possible to explain all of the relevant physics without resorting to photons, the attempt would likely introduce more problems than it solves.

Conversely, despite never having taken a formal solid state physics course I am aware of the existence of phonons, which are basically quantized sound waves, as a tool for describing certain phenomena. As with photons, this is done because some phenomena are conceptually easier to describe in terms of phonons rather than a field of sound waves. I'll defer to others more knowledgeable than I about the feasibility of eliminating discussion of phonons from solid state courses, but if you think phonons are useful, it is hard to argue that photons are not.

I'm also boggling about the objection to friction forces doing work. What's the alternative description that would be intelligible at the freshman level? I get that invoking friction is a highly simplified description of what's going on, and as with photons vs. fields there is a level where that simplification is inappropriate. But it's rare for such situations to arise at the undergraduate physics level.

The notion of a photon as a particle has some problems, but you need to think pretty deeply about physics, and study it at a pretty high level, to get there. OTOH, you can get started in the lab from day 1 if photons are particles. Indeed, I suspect that even the people who object most loudly to this probably think in terms of photons as particles with (more-or-less-well-defined) energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum when they are trying to understand experiments. I'm a theorist, but experiments are what science is ultimately all about.

As to friction, yeah, I've heard some of those complaints, but the issue never made much sense to me. I get the impression (perhaps mistakenly) that it isn't the newer wave of education researchers who complain about the "work done by friction" thing, so much as an older wave of people who want to "get it right, damnit!" I guess my answer is that if it depends on how we define the system, what part of the surface we call the system, etc., then how can we talk about "work done by gravity"? What part of the earth is pulling on me when I fall? In fact, different parts of the earth are exerting different forces on me, and with different directions even! If we're doing to worry about the fact that different parts of the road are exerting frictional forces on me at different times, then we should worry about the fact that the gravitational force exerted on me by mountains in Canada is mostly northward, not downward. (I'm in the US.)

You can also use a geocentric system to do all of physics if you wish, ideally with the origin of the universal coordinate system right THERE at the corner of a lab bench or your telescope mount. The latter is actually convenient, but not simple, the same issue here.

If Rhett acknowledges that you need photons to explain and/or predict experimental results like photon anti-bunching, then that is the more fundamental theory. What is wrong with deriving Maxwell's Equations from QED? More fundamentally, what is wrong with telling future engineers and future physicists that you can derive Maxwell's Equations from QED but a first year course is not the time or place to do that, anymore than it makes sense to teach Hamiltonian or Lagrangian mechanics to freshmen.

I also really don't get the problem with work by friction. Do they also dispute work done by a gas because of some misconception held by someone? By a hand operated by muscles? By the muscle cells when the hand does not move? If you worry about that, shouldn't you also worry about what "force" means? (The only place where it is clearly defined is in a field theory.) Why does Rhett call gravity a force when the most likely theoretical explanation, necessary for GPS to work, says particles simply follow a geodesic in a model that entirely excludes quantum mechanics? Can you even justify using continuous functions to describe the motion of objects? What experiment tells us that space is continuous?

Yeah, you can go nuts worrying about the foundations of classical mechanics even before you start worrying about the semantic misconceptions inherent in referring to an atom or a proton, let alone a ball, as "a" particle.

What are the arguments?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The arguments in the text revolve around whether photons should be described as particles or not, both in education and in physics modeling. Here's a summary of the main points:
Arguments for Describing Photons as Particles:
Simplicity
: Teaching the concept of photons as particles makes certain problems and phenomena (e.g., the photoelectric effect) easier to explain and understand at an introductory level.
Historical Context
: The particle-like behavior of light has been essential in various historical models and can be connected to experimental results like photon anti-bunching.
Useful Analogy with Other Quantized Phenomena
: Phonons (quantized sound waves) are described in similar terms, and the idea of particles provides a useful conceptual tool for dealing with these phenomena.
Practicality in Experimentation
: Many believe that the notion of photons as particles helps in understanding and conducting experiments, making it a pragmatic choice.
Arguments Against Describing Photons as Particles:
Imprecision and Philosophical Objections
: Some argue that describing photons as particles is imprecise and not fully representative of their quantum nature. A more accurate description is that photons are quantized excitations of the electromagnetic field.
Redundancy
: Critics assert that you can explain all the phenomena attributed to photons without referring to particle-like characteristics. Some even propose that it's possible to explain these phenomena using fields instead of particles.
Misleading Intuition
: There is a concern that treating photons as particles creates intuitive but incorrect models that overpower more accurate wave models.
Potential Confusion
: Some believe that the notion of photons as particles muddles understanding more than it clarifies, and that it's more sensible to define them in terms of experimental detection.
Overall, the debate reflects a tension between the desire for conceptual simplicity and accessibility, especially in educational contexts, and a drive for philosophical and mathematical rigor. While the particle description is seen as an efficient teaching tool and a practical approach, critics argue that it may lead to misconceptions and lacks precision.

The wave-duality of matter shows that any particle exhibits wave like properties
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct! The wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that describes how every particle or quantum entity can be described as both a particle and a wave. This includes not just photons but also other particles like electrons.
For example, electrons can be modeled as particles with specific locations and speeds, but they also exhibit wave-like behavior, such as interference and diffraction. This duality can be experimentally demonstrated using a double-slit experiment.
The concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of quantum systems and requires letting go of some classical intuitions about particles and waves being distinct and non-overlapping categories. It illustrates the richness and complexity of quantum phenomena and is essential in fields such as quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.
