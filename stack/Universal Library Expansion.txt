Universal Library Expansion
Translate to English: La bibliotheca universalis debit in parcia indivinere, post et novum liber singulis omnium pr√¶teritis librorum additione factus erit; etsi autem unus ex his libris totam mundi scientiam contineret, ille qui illum composuit infinitus esset sapientissimus; ideoque dicitur hunc ipsum librum ad horizontem protrahi.

"The universal library owes it to the future to guess in part, and a new book will be made by adding to each of the past books. And even if one of these books were to contain all the knowledge of the world, the person who composed it would still be infinitely wise. Therefore, it is said that this very book is being stretched out to the horizon."
