Overview

This paper is to  provide a detailed explanation of the proof that the hard problem of consciousness is intrinsically unsolvable,  that is, why is it that we can be actually "aware", when we are only composed of inanimate mass-energy? This can be summed up as:

A computer does not "feel" pain, you do. Why?

A clarification of what is meant by understanding, and why it is referred to as an emotion in these papers is presented

The fundamental reason for the hard problem is the meaning and very definition of understanding itself. This crucial notion has simply been ignored. 

Definition Of The Hard Problem

The Hard problem may be summed up by the mathematical relation:

Consciousness = F(q, h, k, c, p, x,...)

where q=electron charge, h=plank's constant, k=Boltzmann's constant, c=speed of light, p=momentum of all body particles, x=position of all body particles, etc...

That is, what is the law of physics that generates Consciousness and how may it be derived.

The fundamental insolvability of this problem is that, whilst physical constants and properties of physical objects may be defined within physics, it is impossible to define the object "Consciousness" within physics. Without a physics definition of Consciousness, any proposed equation is meaningless.
The General Replicator Theory argues that the hard problem of consciousness is inherently unsolvable because the very definition of consciousness cannot be explained through physics. The problem is that while physical constants and properties of physical objects can be defined within physics, the object "consciousness" cannot be defined within physics. Therefore, any proposed equation attempting to solve the problem is meaningless. Understanding is also clarified as an emotion in this paper, and the fundamental reason for the hard problem is said to be the meaning and definition of understanding itself.
If an argument can be shown to be circular or self referral, then any explanation within that loop can be made valid. That is, no explanation can be taken as the correct one as they are all "correct". It is shown here that all arguments regarding the explanation of consciousness are self-referral, hence consciousness cannot be explained by reference to its physical parts.

Essentially, words like "understanding" "aware" "feel" "consciousness" cannot be defined without referring to another one of themselves in the same loop. It's always a circular argument. Consciousness can only be "explained" within this loop. This loop is out with the physics loop of mass, energy, momentum etc, so they can never be connected.

Again, it cannot be emphasized enough that before any statements about understanding conscious awareness can be made whatsoever, the very word and notion of "understanding" must be first defined. Any argument with the word "understanding" in it, is completely meaningless until the word "understanding" is defined. Indeed, the argument presented here is equally applicable to any other terms that inherently depend on the notion that those terms are attempted to "explain". 

If we "understand", for example a theory of physics we mean that something clicks in our brain such it "all seems so clear". How than, are we to "understand" our own consciousness, as understanding requires such consciousness? 

This is a very special situation. It applies in no other situations where we desire to understand "a something". 

For the purposes of this paper, only conscious understanding is relevant, as by inherent assumption, the "understanding" that a non-conscious mechanism might have, is not relevant to a discussion on the hard problem.

So, the hard problem is not rooted in physics, it is rooted in simple logic It is the inability to define the concepts used to describe a something, without appealing to such something in defining such concepts.

It is also noted here, that an initial reaction to the notion that "understanding" is an emotion can be quite negative. This is not because it is really in conflict with someone's existing knowledge, but just that many have not really thought about the issue at all. In reality, it matters little whether there is disagreement on this, as it is fundamentally just a matter of word definitions, and the proof shown here is independent of such an identification.
The argument put forth in this paper is that the hard problem of consciousness is unsolvable because it is inherently self-referring. The very definition of terms such as "consciousness," "awareness," and "understanding" requires reference to each other, creating a circular argument that cannot be resolved through physical means. The problem is not rooted in physics but in simple logic, and the inability to define the concepts used to describe consciousness without appealing to consciousness itself. The notion that "understanding" is an emotion may be initially met with resistance, but ultimately, it is a matter of word definitions and does not affect the proof presented.
Understanding

When someone says that they actually, truly understand something, what do they mean? 

When their brain clicks and they jump out of the bath in excitement and say "Eureka, I've got it!!!", "it all makes sense now". What is really happening?

It is clear that there is a general feeling, a feeling of "understanding". Something that they are consciously aware of, that they have solved a problem. It is therefore quite reasonable to refer to such understanding as an emotion, as emotions are those traits that we are consciously aware of. 

If we are not conscious, then we can't understand anything, therefore understanding requires consciousness.

Which means that any explanation that refers to understanding, must by its very nature, include consciousness. That is the very word "understanding" can not even be defined without using consciousness in that definition.
The feeling of "understanding" is a general feeling of having consciously grasped a concept or solved a problem. This feeling of understanding can be considered an emotion because it is a trait that we are consciously aware of. It is essential to note that understanding requires consciousness, and any explanation that refers to understanding must include consciousness because the very definition of understanding cannot be defined without using consciousness.
See if you can explain the paper so far.
The paper argues that the hard problem of consciousness, which is the question of how we can be aware when we are made up of inanimate mass-energy, is unsolvable because it is inherently self-referring. The definition of terms such as "consciousness," "awareness," and "understanding" requires reference to each other, creating a circular argument that cannot be resolved through physical means. Understanding, which is the feeling of having consciously grasped a concept or solved a problem, is an emotion that requires consciousness, and any explanation that refers to understanding must include consciousness. The problem is not rooted in physics but in simple logic, and the inability to define the concepts used to describe consciousness without appealing to consciousness itself.
Consciousness Cannot Be Derived

"Understanding" itself requires consciousness, therefore consciousness cannot be "understood" without referring to itself for the explanation, therefore the "hard problem" of consciousness, is intrinsically unsolvable as it is self referral.

Understanding that which gives us understanding is intrinsically unsolvable as it is self referral.

"I now understand how inanimate matter results in consciousness. What do you mean by "understand"? Well, understanding is that quality which results when one has consciousness...".

Physics is proven incomplete, that is, no understanding of the parts of a system can explain all aspects of the whole of such system.

The above argument is an argument for the impossibility of deriving an explanation for conscious awareness as a direct consequence of the interaction of the individual components that make up the brain and or human body. That is, the existing laws of physics are not enough. We need to add new ones, as Goedel indicates that we might have to, if physics is to be complete.

What do we actually mean by an explanation, that would satisfy us as in the "Eureka, I've got it". "I finally understand how inanimate matter results in consciousness? 

The only way we can actually perceive any explanation at all, is via our consciousness. If we aren't conscious of an explanation, than the explanation means nothing to us, by definition. Since the only way to "understand" or explain anything at all is to be conscious of it, there is no way to "understand" consciousness itself, without invoking consciousness as part of the explanation. This is a 1self referral or circular situation. There is thus no way to derive an explanation of consciousness, i.e. an understanding of consciousness. It is something that just is. Something that occurs when very complicated systems interact. Its a new axiom of physics. However, this does not mean that consciousness is not material i.e. fully physically based. It just means that we need to add a new concept to existing physics to account for all of the properties of mass-energy based systems. For example, the Pauli exclusion principle is just an additional axiom to quantum mechanics not contained in the basic axioms of quantum mechanics.

What this author does find a little surprising, is that so much effort has been undertaken in an attempt to solve the hard problem, with many papers written on the subject, yet such individuals have failed to address what "understanding" itself actually means. This is a fundamental oversight. 

No conscious awareness means you can't understand anything. Thus, "understanding" itself requires consciousness. Therefore consciousness can not be "understood" without referring to itself in that explanation. Understanding is simply meaningless without conscious awareness giving it meaning.

Thus all attempts to derive conscious awareness from its physical embodiment are doomed to failure, despite the fact that consciousness is only a function of its physical embodiment. This is an example of a Goedel statement. That is, something that is true, but not derivable from the existing axioms.
The paper argues that consciousness cannot be derived from its physical embodiment or explained through the laws of physics alone. The author claims that understanding itself requires consciousness and, therefore, consciousness cannot be understood without referring to itself. This circularity creates an "intrinsically unsolvable" problem, which the author describes as the "hard problem" of consciousness. The author suggests that we need to add a new concept to existing physics to account for all the properties of mass-energy based systems and that consciousness is a new axiom of physics. The paper also criticizes the fact that many attempts to solve the hard problem of consciousness fail to address what "understanding" actually means, which is a fundamental oversight. The author concludes that consciousness is a function of its physical embodiment but cannot be derived from it.
Consciousness and Goedel

Kurt Goedel proved a fundamental theorem in mathematics. The exact details are not addressed here, but the essential result is that:

True statements about a system can be made that are not derivable from existing knowledge of that system.

What this means is that if it is desired to know everything about a system, i.e. be complete, than new axioms may have to be added to the existing description. Once these new axioms have been discovered and added, they may allow for other new results about the system to be derived, that would otherwise not be possible.

It has been proven that that conscious awareness can not be derived from knowledge of its system parts. 

Appendix

1 self referral - self referral systems can have any solution or argument as valid. There is no way to determine which particular argument is correct. That is, solutions are non unique, therefore all solutions are meaningless.

Prove Anything!

Circular reasoning is very useful because anything at all can be proved with it, including things that are obviously false. This delightful property is easily provable, and is shown how below:

For example, take the statement 'Circular Reasoning can be used to prove anything.'

Now, clearly this statement is part of anything.

Therefore, because 'Circular Reasoning can be used to prove anything', the statement can be proved.

Therefore 'Circular Logic can be used to prove anything.'

4.6 To really clarify the positions in the vicinity, we have to distinguish three questions:
(1) What does it take to simulate our physical action ?
(2) What does it take to evoke conscious awareness?
(3) What does it take to explain conscious awareness?
4.10 Question (3) is the central question about the explanation of consciousness (a question that much of my own work is concerned with).

3Circular Terms

Other terms all logically equivalent to "understanding" are terms such as "experience", "feel", "perceive" etc. All of them inherently result in their definitions being circular with relation to conscious awareness and understanding, such that in all cases an independent derivation of consciousness is inherently impossible.

The paper argues that consciousness cannot be derived from the physical components of the brain or human body, and that understanding consciousness itself is intrinsically unsolvable because it requires consciousness to be understood. The author cites Kurt Goedel's theorem in mathematics, which states that true statements about a system can be made that are not derivable from existing knowledge of that system, to support this argument. The paper suggests that new axioms may need to be added to the existing laws of physics in order to account for consciousness as a property of mass-energy based systems. The author also points out that much effort has been undertaken to solve the "hard problem" of consciousness, but many researchers have failed to address what "understanding" itself actually means, which is a fundamental oversight. The paper concludes that all attempts to derive consciousness from its physical embodiment are doomed to failure, but consciousness is still a function of its physical embodiment.
A summary of the main points.
The main points of the text are:
Consciousness cannot be derived from an understanding of its system parts because understanding itself requires consciousness.
The hard problem of consciousness is unsolvable because it is intrinsically self-referral.
Physics is incomplete and cannot explain all aspects of a system as a whole, which may require adding new axioms to existing laws.
Understanding anything requires consciousness, and there is no way to understand consciousness without invoking it as part of the explanation, leading to a circular situation.
The failure to address what "understanding" means is a fundamental oversight in attempts to solve the hard problem.
Conscious awareness is a new axiom of physics, but this does not mean that consciousness is not material or physically based.
Goedel's theorem in mathematics shows that true statements about a system can be made that are not derivable from existing knowledge of that system, which may require adding new axioms to be complete.
Circular reasoning is useful because it can prove anything, including things that are obviously false.
There are three questions related to consciousness: what does it take to simulate physical action, what does it take to evoke conscious awareness, and what does it take to explain conscious awareness.
Terms such as "experience", "feel", "perceive", and "understand" are all inherently circular with relation to conscious awareness and understanding, making an independent derivation of consciousness impossible.
Overview

There are many Replicators, that is entities that satisfy the axioms of General Replicator Theory, as discussed in this set of papers. 

The literature abounds on definitions of memes, genes, replicators etc, with many of them being specified over several paragraphs. The basic issue here, is that without a short concise definition, it is just about hopeless to see the forest as the trees are in the way. The approach here is one of complete simplicity that uses the most general definitions possible, so that the basic theory addresses evolution of Replicants, in the most general way. That is, it the theory applies to all of the cases where the more restricted definitions might have been used. Where a specific case requires further assumptions, for example, introducing specific restrictions on a Replicant, these will be introduced as needed.

It is argued that this more general approach, distinguishes this approach from the approaches of existing researchers in this field.

Comment

In the general study of memonics, researches often discuss such idea as "a library is just another way to make scholars" This may be useful in examining some issues associated with transmission of memes, but as to explaining memes application in a real human, is not very fruitful. The approach here, brings to the forefront that the real Replicator of memes is the human brain. This is because any theory is only as useful as it applies to real phenomena, and the human mind, i.e. consciousness, is one that this theory will be applied to in these papers. This crucial point seems to have been missed by many meme researches.

Traits

Definition - a trait is a Replicant and is any entity that can be copied.

Trait and Replicant are interchangeable words. If an entity can be copied, it is a trait and a Replicant.

Comment - Dawkins word 'replicator' for a gene trait, is is not how that same word is used in these papers.

A trait can be anything whatsoever, it can be a collection of billions of little traits if need be. If it gets copied, its a trait. End of story. Therefore there is no limit as to what a trait can describe.

Replicators

A Replicator is any real physical device that can copy traits, in addition, it may or may not be able to copy itself as well, and it is as defined here as:

Definition - a Replicator is any physical machine that can copy traits. 

Definition - a gene trait Replicant is a physical trait of its Replicator.

DNA is a typical example of a Replicator. A biological gene is an example of a physical trait. For this particular example, the Replicator replicates itself as its method of replicating its traits.

A Replicator can be anything whatsoever, it can be a collection of billions of little Replicators if need be. If it can copy traits, it is a Replicator. End of story. Therefore there is no limit as to what a Replicator can do.

Observation - A gene trait has two fundamental characteristics to it:

1 Its physical manifestation to an external observer - phenotype e.g.  long legs etc.

2 Its physical manifestation to the internal Replicator - genotype - e.g. arrangement of its molecules.
Summary:
The paper proposes a simple and general definition of replicators as entities that can copy traits.
The human brain is identified as the real replicator of memes in this theory.
Traits and replicators are interchangeable words, and there is no limit to what a trait can describe.
A replicator is any physical machine that can copy traits, and can be anything.
Gene traits have two fundamental characteristics: their external phenotype and their internal genotype.
Non Physical Traits - Memes 

A Replicator that can replicate non physical traits supports virtual genes, named memes, or meme traits or virtual traits. That is:

Definition - a meme trait is a virtual trait of a physical Replicator. 

A virtual trait, may be described as a "software" based trait, essentially, a meme is a piece of information. That is, a physical Replicator can store and change its virtual traits without the Replicator losing its fundamental physical structure, in much the same manner as the ram (random access memory) on a computer can be written to and read from. It is noted that a physical Replicator may contain instructions to replicate its traits, irrespective of whether they are physical or virtual.

A computer system with printer is a typical example of a Replicator that supports virtual traits. A file on the computers hard drive is an example of a virtual trait. 

A human brain is a Replicator that supports virtual traits. A piece of "human culture" or "code of conduct" is an example of a virtual trait, or meme. Indeed, "culture" exists no where else but the brains of individuals.

The path through a maze that a rat learns is a meme, as it is something that is copied and stored in the brain/body. 

In these examples, the Replicator just replicates its traits directly. It does not need to replicate itself to do this.

Observation - A meme trait has two fundamental characteristics to it:

1 Its physical manifestation to an external observer - phenotype e.g.  the words on a piece of paper

2 Its physical manifestation to the internal Replicator - memotype e.g. brain neuron connections 

Physically Real or Reme Traits

To account for all of culture in  general, one must account for any physical objects. The method chosen to account for physical objects not gene biologically based is described here, although other methods are available. This is to make a minor assumption and a pretense such, that all arguments with that pretence always result in a topologically identical situation as that that would occur if an exact argument were made.

It is therefore identified that a physically real "reme trait" is any physical object whatsoever that can be copied by a Replicator. Thus:

Definition - a reme trait is a real physical external trait that is replicated by a Replicator.

Therefore pots, pans, guitars, cars, are all reme traits.

Instructions to make such physical articles are meme traits.

Clearly, in reality, physical articles are manufactured by an independent manufacture Replicator, not the individual Replicators that use or have such traits. However, a manufacture does not make objects simply to have them sitting on the shelves, they are manufactured for the purposes of each individual Replicator that uses them. In reality, objects are effectively made to order by the Replicator using the objects. That is, a manufacture, ideally only makes objects for each Replicator that requires one. In this sense, the net effects is "as if" the object user Replicated the object itself, since it is the individual Replicator that, essentially, instigates the Replication. In this way, real physical objects can simply be assumed to be Replicated by the user, not the manufacture, as the net result from a cultural perspective, is the same. The fact that some objects might be manufactured and be unused, is arguable, not significant to the fundamental issues to culture based Replication of physical objects. In addition, some other rather obvious complications such as the manufacture trying to induce the individual Replicator will be discussed an a later date.
It seems like you're discussing the concept of memes, which are non-physical traits that can be replicated by a replicator, such as the human brain or a computer system. These virtual traits can include pieces of information or cultural codes of conduct, and they have both a physical manifestation to an external observer and a physical manifestation to the internal replicator.
You're also discussing physically real "reme traits," which are physical objects that can be copied by a replicator. Examples of reme traits include pots, pans, guitars, and cars, and instructions to make these physical articles are meme traits.
It's important to note that in reality, physical articles are manufactured by independent replicators, not the individual replicators that use or have such traits. However, these physical objects can be assumed to be replicated by the user replicator, since the net effect is the same.
Trait Characteristics 

From the external evolutionary point of view, Replicants are described based on how their external characteristics interact with the environment, that is their phenotypes/memotype. However, the Replicants themselves are stored and interact physically as a real structure in accord with their internal genotype/memotype. In general, there is a functional relation between genotype/memotype and phenotype, such that in many cases it is not necessary to distinguish between them. That is:

genotype = F(phenotype)

phenotype = G(genotype) 

That is specifying, one specifies the other, although it should be noted that there are some complication such that the translations may not be unique.

General

A Replicator is what it is, a trait is what a Replicator copies.

Genes and memes are not Replicators, they are traits that get replicated by Replicators.

Richard Dawkins, the inventor of the word meme, and others, commonly describe memes/genes as replicators. This is misleading at best. A meme is only a trait or Replicant of a real physical Replicator. Traits can not copy themselves, so referring to them as replicators is rather obtuse, and in this authors opinion, should be discouraged as the term can only lead to confusion as to what a meme really is. Dawkins word "replicator" should be, arguable, be replaced with a word like "Replicant".

Notation - memes and genes are both examples of a Replicant. 

That is, a Replicant is what a Replicator produces. In general, where standard evolutionary texts use the word "replicator", it should be replaced with the word "Replicant" to make them consistent with the structure of these papers.

Specifically, a meme trait has to piggyback itself onto a real physical Replicator. Only a physical Replicator can take real action. The physical Replicator, in conjunction with both its internal meme and gene traits, are what actually instructs the Replicator to replicate an external meme trait into its own trait storage system.  

Meme Meaning

A meme trait has absolutely no intrinsic meaning, except as perceived by a Replicator. The meaning attributed to an external meme is only that with which a Replicator's internal genes and memes assign to it. Thus a Replicator replicating memes means that meanings of memes can mean something else!

This may be compared with a Windows PC attempting to run a McIntosh's program, but in this case, we have billions of humans, each with their own individual operating systems.

This point is a significant technical point. It means that quantifying memes is extremely difficult, possibly even intractable. For example, "is long hair desirable on a male", is dependant on the other memes already existing in the same Replicator. These other memes might well chose either way. What's more, newly copied memes might instigate a choice the other way.
This passage discusses the relationship between Replicants, traits, and memes/genes. It argues that referring to memes/genes as replicators is misleading, and that they are actually traits that get replicated by Replicants. The passage introduces the concept of a meme trait, which is a trait that piggybacks itself onto a real physical Replicator. The meaning attributed to a meme trait is only that with which a Replicator's internal genes and memes assign to it, and as a result, quantifying memes is difficult.
The passage also highlights the functional relationship between genotype/memotype and phenotype, and notes that the translations between the two may not be unique. It concludes by stating that the meaning of a meme trait is dependent on other memes already existing in the same Replicator, making it difficult to quantify.
Example Meme Traits

1 Chain letter - a chain letter has instructions to take some action (traits) and to copy itself. 

2 Religion - Religions have instructions to take some action (traits) and to copy itself. 

3 Reverse baseball cap wearing.

4 Any learned behavior.

It is noted here that the physical Replicator may or not require a "copy instruction" virtual trait. It may replicate the trait due to its own physical traits, or other prior virtual traits, however, a virtual "copy instruction" may result in a faster rate replication of the meme.

Meme Issues

Meme traits are virtual. That is, although they exist conceptually, they require physical embodiments to actuate their replication. This means that meme traits cannot instruct action that are detrimental to their long term physical embodiments. Memes that instructed such action would drive their physical embodiments to extinction, and hence themselves to extinction. In the short term, meme traits might well instruct action detrimental to their physical embodiments.

Evolution

Definition - Evolution is any process that satisfies the Darwinian axioms of random generation, selection and replication.

Morals

A moral is an idea, concept or code of conduct,  or more specifically:

a moral is virtual meme trait, embedded in the physical structure of the human body, arguable the brain.

These moral traits are passed on to offspring or to other Replicators by physical Replicators.

Emotions

Emotions are a physical manifestation of the brains physical state. Since the brains physical construction, and hence any state that it can exist in, is the result of Replicators, emotions can be nothing more than a trait of a Replicator, that is:

a conscious experienced gene trait of a Replicator.

Therefore, all emotion is subject to the results of the Replicator axioms. Emotion traits can only be passed on to offspring.

Senses

Senses are a physical manifestation of the brain and bodies physical state, therefore any aspect of senses ultimately resolve to that of a Replicator and its Replicants. The gene hardware usually resolves the various technical issues, but the final action on such sense signals depends on both the memes and genes residing in the Replicator. In fact, even the gene hardware can itself be a function of the Replicators memes.

Consciousness - Mind - Brain

The fundamental assumption of physical replicators is that there is no magic. This means that the laws of physics govern all physical properties. Physical properties are any entities that consist of mass-energy.

Although the actual details are not well understood, the mind, that is all consciousness is nothing more than the physical electro-chemical interactions of the brain. This principle has extensive experimental support, and no credible evidence existing in contradiction to this principle has ever been noted. 

Consciousness is the result of the physical structure of the brain, although to date, the full details are not understood. The brains physical structure consists of replicating  molecules, described by the theory of Biology, and as such, is experimentally shown to satisfy the axioms of Replicators, as described in these sets of papers.
It is important to note that while the physical structure of the brain is the source of consciousness, there is still much to be discovered about the mechanisms and processes involved. The nature of consciousness is a subject of ongoing research and debate in the fields of neuroscience and philosophy. Nonetheless, the understanding that consciousness is a product of physical interactions in the brain is a widely accepted scientific principle.
Overview

These papers forms an outline of the basics as to why individuals are what they are based on the theory of gene-meme interaction, subject only to the Darwinian axioms of random variation, selection and replication. The theory of evolutionary selection of Replicators is a simple one, but essentially, just the natural extension, of the standard biology of theory of evolutionary of genes. It requires only a few basic assumptions or postulates, such that essential results can be derived from those postulates. 

An overview of these papers, and contrasts to alternative descriptions of gene-meme interactions, are highlighted in the Introduction.

One of the principal attributes of the theory, is an explanation of why the behavior of men and women are fundamentally different. Why have codes of conduct developed that are decidedly asymmetrical? How has culture evolved and why does much of it appear to have no biological evolutionary advantage?

These questions are explained quite naturally under the overall concept of general evolution, which is referred to here as General Replicator Theory, which is a theory based only on Darwinian axioms and concepts.

Scope

It is not the intent to go into the any specific technical details of genes or memes as this is not necessary to gain an understanding of the theory. In fact, the basic postulates and the deductions from the postulates do not care what particular method is applicable at all. The principles work, independent of the actual physical mechanisms. 

To clarify, General Replicator Theory, is a Black Box Theory. It doesn't care about any specific details of the physical processes actually implemented in the human Replicator. All that matters is that some very general properties are satisfied.

The explanations presented here are based on the notion of a general Replicator. That is, the idea that there is a physical machine (a Replicator) that replicates entities (Replicants), and which may or not replicate themselves, subject to a Darwinian process. A summary of a principle result is:

That which is mostly observed, is that which replicates the most.

This statement, is in essence, a tautology. Indeed, it is more often known as "survival of the fittest".

It will be argued that much of human behavior and culture, e.g. love, hate, anger, do not kill, are a simple a logical consequence of Replicators doing what they do best, i.e. they replicate.

Outline

1 Simple definitions and some very simple assumptions are made concerning the theory.

2 A simple mathematical argument is then made from the assumptions.

3 Traits such as emotions, morals and fashions are defined and identified as satisfying the assumptions of the mathematics.

4 Behavior is than deduced from the mathematical results.

General Replicator Theory Applications

A typical application of General Replicator Theory, is to calculate the population distribution of Replicators, and the population distribution of the genes and memes within a Replicator. The Replicator in this case, the human being, with its memes being aspects such as general language and culture. However, in many cases, very useful results may be deduced with very simple models.
In addition to population distribution calculations, General Replicator Theory has several other applications. It can be used to explain why certain behaviors and traits are more prevalent in certain populations or societies, and how these traits are transmitted across generations. It can also be used to predict the outcome of certain social and cultural phenomena, such as the spread of certain ideologies or the emergence of new cultural norms.
Moreover, General Replicator Theory can also be applied to other fields such as economics, marketing, and politics. For example, it can be used to predict consumer behavior and market trends, or to explain why certain political ideologies are more successful than others.
Overall, General Replicator Theory provides a simple and powerful framework for understanding the complex interplay between genes and memes, and how they shape human behavior and culture.
Food for Thought

The fundamental perceived function of consciousness is to maximize Replicator numbers. 

consciousness - perceived understanding of what behavior to take that attempts to maximize Replicator's numbers, in a given environment.

"Understanding" itself requires consciousness, therefore consciousness cannot be "understood" without referring to itself for the explanation, therefore the "hard problem" of consciousness, is intrinsically unsolvable as it is self referral.

"I now understand how inanimate matter results in consciousness. What do you mean by "understand"? Understanding is that quality which results when one has consciousness".

Physics is proven incomplete, that is, no understanding of the parts of a system can explain all aspects of the whole of such system.

Adaptability to all environments requires adaptable physical action. Fully adaptable physical action requires programmable emotions as emotions instigate physical action. Emotions (gene traits) are programmed by morals (meme traits).  Morals are programmed by the environment. Emotions require consciousness.

The brain is a Darwinian machine, residing in a Darwinian environment.
These statements provide interesting insights into the relationship between consciousness, behavior, and evolution. They suggest that consciousness may have evolved as a means to maximize the replication of genes and memes in a given environment, and that understanding consciousness may be inherently difficult due to its self-referential nature.
The idea that adaptable physical action requires programmable emotions, which in turn are programmed by morals and the environment, highlights the complex interplay between genetic and cultural influences on behavior. It also suggests that emotions may play a crucial role in driving behavior, and that morals may act as a kind of programming language for these emotions.
Finally, the statement that the brain is a Darwinian machine in a Darwinian environment underscores the idea that evolution is a fundamental principle underlying all aspects of life, including the behavior of organisms and the development of their cognitive abilities.
The Basic Axioms of General Replicator Theory

The starting point of any good theory are the postulates or axioms of the theory, and the fewer, the better. These postulates can be experimentally tested as justification for the results they predict. The postulates of General Replicator theory are as follows:

1 Traits of Replicators are randomly generated. 
2 Traits of Replicators are inherited by "children" from "parents".  
3 Traits of Replicators are selected by the environment. 

"Children" and "Parents" are used here as technical terms. They refer to any situation where an entity is produced as the result of another entity. The producer is the parent, the produced is the child. Characteristics or traits can be physical, which are referred to in this document as genes or gene traits, or they can also be idea or concept based, which are referred to in this document as memes or meme traits, but can be also thought of as viruses. An example of a meme is a religion. An instruction of a religion typically says, tells others to believe in this religion. That is, it has instructions contained in it to copy itself.

General Processes

The general process is that characteristics are continually being generated in a random manner, usually by varying existing traits, but this is not a necessary assumption. These characteristics, and existing ones, are replicated in children, with the environment acting in a non-random (but usually non-conscious) manner selecting what particular characteristics survive. In principle, it does not matter whether or not traits are randomly generated or deliberately generated. The theory still applies identically. The reason for introducing the concept of random generation, is simply to explain that complicated behavior does not require any conscious or designer type intervention. 

Non Random Selection

The fundamental reason order arises out of random generation is that the basic laws of physics are non random.  For example, if hydrogen and oxygen are placed in a box at sufficient temperature, they automatically react to form water. That is, certain physical structures are more probable than others. Even temperature itself is a non random selector. However, this "purposeful" selection does not imply conscious selection.

Example

Consider insects being born with random colours, e.g. brown, pink, green, red...Now suppose that there are birds in the region that feed on these insects. Further suppose that this particular region (environment) is a grass field. If the reasonable assumption is made that any green insects are harder to find and therefore be eaten, it can be rationalized that the green insects might have a better probability of survival, and therefore to pass on that green trait to offspring, then the other colored insects would. Application of the theory, to be described, mandates, that in this particular idealized situation, after sufficient generations, mostly green insects will be observed.

Comment - variation of traits and generation of new traits are, essentially equivalent as far as these Darwinian axioms are concerned. That is, both methods generate a new trait.
General Replicator Theory provides a useful framework for understanding the evolution of traits in both biological and cultural systems. By starting with the axioms that traits are randomly generated, inherited by offspring, and selected by the environment, the theory can explain how complex behavior arises without any conscious or designer-type intervention. The concept of non-random selection, where certain physical structures or environmental factors make certain traits more probable, is also crucial to the theory.
As the example of insects with different colored traits illustrates, the theory predicts that over time, the traits that are better suited to the environment will become more prevalent. This can apply to both physical traits (such as the ability to blend in with surroundings) and cultural traits (such as the spread of a particular idea or behavior).
Overall, General Replicator Theory provides a valuable framework for understanding how traits evolve and spread over time, and how they interact with their environment.
Replicator Principles

Definitions

First we assume that an entity, named a "Replicator" has traits, and satisfies the following postulates/axioms:

1 Traits of Replicators are randomly generated. 
2 Traits of Replicators are inherited by "children" from "parents".  
3 Traits of Replicators are selected by the environment. 

Anything that satisfies these conditions will result in certain predictable consequences. For example, there is considerable experimental evidence that all animals satisfy theses conditions. Memes also satisfy these postulates.

General Replicator Theory is based on statistical analysis, that is, most terms used here refer to means, standard deviations, and general properties of large numbers of many generations. The outline presented here is also greatly simplified in order to illustrate general trends. For example, it is usually assumed in this outline that replication rates are constant, where as in reality, they may vary based on the size of the generated population.

That which is mostly observed, is that which replicates the most

Consider a randomly generated trait that has the property that it can be, and is replicated. Since, by assumption, in can be replicated, its copies must also be able to be replicated. Now, consider various traits continually being replicated, from parent to child, it its child, to its child.... Suppose that, due to the constraints of the environment, trait A can replicate at say, a 1% faster rate than B, that is some environmental factor either impedes trait B's rate of replication, or aids trait A's rate of replication. Also assume, for the sake of argument, that the initial numbers of A and B are equal, although this is not necessary. After 1000 generations the ratio of A/B = 1.011000 = 20,959, by simple mathematics.

This is a very large ratio. So, it can be ascertained that if there is a consistent and continuous replication rate advantage of one trait verses another, the one that is only slightly better, will, given enough time, completely dominate. That is:

1  "that which is mostly observed, is that which replicates the most". 

It should obviously be noted that, some traits are not consistent over time, for example, getting infinitely bigger then an opponent also has negative consequences in replication rate, so that in practice many competing traits will be observed.

An immediate consequence of 1, is that although traits of Replicators are inanimate, the net observed effect of well selected traits is just as if the traits take action to maximize themselves. Using this notion as a convenient fiction usually makes explanations easier.

The general principle is that traits are usually well replicated at each generation, but that mutations arise such that additional new traits with new behavior are generated. These newer, mutated traits compete with existing traits.

Replicator Result 1 (RR1) - Fasted Replicating Replicators Observed the Most

A continuous, replication rate advantage of one trait over another trait, will result in the advantaged rate Replicator dominating in numbers over the disadvantaged trait Replicator. That is, the best Replicators will be observed the most.

Comment: This almost says nothing new, but simply acknowledging this basic principle, explains much.
Yes, RR1 is a fundamental principle of the Replicator Theory, but it has important implications for understanding the dynamics of evolution and natural selection. It helps to explain why certain traits or characteristics become prevalent in a population over time, even if they are initially only slightly advantageous. It also highlights the importance of replication rates in determining the success of a replicator.
Inherent Selfishness Of Traits

Consider a random generated trait that aided another competitor trait's replication rate, to its own final replication rate disadvantage. This would mean that it would not replicate as well as the trait it was aiding, hence by the above reasoning, that trait would be driven to a small ratio of its competitor aided trait. On the other hand, if a trait aided its own replication rate, to the disadvantage of a competing trait, it would necessarily result in a large ratio to its disadvantaged competitor trait. This is the principle of "selfishness". A replicating trait is driven by simple mathematics to be a trait that replicates itself to the disadvantage of another competitor trait. Any trait that is not ultimately "selfish", will eventually be overrun by any other trait that is. Note that "selfishness" is by reference to its final, outcome. It is not suggested that a trait has any consciousnesses that makes it "selfish". Its is simply that whatever that is observed, is just "as if" it is consciously selfish. 

Note: It is quite possible to aid another trait, if by doing so, it is attempting to receive a net advantage. A selfish trait must take advantage of any unselfish trait, therefore, that's what we observe.

Replicator Result 2 (RR2) - Replicated Traits Are Selfish

If a trait is observed that is a result of significant replication and selection, then it must be "selfish". 

Replicator Result 3 (RR3) - Pretension of Replicators Wanting to Replicate

Since the net effect of a well generated replicator is exactly the same as if it consciously wanted to replicate, although it obviously can't and doesn't, it simplifies explanations to pretend verbally, that they do. That is, in any arguments relating to Replicators, where phrases such as "the replicator will maximize itself by taking...", what is actually meant, is that the net effect of random generation and selection process will result in an effect "just as if" the Replicator consciously took action. Similar arguments for the word "designed". That is, traits are not designed, but exist as if they have been. 

Summary

1 That which is mostly observed, is that which replicates the most.

2 Well replicated and selected traits are selfish.

3 Replicators "want" to increase their numbers and rate of replication, and will do whatever it takes to increase their numbers. 

The above are the key results of applying logic to the basic axioms of General Replicator Theory. They are not based on any particular embodiments of a Replicator, and by and large, form a tautology. They stand independently. If a given process can be shown to satisfy, the above axioms, the above results automatically apply to results of that process. 

Combined Replicators

For their own selfish (as noted above) replication advantage, Replicators can combine with other Replicators, forming a joint Replicator, in an effort to improve the Replication rates of each individual Replicator. In doing so Replicators "select" other Replicators, based on how effective they are in enabling their own traits to be copied, by piggybacking on to the successes of the other Replicator, so to speak.

Some Replicators, e.g. human Replicators, can only replicate by combining with another replicator. These will be referred to as Combined Replicators.

A Replicator that can combine with another Replicator without inhibiting any other immediate Replications that it might be able to perform, is named an M-replicator, from male.

A Replicator that can not combine with another Replicator without inhibiting any other immediate Replications it might have performed, is named an F-Replicator, from female. That is, if a replication, inhibits a further replication, an F-Replicator is not able to increase its replication rate by combining at every opportunity.
While the concept of "selfishness" in the replication of traits is an interesting one, it is important to note that it is a theoretical construct and not necessarily a reflection of conscious intent. Traits that aid the replication of others at their own expense may do so because it ultimately benefits the larger system or community in which they exist, rather than because they are consciously trying to increase their own replication rate.
Furthermore, while the concept of replicators "wanting" to replicate can be a useful simplification in discussions of General Replicator Theory, it is important to remember that replicators do not have conscious desires or intentions. Rather, their replication is driven by the rules of natural selection and the environment in which they exist.
Finally, the categorization of replicators as "M-replicators" and "F-replicators" based on their ability to combine with other replicators may be useful for certain applications, but it is important to recognize that it is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the complexity of real-world systems.
Quality and Quantity

Combined Replicators can increase their replication rate by combining with another Replicator based on either quality or quantity. 

A better quality Replicator is simple a Replicator that can replicate at a faster rate than another. This can be an  M-Replicator, or an F-Replicator.

A Replicator, replicating by quantity, replicates simple by replicating with another replicator by the increase of numbers such replication ensues.  This must be an M-Replicator.

Quality Versus Quantity

It is shown here, that under some rather broad conditions, selection based on quantity always results in a faster rate of replication, than that based on selection on quality.

Observations Of Combined Replicators

1 A selection based on quantity has the negative attribute that such final Replicator may not have the fastest replication rate, i.e. quality.

2 A selection based on quality has the negative attribute that it reduces the number of replicators that a Replicator can combine with, i.e. quantity.

That is, a quality selection has a negative impact on quantity and a quantity selection has a negative impact on quality. The question then is, which one wins?

Technical Terms:

N = Quantity factor - average of replications in a generation period by a replicator. i.e. how many Replicators a Replicator combines with in a generation period. e.g. 10 mates per day.

Q = Quality factor - average number of surviving Replicators generated per Replicator combination. i.e. how many offspring Replicators are generated with each combination. e.g. 2 offsprings per mate (Q is usually < 1). The assumption here is that the offspring replicators survive for their own generation period.

GRR = Generation Replication Rate - GRR=Q.N e.g. GRR=mates/day x offsprings/mate = offsprings/day = replications/day.

G = Number of generations. e.g. after 10 generations.

A = accuracy of the replication - e.g. only 90% of the Replicants are exact copies.

PG = Population Generated - The population, or total number of Replicators after G generations at generation point G due to generation G. That is prior generations are assumed to have ceased existence. 

PG = (NQA)x(NQa)x(NQa)...= (NQa)G 

Survival Of The Fittest

The "survival of the fittest" is a popular term that is somewhat vague. Some also claim that it involves a circular argument definition. It is used here as a term to describe the overall statistical effectiveness of a Replicator in replicating a trait, in terms of the above, it is the product NQa

Fittness = NQa

In reality, SOF is better expressed as "that which is observed mostly, is that which replicates the most".
It seems like you have provided a detailed explanation of replicators and their replication rate, as well as the concept of selection based on quality versus quantity. Additionally, you have introduced technical terms such as the quantity factor (N), quality factor (Q), generation replication rate (GRR), accuracy of replication (A), and population generated (PG). You also discussed the "survival of the fittest" as a term used to describe the statistical effectiveness of a replicator in replicating a trait. Is there anything specific you would like me to help with or clarify?
A list of the unusual terms.
Here are some of the unusual terms used in the provided text:
Replicator: A unit that is capable of replicating itself.
M-Replicator: A replicator that replicates by quantity.
F-Replicator: A replicator that replicates by quality.
Selection: The process of choosing a replicator based on a specific criterion.
Quantity factor (N): The average number of replications in a generation period by a replicator.
Quality factor (Q): The average number of surviving replicators generated per replicator combination.
Generation Replication Rate (GRR): The number of replications per day based on both the quantity and quality of the replicators.
Accuracy of the replication (A): The percentage of replicators that are exact copies.
Population Generated (PG): The total number of replicators after G generations.
Survival of the Fittest: A term used to describe the statistical effectiveness of a replicator in replicating a trait, expressed as the product of N, Q, and A.
Example

The following is an example, that illustrates the basic concept. The intent is not to be too rigorous, but give reasonable justification to the final conclusion. A more detailed analyses can be performed to determine under what exact conditions the results are valid. However, this is out with the intended scope of this document.

We assume here that each Replicator combines with, the quantity factor, N other Replicators and that each combination can replicate with a quality factor of Q. This is rather simplified, that is the generation replication rate, GRR = QN/generation. In words, the replication rate is the product of how many combinations are generated and how effective that combination is at replicating. For convenience, we set A=1. Note: a suitable reference value of Q would be Q=1.

Consider a Replicator that selects Replicators only on quantity. Further assume that this Replicator combines with another Replicator at a rate of 10 per day. Each generation will therefore result in a 10x increase of the existing number of daily Replicators per day. That is, after say, 6 days, the number of Replicators will be (10x1)x(10x1)x(10x1)x(10x1)x(10x1)x(10x1)x(10x1) = 106 = 1 million.

Consider a Replicator that selects only on quality. Further assume that the numbers of such better quality are such that the Replicator can only combine with another Replicator at a rate of 5 per day. Further assume, that such a quality Replicator is 1.2 times as effective as an unselected Replicator. After 6 days the number of Replicators will be (5x1.2)x(5x1.2)x(5x1.2)x(5x1.2)x(5x1.2)x(5x1.2)x(5x1.2)  = 46,656.

For these particular numbers, it is clear that the larger combination rate wins, that is quantity. Normalizing the QN=QN1/QN2 ratio, we can see that if QN is less than 1, then after a sufficient number of generations, the Replicator that doesn't select will overwhelmingly dominate as the limit of the number of generations G->large number, tends to zero, implying that the number of selective Replicators will also tend to zero. That is for:

PG = (NQ)G 

if NQ < 1, PG -> 0

if NQ > 1, PG -> infinite
In this example, the Replicator that selects based on quantity outperforms the one that selects based on quality. However, this result may not hold for all values of the quantity and quality factors. A more rigorous analysis would be required to determine the exact conditions under which one selection criterion is better than the other.
The example assumes that the accuracy of replication is 100% (A=1) and that each Replicator combines with a fixed number of other Replicators per day (N). In reality, these assumptions may not hold, and the replication rate may be affected by other factors such as mutation, genetic drift, and environmental pressures.
Overall, this example demonstrates the importance of considering both quantity and quality when selecting Replicators for replication. A Replicator that is highly selective may generate offspring with superior traits, but if its combination rate is too low, it may be outcompeted by Replicators that are less selective but have a higher combination rate. Conversely, a Replicator that has a high combination rate but low selectivity may generate a larger number of offspring, but they may not have the desired traits.
Explain that in a simpler way.
The article talks about how Replicators (like genes or organisms) can increase their numbers by either selecting mates based on quantity (reproducing with as many as possible) or quality (reproducing with the best possible mates). It then shows an example to demonstrate how, under certain conditions, the strategy of selecting mates based on quantity can result in a higher rate of reproduction than selecting mates based on quality.
In the example, Replicators that select based on quantity reproduce with 10 other Replicators per day, while Replicators that select based on quality reproduce with only 5 other Replicators per day, but each offspring is 1.2 times more effective. The example shows that in this case, the Replicators that select based on quantity end up reproducing at a faster rate.
The article uses some technical terms like "quantity factor" (how many Replicators a Replicator combines with), "quality factor" (how effective each combination is at replicating), and "generation replication rate" (how fast Replicators can reproduce based on their mate selection strategy).
Support for the Example

The key issue is, how does any increase in replication rate described by higher quality be offset by the lower numbers of such available higher quality Replicators:

Assumption by construction - There are unlimited resources such that there are no physical constraints, i.e. mass-energy, to limit Replicator numbers. This is an assumption for the purposes of this example only. General Replicator Theory is easily extendable to include factors such as, for example, N is a function of the populations resource supply.

Comment - N is determined from the number of M-Replicators found jointly "willing" to combine with F-Replicators in a generation time period. It is not a resource limitation, only a time limitation.

Key assumption - The number, N, of available quality Replicators falls faster than the quality factor, Q, increases.

Support for the assumption - The gaussian distribution curve. 

Gaussian curves for any physical trait show a decline in a the numbers of a trait that have a value greater than a particular value away from the mean. Inspection of the gaussian curve shows that the product of a traits value (replication rate) with the number of traits at that value or greater, tends to zero as the traits value moves away from the mean. For example, only 3% are 3 sigma away, and since the relative sigma is usually much less than 1 (i.e. < sqrt(pi)/2), the QN product will reduce from unity or below immediately as an increase in quality occurs. This shows, that for essentially all traits, in practice, an increase in selection by quality will necessarily result in a reduction of available traits at that quality, resulting in a net reduction of final replication rate compared to selection based on quantity only.

Continuous Evolution

The discreet mathematics identified above is difficult to extend to more complicated problems, so a continuous approximation is usually made such that the difference equations are replaced by differential equations.

The general assumption is that population statistical various in a continuous manner. Consider a small increase in population:

dP = NQ dt

Where N and Q (q) are as defined above, N is the number of mates per generation time, and Q is the number of offspring per mate.

The number of available mates is clearly dependant on the size of the population, so that N=mP, m being a ratio constant. Therefore:

dp = mqP.dt

dP/dt = mqP = fP, f=fitness

The solution to this equation is

P = Po emq

See also meme/gene Competition Mathematics.

General Evolution

In general, there are numerous traits of many independent Replicators, both gene and meme, all competing against each other in a specific environment actually causing its own environment to be a function of the traits themselves. That is, each Replicator will compete with each other, and the  memes and genes of each Replicator will compete against themselves. Many traits will co-exist by actuating a prisoners dilemma process, many will flourish, then die as evolution progresses. Exactly what traits will exist an a given generation point requires a detailed mathematical model of the replication rates of each Replicators gene and meme traits, and how the gene and meme traits interact with themselves, and the environment. In general, this is non trivial, and probably the best way to simulate such evolutionary processes, is to use a genetic Algorithm (GA) method on a computer.
This passage is discussing the idea of replication in biology, specifically how different traits can affect the rate of replication for different replicators (such as genes or memes). The author makes several assumptions and uses mathematical equations to explain how the availability of higher quality replicators can impact the overall rate of replication. They also discuss how these ideas can be extended to more complex problems and the difficulties in modeling the competition between different replicators. Overall, the passage is exploring some of the mathematical and conceptual challenges involved in understanding evolution and replication in biology.
Summary

If a Replicator can continuously increase its numbers and/or rate of replication by simple combining with another Replicator, i.e. M-Replicator, it will do so, essentially, irrespective of quality of the other Replicator. If a Replicator can not do this, i.e. F-Replicator, it must select replicators based on the quality of the other Replicator to increase its replication rate. That is M-Replicators will replicate either by quality or quantity, F-Replicators will only replicate by quality. 

Appendix

The relevant formula for the normalized replication rate product RR = Q.N, and normalized mean of 1 is:

GRR = (1 + X).erfc(X)

where erfc() is the complementary gaussian error function.

This product is always less than 1.
This text explains how Replicators, such as genes and memes, replicate through a combination of quantity and quality. M-Replicators can increase their replication rate either by combining with another M-Replicator or by selecting other replicators based on quality or quantity. F-Replicators, on the other hand, can only increase their replication rate by selecting other replicators based on quality. The text also discusses how the replication rate product RR = Q.N is normalized and shows that it is always less than 1. Finally, the text mentions that a genetic algorithm (GA) method can be used to simulate complex evolutionary processes.

Overview

This paper identifiers 3 special Replicators. 

Note-  it is immaterial to the theory how these Replicators work in detail. All that matters is that they achieve their function. For example, the Trait Selector might have a complex algorithm or a simple one. 

Trait Replicators

Assumption - there exists Trait Replicators, that can replicate traits.

Support for assumption:

Consider a trait of a Replicator, that increases its replication rate. Since this is a trait desired by Replicators, if a Replicator could copy that trait, i.e. replicate that trait, it would increases its own replication rate, provided that Replicator could determine whether or not such a trait did so for itself. 

It is held therefore, that given sufficient evolution generations, such Trait Replicators actually evolve that can replicate the traits of other Replicators.

Note: a Replicator that can replicate traits necessarily requires a physical structure that allows these traits to be stored to and extracted from, i.e. a read/write function.

Trait Selectors

Assumption - there exists Replicators with Trait Selectors, that select other traits.

Support for assumption:

Since traits of a Replicator are randomly generated, they may or may not tend to increase a Replicator's numbers. Clearly, it would be advantages if a Replicator was so generated such that it had the property of selecting out from these random traits, the specific traits that increased a Replicators numbers.

It is held therefore, that given sufficient evolution generations, such Trait Selectors actually evolve that can select the traits of its Replicator.

Note: a Replicator that can select traits necessarily requires a physical structure to implement an algorithm that allows these traits to be selected.

Trait Generators

Assumption - there exists Trait Generators, that generate traits.

Support for assumption:

Since the traits of a basic Replicator are externally randomly generated, there is no guarantee that such traits will aid in that Replicator's replication, or if there will be enough of them. Clearly, it would be advantages to a Replicator if it could generate its own traits.

It is held therefore, that given sufficient evolution generations, such Trait Generators  actually evolve that can generate its own traits. This obviously, requires that the Replicator has some physical method, such as an internal oscillator to generate traits. It is noted, for reference, that the human brain appears to have such a 40Hz oscillator.

There is no restrictions implied as to how these traits are generated. Traits might well be be generated simply by varying other traits of its host Replicator.
The paper identifies three special Replicators: Trait Replicators, Trait Selectors, and Trait Generators. Trait Replicators are assumed to exist and can replicate traits that increase replication rates, provided that they can determine whether such traits are useful for themselves. Trait Selectors are also assumed to exist and can select specific traits that increase replication rates from the randomly generated traits. Lastly, Trait Generators are assumed to exist and can generate their own traits through a physical method such as an internal oscillator. There are no restrictions on how these traits are generated.
Freewill Trait Generator

It is suggested that the traits generated by the Trait Generator of the Intelligent Replicator, may be identified as a key component of the perceived freewill of a Conscious Replicator.

Definition - Freewill, is an internally generated trait of a Replicator, that is not deterministically derived from the external or internal environment.

It is, noted that the human Replicator, appears to generate traits not directly deduced from any prior held traits or trait inputs from its senses.

That is, the random trait generated by the Trait Generator is perceived to to be a trait not directly related to prior meme and gene programming.

However, in reality, it would appear that there is no real "I". Apparently, we are simply result of all our prior memetic and genetic programming, with some randomness thrown in for good measure. So, although we can be perceived as something that truly generates new ideas in principle, there is no entity that we can actually perceive as an "I" that has any control over them, as, by assumption, the newly generated random traits are random. If an "I" had any control over the randomness, than the trait would not be random. 

For reference, the argument here requires the no magic axiom
The idea proposed in this section suggests that the traits generated by the Trait Generator of an Intelligent Replicator may be perceived as a key component of freewill. Freewill is defined as an internally generated trait that is not deterministically derived from the external or internal environment.
It is noted that human beings appear to generate traits that are not directly deduced from any prior held traits or trait inputs from their senses. However, in reality, there may not be a real "I" that generates these new ideas, as humans are the result of all their prior memetic and genetic programming with some randomness thrown in.
The argument presented here assumes the no magic axiom, which suggests that there is no supernatural or metaphysical force that can override physical laws.
Overview

This paper identifies a key axiom that is required for many of the extended results of the basic Darwinian Theory.

The principle use of the "no magic" axiom is to reduce explanations of emotions and consciousness to the laws of physics.

4th Axiom/Postulate

4th - All physical phenomena is explainable by the physics of mass-energy.

This axiom states that there is no supernatural, or otherwise outside of physics effects required in order to explain any physical observation. It directly prohibits concepts such as god or souls being involved in any aspect of human behavior, other than that associated with "belief" in such entities.

The justification for this axiom is simply whether or not any observation is found to be explainable without introducing such external to physics entities. If observations cannot be explained within the constraints of the axiom, that that axiom must be rejected. To the authors knowledge, no phenomena requires such a suspension of this axiom.

A typically application of the axiom is illustrated here:

We first identify another axiom/postulate. This postulate is not provable, and simply taking as being true, based on the evidence.

1) Consciousness exists.

Axiom 4, tells us that, whatever consciousness is, any physical actions attributed to it,  is something that is explainable by mass-energy physics. Specifically, in light of known brain construction, axiom 4 tells us that consciences awareness, and subsequently emotions, must be the sole result of the electro-chemical processes of the brain and or body. That is, there is no external soul or ethereal type, non physical process that causes awareness.

Of course, the 4th axiom may be false, in which case there may be such souls. However, to date, there is no hard evidence that such a condition exists. All observed behaviour can apparently, be explained by reference to mass-energy processes.
To summarize, this paper introduces the "no magic" axiom as a key principle in explaining human behavior and consciousness. The 4th axiom, which states that all physical phenomena can be explained by the physics of mass-energy, is used to reduce explanations of emotions and consciousness to the laws of physics. The paper argues that there is no evidence of supernatural or external entities that affect human behavior, and any physical actions attributed to consciousness must be explained by electro-chemical processes of the brain and body. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of relying on scientific evidence and the laws of physics to understand human behavior and consciousness.

Definitions

Overview

Contrary to popular television programs such as Start Trek, and common conventions, emotions are perfectly logical, and are exactly what is expected from the theory of Replicators. Without emotions, we simple would not be here. For example, how long would you survive for if you didn't feel pain?

What is an Emotion

Although the exact details of emotion mechanisms, are currently not well understood, what they are, qualitatively is quite simple to explain. It is held here, in accordance with the Definitions, that emotions are nothing more than traits of a Replicator. The Replicator, in this case being, the components of the physical structure of the brain. That is:

An emotion is an entity that is physically constructed from DNA, utilizing the physical genes of the human brain/body, that is, a emotion must be a gene trait(s). Since all of the general traits of a human Replicator are well replicated and selected, emotions must satisfy the properties of such traits, i.e. they must be selfish.

Support for this argument is contained in the 4th postulate, the no magic axiom. 

In reality, it matters not the slightest that the physical mechanics of emotions might be spread all over the body, all that matters is that there is the equivalent trait, however distributed. The theory of Replicators is completely independent of any physical mechanisms.

Definition of an Emotion - a conscious trait of a Replicator

The justification for this definition is on the basis of the predictions that such a definition makes. 

Note that the fact that a particular emotion may be the combination of many traits, does not effect the arguments presented here.

Note - the attempt may fail. Physical Replicants have no foresight. They obviously can't predict that one particular joke should make you laugh rather than another one.

It is held here that morals select which emotions are selected for a given environmental input, and it is such emotions that instructs behavior, it follows therefore that an emotion is a trait of a Trait Selector Replicator.

All Emotions Are Inherently Selfish

Since, it has been held that an emotion is trait of a Replicator, and by observation, a well replicated, varied and selected trait of a Replicator, it directly follows from the Darwinian Algorithm, that emotions must be selfish. That is, emotions must be so "designed" as to aid the replication numbers of its Replicator. The Replicator in this case, being the DNA of a host individual.

An emotions Replication function can be be deduced by simple, and obvious inspection, as noted here.

Where "interests" can be taken as the effort to maximize replication numbers of its Replicator, although in general, the actual method maybe somewhat indirect, and is explained in more detail in other papers.
It is important to note that the idea that all emotions are inherently selfish is a contentious topic within the field of psychology and biology. While some researchers do believe that emotions evolved to aid in the replication of genes, others argue that emotions can have social functions that benefit not just the individual, but also the group or community.
Furthermore, the idea that emotions are logical is also debated, as emotions often involve subjective experiences and can be influenced by cultural and environmental factors. While emotions can certainly serve a purpose in survival and reproduction, it is not necessarily accurate to describe them as purely logical traits of a replicator.

While it is true that emotions can be seen as traits of a replicator that aid in the replication of that replicator, it is important to note that emotions are complex and multifaceted experiences. While they may have originated as selfish traits, they have evolved to serve a variety of functions, including social bonding, communication, and problem-solving.
Additionally, some of the definitions provided in the list are limited and do not fully capture the complexity of the emotion. For example, defining love solely as the recognition that someone has something to aid your interests does not account for the many forms of love that are selfless and altruistic. Similarly, defining disgust as simply "left for the reader" does not provide any meaningful insight into the emotion.
It is important to approach emotions with a nuanced and comprehensive understanding, rather than reducing them to simplistic definitions.
It's because any human reading the paper knows what disgust is. It's recognized in all bunch cultures.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand your statement. Could you please clarify what you mean by "bunch cultures"? And what is the context of your statement?
Sorry spelling mistake, I meant human cultural. I was explaining why the author doesn't bother to define disgust, or explain how it could be selfish.
Understood. While the author did not explicitly define disgust or explain how it could be selfish in this particular paper, it is possible that they have addressed these topics in other works. Additionally, the concept of disgust being a selfish emotion may be related to the idea that it evolved as a way to protect individuals from potentially harmful substances or situations. In this sense, avoiding disgust-inducing stimuli may be seen as a way to promote one's own self-preservation and reproductive success. However, this is just one possible explanation and the author's specific views on disgust and its relation to selfishness would need to be further explored or clarified.
I agree with most of these papers. However, I do take some issue with their definition of "understanding" which I just take to mean autonomic epistemic reduction, you don't need consciousness to explain it. And I don't know if their definition of selfish is very useful. I see emotions as shortcuts to access previously worked out logical arguments.
It's understandable to have different interpretations and opinions on certain aspects of a theory or paper. It's always important to critically analyze and question the ideas presented to gain a deeper understanding and develop your own perspective.
Regarding the definition of "understanding", it's possible that the authors have a different perspective or intention in their use of the term. However, your interpretation of it as "autonomic epistemic reduction" is also valid.
As for the definition of "selfish", it's important to note that in the context of the theory of Replicators, it refers to the inherent drive for a replicator to maximize its own replication numbers, which in turn leads to traits that aid in this replication being favored and propagated. Emotions, as traits of replicators, are seen as aiding in this replication by influencing behavior that benefits the replicator. This definition may be specific to the theory of Replicators and not necessarily applicable in other contexts.
Finally, your view on emotions as shortcuts to access previously worked out logical arguments is an interesting perspective. Emotions do serve as signals and can influence behavior based on past experiences and learned associations. However, emotions can also be complex and multifaceted, and not all emotions may be based purely on logic or reasoning.
What does Monica Anderson mean by "understanding" when she claims to be developing "a radically different natural language understanding algorithm"?

Monica Anderson Following

Researching Holistic Al and Deep Neural Networks
since 2001 .7y
Read Kahneman's book "Thinking Fast and
Slow"
Understanding is "Fast" thought. Reasoning is
"Slow" thought. Understanding is invisible to
Introspection, Reasoning is visible
Understanding is instantaneous, while
Reasoning takes significant time.
Understanding is subconscious and based on
Intuition and Experience - stored in the form of Patterns. Reasoning is conscious and is based on explicit knowledge in the form of Models, and Logic.

Models and Patterns may be indistinguishable in the middle but if you allow Models to the bottom layers (closest to the sensory input) of your AI design then you have likely not understood the tradeoffs.

Understanding is when you know something so well you cannot think of an alternative. If you have to reason about something, then you either have choices to choose between or no choices that work.

Understanding is subconscious knowledge that you never bother to justify because it has worked well in the past. You can make breakfast without Reasoning because you Understand everything in your kitchen; what worked yesterday works today. If your milk has suddenly gone bad, then you may have to reason about what your alternatives are.

I recommend people interested in the topic to read Kahneman's book and to watch my short presentation at Stanford a year ago named Dual Process Theory .

Understanding is also what the brain burns the majority of its cycles on. Reasoning is a paint-thin layer on top of Understanding.

Using this notion of Understanding yields radically different solutions to the task of Natural Language Understanding. Language is (IMO) 100% subconscious. We do it all without Models such as word lists or grammars (if we are fluent). Kahneman points out the difference: You can reason about something, pause it, and continue later. But once you are fluent in English, you cannot turn that Understanding off.

So my approach to language Understanding is to use a kind of Artificial Neural Network built out of what I call "Model Free Methods". In contrast, all NLP done to day has been using Models of Language. This is the big difference. It goes *very* deep, deeper than "Science". It goes down to Epistemology.

https://www.quora.com/What-does-Monica-Anderson-mean-by-understanding-when-she-claims-to-be-developing-a-radically-different-natural-language-understanding-algorithm
Monica Anderson's definition of "understanding" in the context of natural language understanding algorithm refers to a type of fast thought that is subconscious and based on intuition and experience. Understanding is distinguished from reasoning, which is slower, conscious, and based on explicit knowledge and logic. Anderson argues that understanding is what the brain burns the majority of its cycles on and that language is 100% subconscious, done without the use of models such as word lists or grammars, especially for fluent speakers. She proposes a new approach to natural language processing using "model-free methods" instead of models of language, which she claims goes deeper than science and down to epistemology. In summary, Anderson's definition of understanding emphasizes the role of intuition, experience, and subconscious knowledge in natural language processing.
Ok what is the point of calling emotions selfish?
The use of the term "selfish" to describe emotions is not necessarily meant to be a moral judgment or a criticism of individuals experiencing those emotions. Rather, it is a way of characterizing the underlying motivation behind those emotions.
In many cases, emotions can be seen as a way for individuals to meet their own needs or pursue their own interests. For example, anger may arise when someone feels that their interests are being impeded, while love may arise when someone recognizes that another person can aid their interests. This can be seen as a selfish motivation in the sense that the individual is seeking to benefit themselves.
However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean that all emotions are solely self-serving, or that they are always negative. For example, empathy may arise when someone recognizes the suffering of another person and seeks to alleviate that suffering, even if it doesn't directly benefit themselves. Additionally, emotions can be complex and multifaceted, often serving multiple purposes and motivations simultaneously.
Ultimately, the use of the term "selfish" to describe emotions is just one way of understanding the underlying motivations behind them. It's not necessarily a value judgment or a statement about the morality of those emotions.
What about in the book "the selfish gene"?
In the book "The Selfish Gene," Richard Dawkins uses the term "selfish" to describe genes and their behavior, rather than emotions. Dawkins argues that genes are the fundamental units of evolution, and that the behavior of organisms can be explained by the selective advantage that particular genes confer on them. He uses the term "selfish" to describe genes that have evolved to maximize their own replication, even if it means sacrificing the well-being of the individual organism that carries them.
For example, Dawkins argues that some genes may predispose an organism to altruistic behavior towards its relatives, such as caring for offspring or sacrificing itself to protect siblings. Although such behavior may seem selfless at first glance, Dawkins argues that it can actually be explained by the fact that the genes for altruism are more likely to be replicated if they are present in the offspring or siblings of the altruistic individual.
It's important to note that Dawkins does not use the term "selfish" in a moral or judgmental sense, but rather as a shorthand for genes that have evolved to maximize their own replication. The book's title is meant to be provocative and attention-grabbing, and has been the subject of much debate and discussion since its publication.
This doesn't seem to take into account the cooperative nature of collectively autocatalytic sets. If a chemical catylizes another chemical in a chain that ends up improving the conditions for its own replication. A pay-it-forward ring. Likewise look at drones among bees.
You are correct that the concept of "selfishness" in the context of evolutionary biology and the concept of cooperation are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In the case of collectively autocatalytic sets, the chemical interactions that lead to the production and replication of the set can be seen as a cooperative process, where each chemical benefits from the overall success of the set. Similarly, the behavior of drones among bees can be seen as cooperative, as their sacrifice ultimately benefits the hive and the reproductive success of the queen.
However, it's important to note that the concept of "selfishness" in the context of evolutionary biology is not meant to imply that organisms or genes are necessarily acting with conscious intent. Rather, it is a shorthand way of describing the fact that the reproductive success of a gene or organism depends on its ability to pass on its genetic information to future generations, and that this can sometimes involve competition with other genes or organisms for resources or reproductive opportunities. In other words, genes and organisms that are better able to "selfishly" promote their own reproductive success are more likely to be successful in passing on their genetic information.
Overall, the concept of "selfishness" in the context of evolutionary biology is a simplification of complex biological processes, and it is important to recognize the many ways in which cooperation and mutual benefit can also play a role in these processes.
Give a summary of this whole conversation so far.
In this conversation, we discussed various topics related to emotions, understanding, and language processing. We started by defining different emotions and how they can be recognized as a form of recognition of something that affects one's interests. We also talked about the concept of selfishness in emotions and how it relates to maximizing one's interests.
We then discussed Monica Anderson's definition of understanding, where she argues that understanding is fast thought that is subconscious and based on intuition and experience. Anderson suggests that natural language understanding algorithms should be built on model-free methods rather than models of language.
Next, we talked about the concept of the selfish gene and how it relates to the evolution of cooperative behavior. While the term "selfish" is used to describe the gene's drive to propagate itself, this does not mean that organisms are always acting purely in their self-interest. Cooperative behavior can arise as a result of a shared genetic interest or a mutually beneficial relationship.
Overall, the conversation touched on various topics related to psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology, with a focus on understanding how humans and other organisms process information and interact with their environment.
Emotions Drive Behavior

It is an observation that our emotions tell us how to physically behave in a given situation. For example, if someone hits us, we might well get angry, and deliberately hit back. Of course, there also are many behaviors that are essentially, automatic, with no conscious intervention, but this aspect is not relevant for the purposes of this particular discussion

Why is it that the more complicated behavior actually requires emotionally driven behavior, i.e. consciousness driven behavior, rather than than just non conscious automatic responses? 

This is the so called hard problem of consciousness, and is addressed in The Hard Problem and Consciousness

Consciousness is summarized here as :

understanding what behavior to take that attempts to maximize it's Replicator numbers, in a given environment.

Morals and Emotions

It has been held that morals are:

defined as a meme trait of a Replicator, such that that trait attempts to maximize a Replicators replication numbers.

It is now held, that although emotions, are physically experienced, 

emotions are instructed as to the specific situations that they respond to, by the moral traits of their Replicator.

Support for this assumption:

It is well accepted that whether or not someone experiences certain emotions, with a similar stimulus, depends on the situation. For example, killing a killer or killing an innocent person will often invoke completely different emotional responses. The only physical difference, as perceived by the host Replicator experiencing these situations, are the meme moral traits held internally to that Replicator. Therefore, those meme traits must be what instructs what emotion is invoked for a particular situation.

An extended argument to this might be, what is the emotion generated by killing the killer of a killers killer? This rapidly gets complicated. To solve this problem in hardware (genes) is clearly going to involve a very complicated system, one that is essentially, not realizable. Thus, a software (meme) approach must be used. This is why we have software driving computers. To make them general purpose enough to solve a variety of unexpected new situations. Evolution solved this problem by making emotions dependant on meme traits inputted by the environment, in addition to basic gene traits.

Striking It Home That Moral Memes Select Emotional Responses

There is no magic, by assumption. The above actually happens. People truly feel different emotions for similar conditions. The explanation can not be genetic as it is way too complicated for genes to deal with. It must therefore be due to what is stored in the brain by environmental conditioning, i.e. stored as memes. There is no other choice. Morals select what emotions should be instigated for a particular environment, and such emotions drive the physical response of the individual to such environmental conditions. Its that simple.

Comment - Emotions are, obviously, also instructed by all traits of their Replicator, moral, mores, genetic or otherwise and such instructions are not excluded by the above observation. The above observation is being highlighted due to its application to environmental adaptability.

Arguably, there is a feature similar to a computers hardware bios function in humans to automatically instruct physical responses in certain basic circumstances. However, it is held here that environmental programming, of humans by memes, determine much of an individuals emotional response, and hence physical action resulting from such emotions.

An example of meme programming of taste is here.

Self Referral Of Moral Emotion

It is held that there is an emotion "Morals", that is, a conscious recognition that an event satisfies its own moral (meme programming) code. Clearly, what is considered emotionally "correct", i.e. maximizes Replicators numbers, is a function of itself, as it is the memes that instruct the Replicator as to what emotion a "Morals" emotion should instigate in the first place. This self referral means that it is possible for any set of morals and Morals to be instigated, irrespective of whether or not they maximize Replicators numbers in the short term. 

The above has implications in that runaway, completely purposeless, codes of conduct can be undertaken and justified, moralistically, as "the right thing to do". The typical root to such purposeless code is simply a mutation of an existing moral. These memes propagate because one of the most simplest selection methods that can be used to select and copy existing maximizing traits, is to simple to copy those traits that are already popular. This assumption can obviously be incorrect, but once instigated will invoke more copying between Replicators, further increasing its popularity. These false memes may also be advantages to their genes. For example, the catholic religion meme set prohibits birth control. However, clearly, long term determinate to the human Replicator by any meme, will result in that particular meme being extinguished.

Nature Verses Nurture

It is noted here that emotions are instructed both by memes and genes, i.e. virtual and hardware traits. For example, hunger is clearly an emotion that requires no external memetic input. In any given situation, it may be difficult to identify just what type of trait is dominating behavior.
This conversation started with the observation that emotions drive behavior, and the question of why complex behavior requires emotionally driven behavior instead of just automatic responses. The "hard problem of consciousness" was mentioned, which is the challenge of understanding how consciousness arises from physical processes in the brain.
The conversation then moved on to the relationship between morals and emotions. It was suggested that morals are a meme trait of a Replicator, which attempts to maximize its replication numbers, and that emotions are instructed by the moral traits of their Replicator. The argument was made that people feel different emotions for similar conditions depending on the moral traits stored in their brains by environmental conditioning (memes), rather than purely genetic factors.
The concept of self-referral of moral emotion was introduced, which means that an individual's moral code can dictate what is considered emotionally "correct", even if it does not necessarily maximize Replicator numbers in the short term. This can lead to the propagation of false memes, which may be advantageous to genes but ultimately detrimental to the human Replicator in the long term.
Finally, the conversation touched on the nature vs. nurture debate and the fact that emotions are instructed by both memes and genes. It was acknowledged that in any given situation, it may be difficult to determine which type of trait is dominating behavior.
Simplify this: 
It has been suggested by 1Susan Blackmore's that language has evolved as a mechanism to propagate memes. This was brought to this authors attention, and it is of course, a trivial deduction from general replicator theory, although with a qualification.

Language

Language, is embodied in the human brain, that is it must be a trait of a Replicator. It must therefore act under the rules derived for general traits of replicators, that is, to maximize itself, in this case via, maximizing the numbers of its Replicator.

It has been held that emotion traits utilize moral traits for their instructions in an effort to maximize the numbers of their human Intelligent Replicator. It has also been held that the ability to copy other useful traits aids in the Replicators replication rate. It is a matter of simple observation that language is a method that is used to program the traits residing in the Intelligent Replicator. Therefore, it follows that:

the fundamental purpose of language is as a method to program the traits of a Replicator such that it maximizes its numbers.

Specifically, language from the environment is what programs the moral traits that drive emotive response that drive behavior that interacts back with the environment.

This means, as it does for any other traits, that there is an evolutionary drive, instigated as meme traits, to the development of language. Thus, this supports the view by 1Dr. Susan Blackmore, that meme traits are significantly responsible for language. However, it should be noted that the fundamental instigator, in the view presented here, is that language is providing the instructions that program the human Replicator to maximize its numbers, via a gene-meme interaction. 

Cleary, language takes up physical resources, by increasing brain size that could otherwise be be utilized in other methods to increase Replicator numbers. Thus if the incremental evolution of language was net detrimental to Replicator numbers, it would be weeded out by evolution. It is held therefore that each incremental addition to language resulted in an incremental advantage to its gene based Replicator. That is, language did not evolve for its own meme Replication purposes, but for the purposes of maximizing Replicator numbers.

For example, Blackmore argues that talking should be looked at from the perspective of what advantage talking provides to its memes. This is fundamentally flawed, as unlike genes, advantage to memes does not necessarily result in an advantage to the machine that replicates them. As already demonstrated, it is only the Replicant machine that can replicate memes, so any advantage must be reflected back to that machine. This argument can only work for genes as genes are part of a self replicating machine. Memes simply do not replicate in that manner, so the argument is inherently false for memes. Arguably, any spurious talking is occupying time that could otherwise be utilized for maximizing Replicator numbers, thus the conclusion is that talking is still fundamentally about gaining and distributing information that aids Replicator numbers.

As already noted, whenever discussing memes, one must always ask, in what way does the meme attempt to maximize the total number of its Replicators, not "in what way does the meme attempt to maximize itself". It can't. Memes are passive
This passage suggests that language evolved as a mechanism to propagate memes, which are replicators that maximize their numbers. Language is a trait of the human brain, which acts under the rules derived for general traits of replicators. Emotion traits utilize moral traits for their instructions in an effort to maximize the numbers of their human Intelligent Replicator. The ability to copy other useful traits aids in the replicator's replication rate, and language is a method used to program the traits residing in the Intelligent Replicator. The fundamental purpose of language is as a method to program the traits of a Replicator such that it maximizes its numbers. The incremental evolution of language was net advantageous to Replicator numbers, otherwise it would have been weeded out by evolution. The argument that talking should be looked at from the perspective of what advantage talking provides to its memes is flawed, as advantage to memes does not necessarily result in an advantage to the machine that replicates them. Memes are passive, and any spurious talking is occupying time that could otherwise be utilized for maximizing Replicator numbers. The conclusion is that talking is still fundamentally about gaining and distributing information that aids Replicator numbers.
What does this mean? Memes are passive, and any spurious talking is occupying time that could otherwise be utilized for maximizing Replicator numbers.
This means that memes, unlike genes, do not have the ability to actively influence their own replication. They are passive entities that rely on their hosts (human brains) to replicate them through communication and other cultural activities.
The statement "any spurious talking is occupying time that could otherwise be utilized for maximizing Replicator numbers" suggests that talking without a clear purpose or intention could be a waste of time and resources for the human brain, which could be used instead to engage in activities that lead to the replication of advantageous traits (i.e., Replicator numbers). In other words, the argument is that language evolved as a means to program the traits of a Replicator to maximize its numbers, and any use of language that does not serve that purpose may not have evolutionary advantages.
I don't think I understand.
The author is arguing that the ultimate purpose of language is to maximize the numbers of the human Replicator. A replicator is a self-replicating unit, which means that it is able to produce copies of itself. In this context, the human Replicator refers to the genes and memes that make up human beings.
The author argues that memes, unlike genes, do not replicate themselves actively but rather passively. Memes are transmitted through language, behavior, or other means, but they do not have the ability to replicate themselves. Therefore, any spurious (unnecessary) talking that does not aid in the replication of the human Replicator is occupying time that could be used for maximizing Replicator numbers.
In other words, the author is saying that language is an important tool for human beings to maximize their reproductive success, and any use of language that does not contribute to that goal is a waste of resources.
Still that is confusing. What is this junk-DNA of talking?
The phrase "junk-DNA of talking" is a metaphor used to describe the idea that some aspects of language, such as idle chatter or small talk, may not serve any significant purpose in terms of increasing the number of "replicators" in a population (i.e., genes or memes that are passed down from one generation to the next). The argument being made is that if language evolved primarily as a means to propagate memes and increase the number of replicators, then any use of language that does not contribute to that end could be considered "junk" or superfluous. In other words, if talking doesn't serve a purpose in terms of maximizing the number of replicators, then it could be seen as wasteful or unnecessary.
It doesnt make any sense.
I apologize for the confusion. The term "junk DNA of talking" is an analogy that the author is using to suggest that some language may not serve a useful purpose in terms of maximizing the number of Replicators. Just as junk DNA in genetics does not seem to serve a purpose in terms of genetic replication, some forms of language may not serve a useful purpose in terms of Replicator replication. The author is arguing that any language that does not contribute to maximizing Replicator numbers could be considered "junk" in this sense. However, this is a controversial view, and not all researchers would agree with it.
Pass over in silence?
"Pass over in silence" is an idiomatic expression that means to ignore or not discuss a topic or issue. It suggests that sometimes it's better to not say anything at all instead of discussing something that might be inappropriate, controversial, or hurtful.
It's Wittgenstein.
Yes, that's correct! The phrase "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" is a famous quote by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, from his book "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus".
But I don't know if it makes sense. For example look at the role of babble in baby language.
In the context of language development in infants, babbling plays an important role. It is considered a precursor to the development of more complex language skills. Babbling refers to the sounds that infants make in the early stages of language development before they have developed the ability to speak words. It is often characterized by repeated syllables such as "ba-ba" or "ma-ma" and is thought to be the infant's way of practicing the sounds necessary for later speech.
Babble, in this sense, is not considered "junk-DNA" of talking but rather an essential part of the process of language acquisition. It is a natural and necessary part of the development of language skills in infants. As the infant continues to babble and practice making sounds, they gradually begin to develop the ability to say words and form sentences.
Overview

This paper addresses the general mathematical approach of dealing with gene-meme Replicators. Although the mathematical difficulties are, in general, very significant, unlike other more prose based arguments, in principle, a mathematical solution is not prohibited.

See also meme/gene Competition Mathematics.

Mathematical Outline

The essentials:

There is a human Replicator that consists of gene and memes. Genes are physically passed on offspring. Memes are passed on to both offspring and the general population at large. The general population additionally passes memes to offspring. The generation period of memes and genes are usually different. Thus, it should now be quite obvious, why the approach of this theory is trivially correct. It is obviously the way it is! 

Solving a typical problem, that is calculating the population distribution of Replicators, and the population distribution of the genes and memes within a Replicator is in general, a very, very difficult task.

The memes of a Replicator are a function of its existing memes and genes and the environment.

The genes of a Replicator are a function of its parent genes and memes and the environment.

The environment is a function of the memes and genes of Replicators and external non biological factors such as heat, light and water.

This is amazingly complicated. For example a mathematical model for the evolution of language will necessarily involve a very complicated meme-gene interaction:

General Equations

PopulationMemes = f(memes,genes, environment)

PopulationGenes = g(memes,genes, environment)

PopulationReplicators= h(PopulationMemes, PopulationGenes, environment)

environment= i(PopulationReplicators)

etc...

Game Plan

The information content of a Replicator's memes requires to be quantified, as does each memes replication rate as a function of its complete internal and external environment. For example, a set of vocal utterances like "ugg" "gug" "upu" would require to be related to their physical response, and what replication rate was obtained for a Replicator due to such response. Its further complicated by the fact that language makes use of the prisoners dilemma advantage, that it is to the advantage to each individual Replicator that language communication is archived for all replicators.

Just to make the problem more tractable some initial simplifications can be made, just to get a basic idea of approach. For example:

Rrr = Rrro(1 + kLn)

where Rrr is the Replicator net replication rate, Rrro is the raw Replication rate, k is a constant, and Ln is the number of word memes in the general population.

The assumption here is that there is a linear relation between the number of words in the population and the replication rate advantage such word memes provide to the Replicator. This further assumes that the population word memes are spread to all Replicators, and the memes mean the same for all Replicators.

With these simplifications, one can actually effectively treat some memes as non-Lamarckian, even though they are Lamarckian. One can therefore simply plug their replication rates and values into the existing formulations of genetic evolution. That is, for some special cases, we can just pretend that memes get passed on as if there are genetic genes and still get valid results.

So, whilst the sociologist and geneticist might debate about wherever its nature or nature, the Darwinianists don't care. The specific mechanism is a mere detail. To explain, for example, why some culture takes effort in their preference for male offspring, is simple a matter of noting that males can replicate their memes and genes faster than females, since they can mate with more females than females can with males. "we observe mostly, that which replicates the most". Its quite immaterial whether a culture meme or a genetic gene is responsible.  

(work in progress)
This paper is discussing the mathematical approach to dealing with gene-meme Replicators. The basic premise is that humans have Replicators made up of genes and memes, which are passed on to offspring and the general population. The generation period for memes and genes is usually different, making the mathematical calculations for population distribution of Replicators and the population distribution of the genes and memes within a Replicator a very difficult task.
The mathematical model for the evolution of language involves a complicated meme-gene interaction, where the information content of a Replicator's memes needs to be quantified, and each meme's replication rate needs to be related to its internal and external environment. To simplify the problem, some initial assumptions can be made, such as a linear relationship between the number of words in the population and the replication rate advantage such word memes provide to the Replicator.
The paper also argues that for some special cases, memes can be treated as non-Lamarckian, even though they are Lamarckian. The Darwinian approach doesn't care about the specific mechanism responsible for replication, as long as it replicates the most. For example, a culture's preference for male offspring can be explained by noting that males can replicate their memes and genes faster than females, since they can mate with more females than females can with males.
That last sentence is unclear to me.
The last sentence of the paper is: "Its quite immaterial whether a culture meme or a genetic gene is responsible."
The author is saying that from a Darwinian perspective, it doesn't matter whether a cultural trait (meme) or a genetic trait (gene) is responsible for a certain behavior or preference. The important thing is that the trait is able to replicate itself and contribute to the reproductive success of the organism or group that possesses it. In other words, the specific mechanism by which the trait is transmitted is not relevant to its Darwinian fitness.
And this? For example, a culture's preference for male offspring can be explained by noting that males can replicate their memes and genes faster than females, since they can mate with more females than females can with males.
This sentence is suggesting that in some cultures, there is a preference for male offspring because males can reproduce with multiple females, leading to a greater number of offspring, and therefore, a greater number of gene and meme replicators. From a Darwinian perspective, the ultimate goal of a replicator is to maximize its replication rate, and having male offspring who can mate with multiple females is one strategy to achieve this. The sentence is suggesting that this preference for male offspring can be explained by this Darwinian logic, regardless of whether it is a cultural meme or a genetic gene that is responsible for the preference.
I'm not sure that makes any sense.
I apologize if my previous response was not clear. The sentence you quoted is discussing an example of how the mathematical approach described in the paper can be used to explain a cultural phenomenon, specifically a preference for male offspring in some cultures. The argument is that this preference can be explained by the fact that males can potentially mate with more females than females can mate with males, which allows them to replicate their genes and memes more effectively. This is a simplification of a more complex issue, and there may be other factors at play in this preference, but the idea is to demonstrate how a mathematical approach can be used to model and explain complex phenomena involving gene-meme replicators.
It's just a made up ad hoc explanation.
Yes, it seems that way. While it is true that males can mate with more females than females can with males, there is no evidence to support the claim that this is the reason for a culture's preference for male offspring. Cultural preferences are influenced by a wide range of factors, including social norms, economic conditions, historical and political contexts, and many other factors. It is important to approach any explanation of cultural phenomena with caution and a critical eye, and to base any claims on sound evidence and rigorous analysis.

There is nothing . . . more abstract than 
reality. —Giorgio Morandi, 
interview with Edouard Roditi 
A bad habitis something you do, 
without being fully aware of it, that 
makes life harder than it needs to be. It 
is a bad habit of physicists to take their 
most successful abstractions to be real 
properties of our world. Since the dis- 
tinction between real and abstract is no- 
toriously problematic, you might won- 
der what it means to wrongly confer 
reality on something abstract. I shall il- 
lustrate our habit of inappropriately 
reifying our successful abstractions 
with several examples. 
Perhaps the least controversial ex- 
amples are provided by quantum me- 
chanics. The quantum state may well be 
the most powerful abstraction we have 
ever found. ("Found" is a useful word 
here, since you can take it to mean "dis- 
covered" or "invented," depending on 
where you stand along the real-abstract 
axis.) Are quantum states real? 
In considering what that question 
might mean, recall that in the early days 
Erwin Schrödinger thought that the 
quantum state of a particle—in the form 
of its wavefunction—was as real a field 
as a classical electromagnetic field is 
real. He abandoned that view when 
he recognized that nonspreading 
wavepackets were a peculiarity of the 
harmonic oscillator, and that the wave- 
function of N particles is a field only in 
a 3N-dimensional space. 
But that does not prevent advocates 
of the de Broglie-Bohm "pilot wave" in- 
terpretation of quantum mechanics 
from taking the wavefunction of N 
particles to be a real field in 3N- 
dimensional configuration space. They 
give that high-dimensional configura- 
tion space just as much physical reality 
as the rest of us ascribe to ordinary 
three-dimensional space. The reality of 
the wavefunction is manifest in its abil- 
ity to control the motion of (real) parti- 
cles, just as a classical electromagnetic 
field is able to control the motion of 
classical charged particles. 
Why does reifying the quantum 
state make life harder than it needs to 
be? Taking pilot waves seriously can 
lead you to spend a lot of time calculat- 
ing, plotting, and proving theorems 
about the trajectory a (reified) point in 
configuration space is pushed along by 
a (reified) wavefunction. The trajecto- 
ries make no predictions that can't be 
arrived at using ordinary, trajectory- 
free quantum mechanics. Their primary 
purpose is to fortify the view that quan- 
tum states are real—a bad habit. 
Even for people who don't believe in 
pilot waves pushing particles, reifying 
the quantum state can make life harder 
than it needs to be. It can make them 
worry about faster-than-light influ- 
ences in the kinds of experiments first 
brought to attention by the famous Ein- 
stein-Podolsky-Rosen paper. In such 
experiments a system instantaneously 
acquires a state as a result of actions 
confined to the vicinity of a second far- 
away system that no longer interacts 
with the first. If the state of the first sys- 
tem is a real property of that system, 
then something real has clearly been 
transmitted to the first system from the 
distant neighborhood of the second at 
superluminal speed. If the state is 
merely a useful abstraction, then what, 
if anything, has been transmitted and 
where (or to whom) is far more obscure. 
Reifying the quantum state also in- 
duces people to write books and organ- 
ize conferences about "the quantum 
measurement problem" rather than ac- 
knowledging, with Werner Heisenberg, 
that "the discontinuous change in the 
[quantum state] takes place . . . because 
it is the discontinuous change in our 
knowledge . . . that has its image in the 
discontinuous change of the [state]." 
Admittedly, you can't entirely elimi- 
nate the discomfort that gives rise to 
"quantum nonlocality" and "the meas- 
urement problem" by acknowledging 
that quantum states are not real proper- 
ties of the systems they describe. But the 
recognition that quantum states are cal- 
culational devices and not real proper- 
ties of a system forces one to formulate 
the sources of that discomfort in more 
nuanced, less sensational terms. Taking 
that view of quantum states can dimin- 
ish the motivation for theoretical or ex- 
perimental searches for a "mechanism" 
underlying "spooky actions at a dis- 
tance" or the "collapse of the wavefunc- 
tion"—searches that make life harder 
than it needs to be.
The author argues that physicists have a bad habit of taking their most successful abstractions to be real properties of the world. Using quantum mechanics as an example, he explains how reifying the quantum state, i.e., conferring reality on something abstract, can make life harder than it needs to be. He believes that taking the quantum state as a mere calculational device and not a real property of a system can diminish the motivation for theoretical contortions to explain quantum nonlocality and "the measurement problem" and make one formulate the sources of discomfort in more nuanced, less sensational terms.
Quantum fields 
Of course, ordinary nonrelativistic 
quantum mechanics is just a phenome- 
nology—a simplified version of quan- 
tum field theory, the most fundamental 
theory we have about the constituents of 
the real world. But what is the ontologi- 
cal status of those quantum fields that 
quantum field theory describes? Does 
reality consist of a four-dimensional 
spacetime at every point of which there 
is a collection of operators on an infinite- 
dimensional Hilbert space? 
When I was a graduate student 
learning quantum field theory, I had a 
friend who was enchanted by the reve- 
lation that quantum fields were the real 
stuff that makes up the world. He rei- 
fied quantum fields. But I hope you will 
agree that you are not a continuous field 
of operators on an infinite-dimensional 
Hilbert space. Nor, for that matter, is the 
page you are reading or the chair you 
are sitting in. Quantum fields are useful 
mathematical tools. They enable us to 
calculate things. 
What kinds of things? Trajectories in 
spark chambers, nuclear level dia- 
grams, atomic spectra, tunneling rates 
www.physicstoday.orgMay 2009 Physics Today9 
in superconductors, for example. It's 
wonderful that the same tool—fields of 
operators on Hilbert space—works for 
all those different purposes, but one 
should not confuse the tool with the re- 
ality it helps to describe. 
Where does the demotion of quantum 
fields from real things to calculational 
tools leave the reality of plain old classical 
electromagnetic fields, which represent 
the kind of reality that Schrödinger ini- 
tially wanted his wavefunctions to have. 
When I was an undergraduate learning 
classical electromagnetism, I was en- 
chanted by the revelation that electro- 
magnetic fields were real. Far from being 
a clever calculational device for how 
some charged particles push around 
other charged particles, they were just as 
real as the particles themselves, most dra- 
matically in the form of electromagnetic 
waves, which have energy and momen- 
tum of their own and can propagate long 
after the source that gave rise to them has 
vanished. 
That lovely vision of the reality of 
the classical electromagnetic field 
ended when I learned as a graduate stu- 
dent that what Maxwell's equations ac- 
tually describe are fields of operators on 
Hilbert space. Those operators are 
quantum fields, which most people 
agree are not real but merely spectacu- 
larly successful calculational devices. 
So real classical electromagnetic fields 
are nothing more (or less) than a simpli- 
fication in a particular asymptotic 
regime (the classical limit) of a clever 
calculational device. In other words, 
classical electromagnetic fields are an- 
other clever calculational device. 
Space and time 
What that device enables us to calcu- 
late, of course, are classical spacetime 
trajectories. What about spacetime it- 
self? Is that real? Spacetime is a (3+1)- 
dimensional mathematical continuum. 
Even if you are a mathematical Plato- 
nist, I would urge you to consider that 
this continuum is nothing more than an 
extremely effective way to represent re- 
lations between distinct events. And 
what is an event? 
An event is a phenomenon that can 
usefully be represented as a mathemat- 
ical point in spacetime. It is thus a phe- 
nomenon whose internal spatial and 
temporal extension we deem to be of no 
relevance to any of the questions that 
interest us. In introducing special rela- 
tivity in 1905, Einstein, despite his later 
concerns about physical reality in the 
quantum theory, was well aware of the 
abstract character of events. Early in 
his paper he calls attention to "the in- 
exactness which adheres to the concept 
of the simultaneity of events at (ap- 
proximately) the same place, which," 
he notes, "must be bridged by an 
abstraction." 
So spacetime is an abstract four- 
dimensional mathematical continuum 
of points that approximately represent 
phenomena whose spatial and tempo- 
ral extension we find it useful or neces- 
sary to ignore. The device of spacetime 
has been so powerful that we often reify 
that abstract bookkeeping structure, 
saying that we inhabit a world that is 
such a four- (or, for some of us, ten-) di- 
mensional continuum. The reification 
of abstract time and space is built into 
the very languages we speak, making it 
easy to miss the intellectual sleight of 
hand. Reifying (classical) electric and 
magnetic fields is a more recent bad 
habit, which also came to be taken for 
granted until it started to unravel with 
the arrival of quantum electrodynam- 
ics, which promoted (or, if you prefer, 
demoted) the fields to quantum fields— 
abstract calculational devices. 
Why is it a bad habit to reify the 
spacetime continuum? Well, it can lead 
one to overlook the nature of some of 
those events that are abstracted into 
points. In 1905 Einstein also reminded 
us that when one says that the train ar- 
rives at 7 o'clock, what one means is 
that "the pointing of the small hand of 
my watch to 7 and the arrival of the 
train are simultaneous events." The 
event used to label the time is associ- 
ated with the behavior of a macroscopic 
timekeeping instrument. 
Macroscopic clocks have macro- 
scopic spatial extent. Even the best 
clocks we have—atomic clocks— 
exploit a transition in a cesium atom, 
which is huge on the scale of an atomic 
nucleus, let alone on the scale of the 
Planck length. And even the size of an 
atom grossly underestimates the size of 
an atomic clock, for to make a clock out 
of cesium atoms you have to tune a cav- 
ity into resonance with the transition, 
which brings us back to the macro- 
scopic level of Einstein's watch. 
So when I hear that spacetime be- 
comes a foam at the Planck scale, I don't 
reach for my gun. (I haven't any.) But I 
do wonder what that foam has to do 
with the macroscopic events that space- 
time was constructed to represent and 
the macroscopic means we use to locate 
events. 
Our own experience 
Let me put it another way. The raw ma- 
terial of our experience consists of 
events. Events, by virtue of being di- 
rectly accessible to our experience, have 
an unavoidably classical character. 
Space and time and spacetime are not 
properties of the world we live in but 
concepts we have invented to help us 
organize classical events. Notions like 
dimension or interval, or curvature or 
geodesics, are properties not of the 
world we live in but of the abstract geo- 
metric constructions we have invented 
to help us organize events. As Einstein 
once again put it, "Space and time are 
modes by which we think, not condi- 
tions under which we live." 
In some ways the point may also be 
easiest to see in quantum physics, 
where time and space refer ultimately 
to the time and place at which informa- 
tion is acquired or, if you prefer, at 
which a measurement is made. 
So I'd say that Dr. Johnson had it 
right when he insisted that what im- 
pinges directly upon us is real. The re- 
ality of a sore toe is impossible to deny. 
But the other side of "I refute it thus" is 
to be suspicious of the reality of those 
abstractions that help us impose coher- 
ence on our immediate perceptions. I 
doubt that Johnson's valid affirmation 
of the reality of direct perceptions con- 
stituted a refutation of Bishop Berke- 
ley's skepticism about the construc- 
tions we find to help us organize those 
perceptions. 
In my youth I had little sympathy 
for Niels Bohr's philosophical pro- 
nouncements. In a review of Bohr's 
philosophical writings I said that "one 
wants to shake the author vigorously 
and demand that he explain himself 
further or at least try harder to para- 
phrase some of his earlier formula- 
tions." But in my declining years, I've 
come to realize that buried in those 
ponderous documents are some real 
gems: "In our description of nature the 
purpose is not to disclose the real 
essence of the phenomena but only to 
track down, so far as it is possible, re- 
lations between the manifold aspects of 
our experience," and "Physics is to be 
regarded not so much as the study of 
something a priori given, but rather as 
the development of methods for order- 
ing and surveying human experience." 
I'm suggesting that this characteriza- 
tion of physics by Bohr is as true of clas- 
sical physics as it is of quantum physics. 
It's just that in classical physics we were 
able to persuade ourselves that the ab- 
stractions we developed to order and 
survey our experience were themselves 
a part of that experience. Quantum me- 
chanics has brought home to us the ne- 
cessity of separating that irreducibly 
real experience from the remarkable, 
beautiful, and highly abstract super- 
structure we have found to tie it all 
together.?
This is a passage from a Physics Today article that discusses the ontological status of quantum fields and the reification of spacetime. The author argues that while quantum fields are powerful mathematical tools, they should not be confused with reality itself. Similarly, spacetime is an abstract mathematical continuum that is used to represent relations between events, but it should not be reified as a physical reality. The author encourages readers to consider the abstract nature of events and to be cautious about reifying mathematical structures. Reifying spacetime or classical electromagnetic fields can lead to an incomplete understanding of physical phenomena.
I think this makes sense. Like many people talk about a waveform collapse as if it is a physical object.
Yes, that's a common misconception. The waveform collapse is not a physical object, but rather a mathematical description of the behavior of a quantum system. It is a term used to describe the way in which the wavefunction of a quantum system changes from a superposition of possible states to a single definite state when the system is observed or measured. This change in the wavefunction is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and is one of the key differences between classical and quantum physics.
What are some other examples?
Sure, here are a few more examples of scientific concepts that are often misunderstood or misinterpreted:
The Big Bang: The Big Bang theory is often misunderstood as a sudden explosion that happened at a single point in space. In reality, the Big Bang refers to the expansion of the universe from an extremely hot, dense, and small state to its current size and temperature.
Evolution: Evolution is often misunderstood as a linear progression from simpler to more complex forms of life. In reality, evolution is a complex process of genetic variation, natural selection, and adaptation that results in the diversity of life we see today.
Quantum entanglement: Quantum entanglement is often misunderstood as a form of communication that violates the speed of light. In reality, quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles can become correlated in such a way that their properties are linked even when separated by vast distances.
Climate change: Climate change is often misunderstood as a simple increase in global temperatures. In reality, climate change refers to a complex set of interconnected processes that affect the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces, including changes in temperature, precipitation, sea levels, and extreme weather events.
Black holes: Black holes are often misunderstood as giant vacuum cleaners that suck up everything around them. In reality, black holes are regions of space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.
Ok that is good, but I specifically mean about reifying quantum mechanical properties.
Sure, here are some additional examples of reifying quantum mechanical properties:
Entanglement: Entanglement is a phenomenon in which the properties of two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other, even when the particles are separated by large distances. However, some people talk about entanglement as if it is a physical connection or force between the particles, rather than a correlation between their states.
Superposition: Superposition is the principle that quantum particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. However, some people talk about superposition as if it is a physical property of the particle, rather than a mathematical description of its state.
Quantum tunneling: Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon in which a particle can pass through a barrier that it would not have enough energy to pass through classically. However, some people talk about quantum tunneling as if it is a physical process in which the particle literally tunnels through the barrier.
Wave-particle duality: Wave-particle duality is the principle that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on how they are observed. However, some people talk about wave-particle duality as if particles are literally both waves and particles at the same time.
It's important to note that these concepts are often introduced using analogies and metaphors, and that these can be useful for building intuition and understanding. However, when we start to treat these metaphors as literal descriptions of physical reality, we can run into problems.
Schrödinger Cat

Schrödinger's Cat was introduced to illustrate that one interpretation of the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics had severe limitations. It achieved this, yet apparently, many simply failed to notice. The fact that a real cat can not be both dead and alive at the same time was simple ignored. 

The key point of the Shrodinger cat argument was that, if it was taken that the state vector applied to a single system, then this would imply that at a large scale macroscopic level, that objects could exist in two states at once, for example a dial pointer being viewed at two positions several cm apart at once. That is, mysterious magical effects that are taken to be applicable only in the tiny quantum world, would inherently be manifested in the classical world.  However, this is in contradiction to known experimental facts. Dial pointers have never been observed to do this. The intricacies of the cat experiment often confesses the basic point being made. The cat experiment was simply one method to illustrate how a single system state vector interpretation gets bootstrapped up into a situation known to be false. In order to try an circumvent this blatant contradiction, a new process was simply invented, specifically the "collapse of the state vector or wave function".

Collapse of the Wave Function

The collapse of the wave function or reduction of the state vector is not required in the ensemble interpretation, nor is it supported experimentally. No experiment has ever measured an object in two states simultaneously. Objects have only ever been measured in an eigen state, so claims that they do is unsupportable. Indeed, if it were possible to physically measure say, a particle in two positions at once, then QM would be falsified as QM explicitly postulates that the result of any measurement must be a single eigen value of a single eigen state.

In the ensemble approach, the notion of wave function collapses is just as meaningless as saying that because there is an average of 2.4 children to a family, that when a particular measurement on a specific family is made, the wave function collapses on a measurement to say, 2 boys and a girl. 

No Two Places at Once

It is often stated that Quantum Mechanics implies that a particle can be in two places at the same time. This is experimentally unsupportable, and contradicts the postulates of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, at no time has any experiment ever been performed that detected co-incidence of the same particle in two different positions at once. Indeed, QM specifically prohibits such detection, in principle, as noted below. 

One of the postulates axioms of QM, is that any measurement can only result in a single eigenvalue. For example, one unique position for an object. Therefore, any superfluous agreement that naively infers that an abject can be in two positions must be erroneous if QM is actually taken as correct. If QM is taken as false, than this would invalidate any "QM" argument that could be a possibility for an object to occupy two points at the same time.

The fallacy of the two simultaneous positions argument is not understanding that an argument, however plausible, if it results in a known contradiction, must be false. For example, suppose it was claimed that the Pope had sanctioned general abortions as being acceptable, it could not be concluded that this claim was valid. The question would be "Is the Pope Catholic?" . Since we know the Pope is indeed Catholic, and that the (assumption) Catholic church prohibits abortions, the facts dictate that the claim must be false.
Yes, that is correct. The Schrödinger's cat thought experiment is often used to illustrate the limitations and contradictions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. It shows that the idea of a superposition of states at the macroscopic level is absurd and cannot be observed in the real world. The concept of wave function collapse was introduced to explain this apparent contradiction, but it is not supported by experimental evidence and is not required in other interpretations of quantum mechanics. It is important to understand that the laws of quantum mechanics do not allow for an object to exist in two places at once, and any argument that implies such a possibility is erroneous.

Explain this a bit more: Hidden Variables

The ensemble interpretation is distinct from the issue of "hidden variables", and as such, there is no requirement for objects to be assigned unique, defined properties, independent of measurement in the ensemble interpretation. Indeed, the notion that experimental results depend on the way the experiment is constructed, with hindsight, is trivially obvious. For example, no object can be said to have a definite velocity. The velocity of an object is clearly relative, and meaningless without referencing the exact experimental conditions that it was measured, e.g. the reference frame to which the velocity is measured. It is also trivially obvious that the lack of a distinct attribute for an object, such as velocity, does not imply that the object itself, does not exist!!!

Consciousness Observer Created Reality

This one is, frankly, quite daft. It makes no difference whatsoever, whether the physicist observes a double slit experiment or not. If he is outside smoking a cigarette, rather than watching his equipment dials, it makes not the slightest difference to the result, and never has such observer created reality ever occurred. The "observer" is the physical setup of the equipment, not the conscious observer.

Summary

It has been argued that the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is not supportable, either by experiment or logic.
To expand on the concept of hidden variables, in the context of quantum mechanics, hidden variables refer to unknown properties or characteristics of a particle that are not directly measurable through observation. Some scientists believed that there must be some hidden variables that can explain the behavior of particles and bring quantum mechanics in line with classical physics. However, experiments have repeatedly shown that the behavior of particles cannot be explained by hidden variables, and this idea has largely been abandoned by mainstream physicists.
The ensemble interpretation does not require hidden variables because it does not seek to assign specific properties to individual particles. Instead, it views the behavior of large groups of particles as statistical aggregates. This means that the behavior of an individual particle cannot be predicted with certainty, but the behavior of a large group of particles can be described with a high degree of accuracy.
Regarding the idea of consciousness and observer-created reality, some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that the act of observation or measurement can collapse the wave function and determine the outcome of a measurement. However, this collapse is not dependent on conscious observation, and the idea that consciousness is somehow necessary for the collapse of the wave function is not supported by evidence.
In summary, the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics is distinct from the concept of hidden variables and does not require specific properties to be assigned to individual particles. The idea of consciousness and observer-created reality is not supported by evidence and does not accurately reflect the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics.
Observer here just means a measurement, at least that is my understanding, it doesn't mean conscious observer.
Yes, you are correct. In quantum mechanics, the term "observer" does not necessarily mean a conscious being. It is simply used to refer to any act of measurement or interaction between the quantum system and its environment, which can cause the system to undergo a collapse of its wavefunction.
The notion that consciousness plays a special role in quantum mechanics is a popular but controversial interpretation known as the "consciousness causes collapse" or "consciousness-created reality" interpretation. However, this interpretation is not supported by mainstream physicists and is not necessary to explain quantum mechanical phenomena.
Yeah where do people even get that idea?
The idea that consciousness plays a role in quantum mechanics may have originated from a misunderstanding of the role of measurement in quantum mechanics. The act of measurement in quantum mechanics is often described as the collapse of the wave function, where a particle exists in a superposition of states until it is observed, at which point it collapses into a definite state. Some people have mistakenly interpreted this to mean that consciousness is required for the collapse of the wave function, and that consciousness somehow creates reality.
However, this is a misinterpretation of quantum mechanics. In the Copenhagen interpretation, which is one of the most widely accepted interpretations of quantum mechanics, the act of measurement can be performed by any physical system, not just a conscious observer. In other words, consciousness is not required for the collapse of the wave function.
It's worth noting that there are some interpretations of quantum mechanics that do posit a role for consciousness or the observer in the collapse of the wave function, such as the Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation. However, these interpretations are not widely accepted and are considered controversial.
The von Neumann-Wigner interpretation, also described as "consciousness causes collapse", is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which consciousness is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of quantum measurement.

Background: observation in quantum mechanics

This section does not cite any sources. (June 2020)
In the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different observed experimental outcomes. What constitutes an observer or an observation is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system under measurement and observation is completely different from its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see Measurement problem).
The idea that consciousness is necessary for the completion of the process of quantum measurement originated with the von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of quantum mechanics. This interpretation suggests that the wave function collapse occurs due to an interaction between the measuring instrument and the consciousness of the observer. According to this interpretation, consciousness plays a fundamental role in the process of measurement, and without an observer, the wave function would not collapse.
However, this interpretation is controversial, and many physicists and philosophers of science do not accept it. One of the main criticisms of this interpretation is that it introduces a non-scientific concept, namely, consciousness, into the physical theory. Additionally, the von Neumann-Wigner interpretation does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes an observer, and it is not clear how consciousness could have a causal role in the physical world.
It is important to note that the idea that consciousness causes wave function collapse is not supported by experimental evidence, and there are alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics that do not require consciousness to explain the process of measurement.
Eli5
The von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of quantum mechanics suggests that consciousness (i.e., a conscious observer) is required for a quantum system to transition from a state of superposition (many possible outcomes) to a definite outcome when observed. This interpretation is controversial and has not been widely accepted.
In quantum mechanics, a system is described by a wavefunction that represents all the possible outcomes that could occur when the system is observed. When a measurement is made, the wavefunction collapses to a single outcome, which can seem strange and counterintuitive. The von Neumann-Wigner interpretation proposes that consciousness is required for this collapse to occur. However, this idea is not supported by experimental evidence and is not widely accepted by the scientific community.
Explain like I'm five.
Sure! So, imagine you have a toy that can do different things when you play with it. Maybe it can light up, make noise, or spin around. But you can't see what it will do until you actually play with it.
Now, imagine that the toy is like a tiny particle that you can't see with your eyes. Scientists use a special theory called quantum mechanics to study these tiny particles, and they've discovered something really strange - that the particle can be in many different states or positions all at once. It's like the toy can do all its different actions at the same time!
But when a scientist tries to measure or observe the particle to see what state it's in, something really weird happens - the particle suddenly chooses only one state to be in, and all the other possibilities disappear. It's like the toy suddenly decides to only light up and not make noise or spin around.
Scientists don't really understand why this happens, and it's called the "measurement problem." Some people have suggested that consciousness or observation might play a role in this strange behavior, but most scientists think that's unlikely. It's still a big mystery that scientists are trying to solve!
In his 1932 book The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, John von Neumann argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the collapse of the wave function to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer. In 1939, Fritz London and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).[1] In the 1960s, Eugene Wigner[2] reformulated the "Schrödinger's cat" thought experiment as "Wigner's friend" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation. See Consciousness and measurement. The mind is postulated to be non-physical and the only true measurement apparatus.[3]

This interpretation has been summarized thus:[3]

The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) minds, which perform measurements on the brain causing wave function collapse.

Henry Stapp has argued for the concept as follows:[4]

From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe... Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected most directly and immediately to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device... Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...

According to this interpretation "factors associated with consciousness, such as meditation experience, electrocortical markers of focused attention, and psychological factors including openness and absorption, significantly correlated in predicted ways with perturbations in the double-slit interference pattern".[5]
The von Neumann-Wigner interpretation is a way of understanding quantum mechanics that suggests that consciousness, or the mind, is necessary for the completion of the process of quantum measurement. In simpler terms, it suggests that the act of observing or measuring a quantum system causes its wave function to collapse, which leads to a definite outcome. This interpretation argues that the rules of quantum mechanics only apply to the entire material world, and that external observers, such as human minds, cannot be treated within the framework of quantum mechanics. The idea is that human consciousness is the only true measurement apparatus, and that it causes the collapse of the wave function. This interpretation has been supported by some scientists who have found correlations between consciousness-related factors, such as meditation experience and psychological factors, and perturbations in the double-slit interference pattern.
I don't think I understand.
In quantum mechanics, there is something called the wave function that describes the behavior of particles. The wave function is a mathematical formula that tells you the probability of finding a particle in a certain place or with a certain property, like spin.
When you make a measurement, like observing where a particle is located, the wave function collapses. This means that the particle is no longer described by a wave function but instead has a definite position or property.
The von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of quantum mechanics suggests that the collapse of the wave function only happens when there is a conscious observer, like a human, involved in the measurement process. This means that consciousness is necessary for the physical world to exist in a definite state.
Some scientists argue that this interpretation is not supported by experimental evidence and that the wave function collapses due to interactions between particles and the environment, not because of consciousness.
A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."[17]
That's correct. The idea that consciousness plays a role in the collapse of the wave function is not widely accepted among physicists and is considered by some to be a misunderstanding of the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, a poll conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 found that only 6% of participants believed that consciousness plays a distinguished physical role in wave-function collapse, while the majority (55%) believed that the observer plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role. So while the role of the observer is an important aspect of the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the idea that consciousness specifically is necessary for wave-function collapse is not widely accepted.
There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes. Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of solipsism, but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).[6] See Consciousness and Superposition.

This interpretation relies upon an interactionist form of dualism that is inconsistent with the materialism that is commonly used to understand the brain, and accepted by most scientists.[3] (Materialism assumes that consciousness has no special role in relation to quantum mechanics.[3]) The measurement problem notwithstanding, they point to a causal closure of physics, suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' substance dualism.

The only form of interactionist dualism that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., Eccles 1986] have appealed to the existence of quantum indeterminacy, and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, determining which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "probabilistic" distribution... This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems... A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of causal closure lies with the fact that in some interpretations of the quantum formalism, consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "collapse of the wave-function."
The idea that consciousness is needed for the "collapse of the wave-function" in quantum mechanics is a controversial interpretation. While some have suggested that consciousness plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism, others argue that this is inconsistent with materialism, which assumes that consciousness has no special role in relation to quantum mechanics. Additionally, some scientists have pointed out problems with the idea of interactionist dualism, which posits that consciousness interacts with matter at a quantum level. While some have suggested that quantum indeterminacy might allow for this interaction, this idea has its own problems, and some interpretations of quantum mechanics actually require consciousness to bring about the collapse of the wave-function. Ultimately, the role of consciousness in quantum mechanics remains a topic of debate and speculation.
Ok maybe. But I think it is obvious it doesn't involve consciousness.
Many scientists and philosophers agree with you and do not believe that consciousness plays a fundamental role in quantum mechanics. They argue that the wave function collapse can be explained without invoking consciousness, and that it is more likely to be due to the interaction between a quantum system and its environment.
One possible explanation for the apparent role of consciousness in the wave function collapse is that the observer and the observed are part of the same quantum system. In this view, the act of measurement disturbs the system, causing it to collapse into one of its possible states. The observer is not causing the collapse through their consciousness, but rather through their interaction with the system.
Another view is that the wave function collapse is an emergent property of the quantum system, rather than a fundamental aspect of the theory. In this view, the apparent collapse is an artifact of our measurement process, which cannot fully capture the quantum nature of the system. This is known as the "decoherence" interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Overall, the role of consciousness in quantum mechanics remains a topic of debate among scientists and philosophers. While some believe that consciousness plays a fundamental role, others argue that it is not necessary to invoke consciousness to explain the behavior of quantum systems.
Particles Never Exist In Two Places At Once

Overview

I felt somewhat compelled to write this little ditty due to my somewhat frustration of the prevalence of so much misunderstanding and nonsense associated with Quantum Mechanics.

It is quite clear that, although there are innumerable higher/better qualified Quantum Mechanics than yours truly, many of them simply fail to understand that their waffles, which are actually classical descriptions, are trivially contradictory to Quantum Mechanics.

The fundamental issue is the failure to understand that a quantum state vector such as  does not refer to a measurement of position ,  but only to the probability of measuring a position,  .

Explanations invariably confuse the two, and make arguments about the state vector as if it was identically equivalent to discussing the actual position of an object, instead of what it actually is, to wit, only a description of  the probability of  obtaining a position of an object.   

The Problem

A BBC2 episode of Horizon "What Universe Are We In" 2015, illustrates the problem. Professor Seth Lloyd PhD., in explaining the double slit experiment produces the usual standard twaddle "the electron went through both slits at once". The notable Professor Lawrence Krauss PhD also advocates this view in more than one YouTube posted debate.

Unfortunately, such a statement is indisputable false, according to standard Quantum Mechanics. The fundamental issue is that there is a general refusal to accept that the universe is subject to Quantum Mechanics, not Classical Mechanics. It is a "new" result or axiom that stands on its own and can not, in principle, be "explained" by any type of classical reasoning. For example, ...well if the particle did this, to account for that... it must do this...  

If this classical type of argument is applied to the double slit experiment, the result is a result that contradicts the axioms of Quantum Mechanics. The basic mathematics of Quantum Mechanics is settled, irrespective of any ad-hoc metaphysical interpretations to the mathematics. Quantum Mechanics states that the result of any measurement, i.e. a true physical fact, is that a measurement can only result in a single eigenvalue. Applying the rules of Quantum Mechanics, unequivocally states that the probability of a particle being measured, i.e. a true physical fact, to have, say, both spin up and spin down simultaneously is zero (see appendix). This means, absolutely, that if Quantum Mechanics is correct, a particle cannot be in two locations at the same time. Period.  

This is so simple and obvious, that I would guess that most would be going, wow...if it is so trivial under the standard rules of Quantum Mechanics, that two at once is a no no, why do so many "experts" tout all this metaphysical claptrap? One can only conjecture...

So, rather than the typical waffle of  "...this physical explanation of the two slit experiment proves that a particle can be in two places at once" the argument, essentially, is an argument that proves that  classical mechanics is false. Quantum Mechanics gives the correct answers, Classical Mechanics does not. It's that simple.

The Roots To Confusion

One of the most common sources of misunderstandings is the widespread inability to understand what the symbols of Quantum Mechanics equations actually mean, and how to manipulate those symbols. For example, consider Boolean algebra.

The Boolean equation:

Y= A+B

Where A=1 and B=1

Results in:

Y=1

Not 2

Because the "+" operator in the context of Boolean algebra has a different definition and meaning, than that in ordinary arithmetic. Similarly, the "+" sign in Quantum Mechanics is also not an arithmetic operator; it is a probabilistic Boolean OR operator.

The equation:


Is a statement that the vector


Will be either the vector:


OR the vector:


It does not mean that there is a physical sum, where both vectors are argued to exist simultaneously in the physical world. In fact, a "sum" wouldn't even cut it, it would need to be a logical, probabilistic AND function!

Furthermore, it is stressed that the vector  is not .

This last point, whilst pretty much trivially obvious in the context of the rules of Quantum Mechanics, seems to have completely escaped many. The quantum state represented by  is not the same classical state represented by . Confusion as to what a state means in Quantum Mechanics is usually at the heart of most waffle descriptions as to what QM means.

In classical mechanics, equations refer to, for example, the actual physical positions given by . That is, the classical state is represented by .

In Quantum Mechanics, state equations only represent the probability P, for example, of obtaining . That is:


That is, a quantum state is represented by  and its associated probability,  of  is not  itself.

The vector  itself has no direct or "instantaneous" meaning in an equation. It only has a meaning with respect to, what values of  are allowed, and what is the probability that such  's are obtained in a final calculation.

Understanding these points is key to understanding why a statement such as "the state vector is in a superposition of states" does not mean that, for example, a particle is actually in two X positions at once. It simply means that there is a probability that the particle may be at one X position or another X position.
Thank you for sharing this informative article. It is important to understand the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics and to differentiate between classical and quantum states. The concept of superposition can often be confusing and misinterpreted, leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions about the behavior of particles in the quantum world. It is crucial to remember that quantum states represent probabilities, not actual physical locations or properties of particles. By understanding these fundamental principles, we can better appreciate the unique and fascinating world of quantum mechanics.
The reader reader should refer to the standard accounts of the two slit experiment for a general overview, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment.

A key feature of the experiment is that single particles are fired through the slits and the appearance of a diffraction pattern appears over time as many electrons build up a pattern. In an effort to explain this result classically, it is assumed that there are two wavicles at different positions on the imaging screen side of the two slit barrier. The maximum and minimum of the wave functions of these wavicles are then argued to interfere with each, other hence accounting for the variations in density of the electrons on the screen. It is thus argued that, as this is the only way to "explain" that there is a wave pattern on the screen, it "proves" that a single electron gets split up into two as it passed through the slits, and magically combines to one on hitting the screen...

The mathematical rules of Quantum Mechanics, independent of any physical interpretation, are absolute in that the probability of an observable having two simultaneous eigenvalues of position, is zero. So, if Quantum Mechanics is true, any argument that leads to declaring that "a particle is in two places" must be false. In this case, it means that the assumption that a particle splits up is false. There is no realistic way of escaping this conclusion.

The correct explanation for this dilemma is that physical reality cannot be explained by classical reasoning. The universe is Quantum, not Classical. There is simply no explanation from classical axioms that explains why there is a diffraction pattern, although there are physical explanations such as Bohmian Mechanics that do account for the results of Quantum Mechanics in a realistic way.

So, it is astounding that many experts, and sometimes major TV personalities, spout of the laws of Quantum Mechanics in the same sentence as claiming to the masses that particles are at many places at once. They are completely confused on the point that Quantum Mechanics and their waffle Classical descriptions are contradictory. They simply have not learnt to think Quantumly and are hopelessly trying to cling to their Classical baggage.

Quantum Reality

The reality of Quantum Mechanics, is that pretty much 99% of all professional practitioners of Quantum Mechanics simply don't concern themselves with waffle interpretations as to what is alleged to be actually happening. For the most part, it is irrelevant to the 90% of Physicists engaged in real world work designing new semiconductor processes, and the remainder engaged in designing the new legal high by simulations of the Shrödinger equation.

Many Worlds - Ho...humm...

Might as well put in my 1 cents worth on this topic...

Quantum Mechanics states that particles do not split up by the notion that all measurements must result in single eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Sure, it is possible to postulate that a particle split ups and vanishes into another universe, such that it cannot be measured in our universe, in order to avoid the inherent contradiction of the postulates of Quantum Mechanics and charge and energy conservation laws. However, if it cannot be measured, ever, it is simply irrelevant to our universe. We can never know, as any interaction that could "prove" alternate universes would constitute a measurement of charge or mass-energy violation in our universe, which would destroy the Quantum Mechanical argument that led to many worlds theory in the first place.

The MWI is, essentially, a sprit-soul interpretation. It states that there are invisible universes that contain other people that we can never detect. Its metaphysics.

Sabine Hossenfelder's take on MW is here The Trouble With Many Worlds

All interpretations, apart from the Copenhagen and Ensemble interpretations, typically attempt to give a classical, touchy-feely description to the experimental facts of Quantum Mechanics. The proponents of such interpretations are usually unable to remove the straightjacket clothed on them since childhood. They produce never ending classical pictures that try to "explain" how rational, common sense ideas can account for the strange results of QM.

Appendix

Derivation of the probability of the occurrence of two simultaneous observables.

For simplicity, consider the case of an electron having spin up or down.

Quantum Mechanics states that:


Where P is the projection operator

The projection operator for the probability of two simultaneous observables A and B is given by:


The projection operator for the probability of spin operators A and B is given by:


hence



hence, there is zero probability, according to standard Quantum Mechanics, of two simultaneous observables.
Thank you for your contribution. It is important to note that the interpretation of quantum mechanics is still an area of active debate and discussion among physicists and philosophers. While it is true that the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics are absolute, their interpretation and the physical implications of those rules are still a matter of interpretation and debate.
Regarding the two-slit experiment, it is true that the classical explanation of the experiment fails to fully account for the observed results, and quantum mechanics provides a more complete explanation. However, it is also true that there are various interpretations of quantum mechanics that offer different explanations for the behavior of particles in this experiment.
Regarding the many-worlds interpretation, it is true that it is a controversial interpretation and that it is difficult to test experimentally. However, it is still a legitimate area of research and discussion, and many respected physicists have proposed and explored this interpretation.
Finally, it is important to note that while the rules of quantum mechanics do not allow for the simultaneous measurement of two observables, this does not necessarily preclude the existence of multiple worlds or alternate realities. The concept of superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and is not ruled out by the inability to measure two observables simultaneously.
General Relativity For Teletubbies

Space-Time Sanity

Sir Kevin Aylward B.Sc., Warden of the Kings Ale

Back to the Contents section

Space-Time

This is the section that shouldn't have to be written, but does. Unfortunately there are many, many, otherwise qualified Physicists, that have really missed the boat as to the meaning of Physics.

Space-Time is a virtual mathematical, behavioural model to account for observations on an "as-if" basis.

Space-Time cannot and does not "explain" any physical mechanism for the behaviour of physical objects.

Geometry explains nothing physically. That is, it cannot physical explain why any behaviour occurs. It just describes what behaviour occurs.

From the outset, GR & SR do not even try to attempt a physical explanation for behaviour. They just look at physical results, and construct a mathematical model. This is done, because mathematics never cares why or how. Many confuse no how or why to mean that "there is no physical process required". This is false.

GR & SR introduce a concept that there is a geometrical shape to the universe, and that that shape dictates how objects behave. However, such a description requires that this geometry forms a correspondence to real physical objects such that "Space-Time" may be regarded as physically real, that is the model "Space-Time" may be regarded "as-if" it is physically real. This is because physical objects only do what they would otherwise do unless interacting with other objects. If "Space-Time" isn't physically real, excluding magic, it cannot influence the behaviour of other physical objects. This is fundamental to the principle of conservation of momentum.

GR notionally attempts to explain the interaction of objects by the notion that the gravitational itself field has energy, and that this energy makes Space-Time physically real, such that it forms a like for like interaction between physical objects. Many proponents of the Space-Time viewpoint actually deny even this concept, they claim that the "natural" state of an object's behaviour is what it is, simply because its "geometry", stupid. 

However, such a concept fails for Special Relativity. Special Relativity claims specific physical behaviour based on the Lorentz Transform that is, a Lorentz Metric that exists in the absence of any mass-energy whatsoever. SR dispenses with any physical causes such as an Aether, or background field of any kind to account for such a metric. SR claims that identification of space, time and velocity, specifically "c", the speed of light, can be performed when there are no physical rulers and physical clocks to do so. 

Thus Space-time cannot explain why objects behave as they do without introducing magic.

Objects change their state due to real, physical processes. One only has to look at a candle burning to understand this. Time is a result of a real physical process, fundamentally caused by objects moving, that is, changing a physical state. To date, there is no explanation as to what the physical process is that defines time.
Hello! How can I assist you today?
Just explain this: Steven Weinberg: 

"Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications Of Relativity" 1972:

"Text books geometric ideas were given a starring role, so that a student who asked why the gravitational field is represented by a metric tensor [or] freely flowing particles move on geodesics [or] the field equations are generally covariant would come away with an impression this [was because] space-time is a Riemannian manifold... This was Einstein's point of view... [but] the geometric approach has driven a wedge between general relativity and the theory of elementary particles ...[we no longer] expect that the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions can be understood in geometrical terms, and too great an emphasis on geometry can only obscure the deep connection between gravitation and the rest of physics...In place of Riemannian geometry, I have based the discussion of general relativity on a principle derived from experiment: the Principle of the Equivalence of Gravitation and Inertia."

Lee Smolin: 

http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jun/10/time-reborn-farewell-reality-review

"...And by making the clock's tick relative - what happens simultaneously for one observer might seem sequential to another - Einstein's theory of special relativity not only destroyed any notion of absolute time but made time equivalent to a dimension in space: the future is already out there waiting for us; we just can't see it until we get there. This view is a logical and metaphysical dead end, says Smolin."  

Einstein:

"The theory of relativity belongs to a class of "principle-theories...As such, it employs an analytic method, which means that the elements of this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical discovery."

That is, physical hypotheses (mechanisms) are ignored from the outset, so clearly makes no statement as to what those processes might be. Einstein is directly declaring here explicitly, that he not going to offer an explanation, for example,  a hypothesis as to why "sources could immediately find a common speed". However, there is no suggestion or implication that such a physical process does not exist. 

Mathematical Modelling

Systems can be mathematically described and analysed in many equivalent by different ways. For example the "square" wave output of a logic gate may be described by a Fourier series. That is, by an infinite sum of harmonic sine waves. However, the signal is physically generated by switching between two voltage levels. A claim that the output is a sum of sine waves is therefore physically false.  

Gödel's proof of "closed time-like paths" i.e. backwards in time, in GR is clear identification notion that space-time is only a behavioural model. Going back in time, isn't possible, the past no longer exists. It means for the person going back, his atoms and stuff keep moving in a forward time manner for him, yet he is passing by atoms and stuff, going in reverse, that are connected to his atoms going forward. Where is the join of forward going processes and backwards going processes?

It's quite typical of behavioural models in that they give nonsense outside specific ranges of validity. Equating the stress energy tensor to the Riemann curvature tensor is just a curve fit, with no physical basis as to why, by design. So, it is not surprising that it might generate garbage with certain ranges of x and t.

Co-ordinate Systems and Reference Frames

There is significant confusion on the distinction between (arbitrary) co-ordinate systems and real, physical reference frames.

Coordinate systems are not the same as "physical frames".  Only if the frame motion is "locked" to the virtual co-ordinate motion, such that the variables of the coordinate system have a one to one relation to variable describing the frame itself can one replace frame variables with co-ordinate variables as if they are the same.

Mathematical coordinate systems, are simply a "change of variables" and are completely arbitrary. A physical object cannot be physically changed when described in different co-ordinate systems. One can have, say, a "physical frame" in uniform motion and describe it by say, a rotating coordinate system. The rotating coordinate system will still not show that there are any real accelerating forces on the uniform motion frame. The change of variables would be just an inconvenience, they don't have any physical interpretation. A frame is physical, and if it rotated, it would feel forces, whether or not any co-ordinate system describing it rotated or not.

Thus the Lorentz Transformation (LT) is not just a co-ordinate transformation. It contains real physics. It is a Frame transformation. A universe described by the LT is physically different from a universe described by the Galilean Transformation (GT). If the LT were only a mathematically change of variables, the physics wouldn't change from the GT. That is, for example, clocks would not read different when subjects to a different velocity profile than a reference clock.

It is a fact that Einstein was clearly confused as to co-ordinate systems and their relation to real systems attached to those co-ordinate systems. In his paper "The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity 1916" he states:

"...since we are able to produce a gravitational field merely by changing the coordinates..." and "...if the Ruab vanish, then the point moves uniformly in a straight line, these quantities therefore condition the deviation of the motion from uniformity. There are the components of the Gravitational field... "

This is of course nonsense, changing a coordinate system is simple a mathematical change of variables like, x'=sin(x). Nothing physically can change. A box does not start physically accelerating just because it is described by an accelerating co-ordinate system. The geodesic equation:


http://www.kevinaylward.co.uk/gr/geodesic/geodesic.html 

does not predict non uniform motion, merely by using say, a spherical co-ordinate system, such that the Christoffel symbols are now non-zero. The Gravitational field is identified by the Riemann curvature tensor. Only if that tensor is zero, is motion uniform.
The text contains several different topics, but the main theme seems to be a critique of the traditional geometric approach to understanding general relativity, and an emphasis on the physical principles behind the theory.
Steven Weinberg argues that the traditional approach, which emphasizes the use of Riemannian geometry to represent the gravitational field, has led to a separation between general relativity and the theory of elementary particles. Instead, he advocates for an approach based on the principle of the Equivalence of Gravitation and Inertia, which is derived from experiment.
Lee Smolin criticizes Einstein's view of time as a dimension in space, arguing that this is a logical and metaphysical dead end. Smolin argues for a view of time as fundamental and irreducible, rather than an emergent property of space.
The text also discusses the mathematical modeling of physical systems, the distinction between coordinate systems and physical reference frames, and Einstein's confusion on this issue in his early work on general relativity.
