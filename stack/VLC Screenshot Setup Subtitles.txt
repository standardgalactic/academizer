Dijiste:
I am wondering if you can remind me how to set up vlc to record screenshots which include the subtitles, there are are proximately 1200 subtitles over 1 hour 40 minutes so I need a frame rate two or three times faster than that to make sure I can capture them all.
ChatGPT dijo:
Absolutely, I can help you set that up in VLC so that it captures screenshots (with subtitles) automatically. Since you're trying to capture all subtitles and want to make sure you don't miss any, capturing at 1���2 frames per second (fps) should be a good starting point.
Here���s how to set up VLC to automatically take screenshots with subtitles included:
���� VLC Screenshot with Subtitles Setup
Step 1: Enable Subtitle Display
Make sure subtitles are turned
on and visible
in VLC:
Open your video.
Go to
Subtitle > Sub Track
and make sure the correct subtitle track is selected.
Step 2: Set the Screenshot Directory and Format
Go to
Tools > Preferences
(or
Ctrl+P
).
In the bottom-left, set
Show settings
to
All
.
In the left pane, go to:
Video > Filters > Scene Filter
.
Set:
Image format
: png or jpg (png is better quality).
Directory path prefix
: where you want to save screenshots (e.g.,
C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\vlc_screenshots
).
Recording ratio
: this is the tricky part. See notes below!
Filename prefix
: optional, like
sub_shot_
.
Step 3: Enable Scene Filter
Still in
Preferences
, go to
Video > Filters
.
Check the box next to
Scene video filter
.
Step 4: Activate the Filter
Now go back to the
main Preferences window
and:
Navigate to
Input / Codecs > Demuxers > Demux module
, and leave it on
Automatic
unless you���re doing something special.
Step 5: Save and Restart VLC
���� How to Set the Right Frame Capture Frequency
VLC uses a ���
recording ratio
��� for scene snapshots ��� it takes
1 frame every N video frames
.
So you need to estimate the
video's frame rate
(FPS). Let's say:
Your video is 25 fps (common for PAL, DVD, etc).
You want
2 screenshots per second
��� So 25 / 2 =
12.5
.
So set
Recording ratio = 12
to get about 2 screenshots/sec.
����
Formula:
Recording ratio = (Video FPS) / (Desired screenshots per second)
������ If you're unsure of the video frame rate:
Open the video in VLC.
Go to
Tools > Codec Information > Statistics tab
and check
Input/Read FPS
.
��� Final Step: Run the Video
Load the video.
Play it through once (or speed it up if you're just capturing).
The screenshots will be saved to the folder you set, with subtitles included in the images.
���� Don���t Forget!
After you���re done:
Disable the Scene video filter
or VLC will continue capturing screenshots for everything.
Let me know if you���d like a batch script or tool to extract just the frames that contain
changes in subtitles
��� might help cut down the 100k screenshots you���ll otherwise get ����
Dijiste:
so it still doesn't look like it exports the subtitles in the screenshots do i have to put them in the demuxer manually?
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, yes ���
VLC won���t burn subtitles into screenshots by default
, especially if they're
external subtitle files
(like
.srt
). Here's how to
force VLC to render (burn) subtitles into the video output
, so they appear in screenshots:
��� Here's the complete process to make sure
subtitles appear in screenshots
:
���� 1.
Burn the subtitles into the video
This is required because VLC's screenshot function only captures the
video output
, and subtitles aren't rendered to the output unless you tell VLC to
overlay them
.
Option A:
Embed subtitles temporarily (no re-encoding)
This works
only for playback
, and your screenshots will include the subs:
Make sure subtitles are enabled
:
Go to
Subtitle > Sub Track > Select your subtitle
.
Now here's the catch: VLC only renders subtitles into screenshots when using
Direct3D or OpenGL output modules
.
������� Check your Video Output Module:
Go to
Tools > Preferences > Video
.
Set
Output
to:
Direct3D11 video output
(on Windows)
Or
OpenGL
(on macOS/Linux)
Save and
restart VLC
.
Now when you take a screenshot (manually or using the scene filter), subtitles should appear.
������ Option B (Guaranteed):
Transcode the video with burned-in subs
If you're still having issues, the most reliable way is to create a temporary version of the video with subtitles hardcoded (burned in). VLC can do this too:
Steps to burn subtitles into a new file:
Media > Convert/Save
.
Add your video and click
Convert/Save
.
In the
Profile
, pick a format like
Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)
.
Click the
wrench icon
(Edit Selected Profile):
Go to
Subtitles
tab.
Check
"Subtitles"
and
"Overlay subtitles on the video"
.
Save and start the process.
Once you���ve created the new video, VLC will naturally include the subtitles in all screenshots.
���� Want to test it quickly?
Play your video with subtitles visible.
Hit
Shift + S
to manually take a screenshot.
Check if the subtitles appear in the image.
If not, it's definitely an
output module issue
, or the subs aren���t being rendered (external vs. internal subtitles).
Let me know what system you're on (Windows, macOS, Linux) and whether you're using
external subs
(
.srt
,
.ass
) or embedded ones ��� I can tailor a faster fix for that too.

How can I fix this? 
Mechachleopteryx@Memex MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/quadrivium (main)
$ git pull --force
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        README.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:

This error means Git is protecting you from
accidentally losing local changes or untracked files
during a pull ��� which could happen if those files get overwritten by what's coming from the remote.
Here���s a breakdown of your situation and how to fix it based on what you want to do:
���� Options: Choose What You Want to Do
��� Option 1:
Keep your local changes (stash them)
If you want to
temporarily save your local changes
, do this:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git stash push --include-untracked
git pull
git stash pop
--include-untracked
ensures those new files (like
omniology/...
) are also saved.
After the pull,
stash pop
will reapply your changes.
���� If there are conflicts after
stash pop
, Git will tell you where to resolve them.
���� Option 2:
Discard all local changes and pull fresh
If you're okay with
losing your local changes and files
, and just want to force your repo to match the remote:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
git pull
reset --hard HEAD
: resets all tracked files (like
README.md
).
clean -fd
: removes all untracked files and folders (like those new
omniology
.txt
files).
������
This is destructive
��� your local changes will be gone.
���� Option 3:
Manually commit your changes first
If those changes are important, you might just want to commit them before pulling:
bash
Copiar c��digo
git add .
git commit -m
"Save work before pull"
git pull
After that, you can tidy up or squash commits later.
Let me know if you want a safer or more specific route (like backing up the untracked files somewhere first), or what your ideal outcome is!
