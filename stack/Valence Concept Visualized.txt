Do you think we can make this more clear and intuitive?

Valence, or hedonic tone, is the affects' property specifying the intrinsic attractiveness/"good[ness]" (positive valence) or averseness/"bad[ness]" (negative valence) of an object, event, or situation.[1][2] The term also categorises emotions.[2]

Certainly! To visually represent the concept of valence in emotions, we could create an image that illustrates the spectrum of emotional responses. This image could show a range of facial expressions, each representing a different emotional state, from positive valence (joy, contentment) to negative valence (sadness, anger). The expressions could be depicted on a gradient, transitioning smoothly from positive to negative, symbolizing the continuous spectrum of emotional valence. This visual representation would help in understanding how emotions can be categorized based on their intrinsic attractiveness or averseness. Let's create this image.
Here is a visual representation of the concept of emotional valence. The image illustrates a spectrum of facial expressions, showing the transition from positive emotions like joy and contentment to negative emotions such as sadness and anger. This range of expressions symbolizes the continuous spectrum of emotional valence, helping to understand how emotions are categorized based on their intrinsic attractiveness or averseness.

To clarify the paragraph for Wikipedia, we can rephrase it like this:
"Valence, also known as hedonic tone, is a characteristic of emotions that determines their intrinsic appeal or repulsion. Positive valence corresponds to the 'goodness' or attractiveness of an object, event, or situation, making it appealing or desirable. Conversely, negative valence relates to 'badness' or averseness, rendering something unappealing or undesirable. This concept is not only used to describe the intrinsic qualities of objects and events but also categorizes emotions based on their inherent attractiveness or averseness."
This rephrased version aims to make the concept more accessible and understandable.

Ok. Thank you. Here is what I settled on:


'''Valence''', also known as hedonic tone, is a characteristic of emotions that determines their [[Affect  (psychology)| emotional affect]] (intrinsic appeal or repulsion).

Positive valence corresponds to the "goodness" or attractiveness of an object, event, or situation, making it appealing or desirable. Conversely, negative valence relates to "badness" or averseness, rendering something unappealing or undesirable. 

This concept is not only used to describe the intrinsic qualities of objects and events but also categorizes emotions based on their inherent [[pleasure|attractiveness]] or [[suffering|averseness]]."<ref>Nico H. Frijda, The Emotions. Cambridge(UK): Cambridge University Press, 1986. p. 207</ref><ref name="Vazard (2022)"/>

Your revised paragraph for Wikipedia on valence is well-structured and clear. It effectively explains the concept of valence as a characteristic of emotions, emphasizing its role in determining the intrinsic appeal or repulsion of emotions. The distinction between positive and negative valence is neatly outlined, and the application of this concept to both emotions and the intrinsic qualities of objects and events is highlighted. The references added at the end provide a solid basis for the information presented. This should make the concept more accessible and understandable to readers. Well done!
