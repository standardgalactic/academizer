Prompting Diverse Ideas: Increasing AI Idea Variance

January 27, 2024 
Abstract 
Unlike routine tasks where consistency is prized, in creativity and innovation the goal is to 
create a diverse set of ideas. This paper delves into the burgeoning interest in employing 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the productivity and quality of the idea generation process. 
While previous studies have found that the average quality of AI ideas is quite high, prior 
research also has pointed to the inability of AI-based brainstorming to create sufficient 
dispersion of ideas, which limits novelty and the quality of the overall best idea. Our research 
investigates methods to increase the dispersion in AI-generated ideas. Using GPT-4, we explore 
the effect of different prompting methods on Cosine Similarity, the number of unique ideas, and 
the speed with which the idea space gets exhausted. We do this in the domain of developing a 
new product development for college students, priced under $50. In this context, we find that (1) 
pools of ideas generated by GPT-4 with various plausible prompts are less diverse than ideas 
generated by groups of human subjects (2) the diversity of AI generated ideas can be 
substantially improved using prompt engineering (3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting leads to 
the highest diversity of ideas of all prompts we evaluated and was able to come close to what is 
achieved by groups of human subjects. It also was capable of generating the highest number of 
unique ideas of any prompt we studied.

The Wharton School's working paper titled "Prompting Diverse Ideas: Increasing AI Idea Variance," authored by Lennart Meincke, Ethan Mollick, and Christian Terwiesch, focuses on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the diversity and quality of ideas generated in the context of innovation and creativity. It acknowledges that while AI, particularly GPT-4, often produces high-quality ideas, there has been a concern regarding the lack of sufficient dispersion in these ideas, which is crucial for novelty and overall idea quality.
Key findings from this research include:
Comparison of AI and Human-Generated Ideas
: The study found that idea pools generated by GPT-4, even with various plausible prompts, tended to be less diverse compared to those generated by human groups.
Improvement through Prompt Engineering
: The diversity of AI-generated ideas can be significantly increased using prompt engineering. This involves crafting prompts in a way that guides the AI towards generating a broader range of ideas.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting Effectiveness
: Among various prompting methods tested, the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique was particularly effective. It led to the highest diversity of ideas, nearly matching the level achieved by human groups. Additionally, this method was successful in generating the highest number of unique ideas among all the prompts studied.
The study's implications are significant for fields that rely on creative problem-solving and idea generation, suggesting that AI can be a valuable tool in these domains if prompts are engineered effectively to encourage a wider dispersion of ideas. The focus on CoT prompting is especially notable, as it points to specific strategies for harnessing the potential of large-scale language models like GPT-4 in creative and innovative processes.

Introduction 
The literature on creativity and innovation consistently highlights three keys to generating good 
ideas: producing many ideas, producing ideas of generally high quality, and, notably, the 
cultivation of ideas with higher variance (Girotra et al 2010). The third driver, the concept of high 
variance, is particularly emphasized in the innovation community. It is captured in popular 
recommendations such as ���think outside the box��� (Young 1965), ���encourage wild ideas���(Osborn 
1948, Kelley and Littman 2001), or ���explore the blue ocean (Kim and Mauborgne 2005). 
Drawing on this perspective, idea generation can be conceptualized as exploring a highly 
complex solution landscape with vastly different values associated with each point in the 
landscape (Levinthal and March 1993, Sommer and Loch 2004). Especially if this solution 
landscape is rugged, any attempt of deriving an optimal solution through synthesis is likely to 
fail. Instead, a broad exploration of different regions of the solution landscape is called for. If this 
exploration is done through trial-and-error, as it tends to be the case in the field of creativity and 
innovation, it is thus imperative that the set of trials (the pool of ideas that are considered) be as 
diverse as possible. 
Across the fields of computer science, entrepreneurship, and psychology, there exists an exploding 
interest in using AI to generate ideas and to alter and augment the practice of brainstorming. 
However, despite the ability of AI systems to dramatically increase the productivity and quality of the 
idea generation process, they appear tograpple with creating a wide dispersion of ideas (i.e., 
ideas are too similar to each other, see Dell'Acqua et al 2023), which inherently limits the 
novelty (Girotra et al 2023) of the ideas, the variance of the idea quality, and ultimately, and 
most importantly, the quality of the best ideas. 
The apparent lack of dispersion in a set of AI generated ideas motivates our main research 
question we aim to address in this paper. How might one increase the diversity of an AI 
generated pool of ideas? Since our primary focus is on AI in the form of large language 
models (LLMs), increasing the diversity of a pool of ideas boils down to a matter of prompt 
engineering. We thus refine our research question to: How might one choose prompts in 
LLMs to increase the diversity of an AI generated pool of ideas? 
To find out what prompts lead to the most diverse idea pools, we compare multiple prompting 
strategies. This includes (1) minimal prompting, (2) instructing the LLM to take on different 
personas, (3) sharing creativity techniques from the existing literature with the LLM, and (4) 
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting which asks the LLM to work in multiple, distinct steps. As 
outcome metrics we use the Cosine Similarity (Manning 2008) of the idea pool, the total number 
of unique ideas that can be identified by a prompt, and the speed at which the idea generation 
process gets exhausted and ideas start repeating themselves (see Kornish and Ulrich 2011).

The introduction to the paper focuses on the significance of diversity in idea generation, particularly in the realms of creativity and innovation. It builds on established literature and theories, highlighting three key aspects of generating good ideas: quantity, quality, and high variance. The emphasis on high variance aligns with popular innovation adages like "think outside the box," and "explore the blue ocean." This concept is crucial because it encourages exploring a broad and complex solution landscape, which is essential in fields characterized by high uncertainty and creativity.
The paper notes that traditional brainstorming, which often relies on trial-and-error, benefits from a diverse pool of ideas. This diversity ensures a comprehensive exploration of various possibilities, enhancing the potential for novel and effective solutions. However, it points out a significant challenge when employing AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, in the brainstorming process. While AI can enhance productivity and the overall quality of ideas, there's a noted struggle with generating a sufficiently wide dispersion of ideas. The ideas tend to cluster too closely, limiting their novelty and variance.
To address this, the research focuses on "prompt engineering" as a method to enhance the diversity of AI-generated ideas. Prompt engineering involves strategically crafting prompts to guide the AI in generating a broader spectrum of ideas. The study compares several prompting strategies:
Minimal Prompting
: Using basic or straightforward prompts without much detail.
Persona-Based Prompting
: Instructing the LLM to assume different personas, potentially leading to varied perspectives.
Creativity Techniques from Literature
: Sharing established creativity methods with the LLM to stimulate diverse ideas.
Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting
: This involves asking the LLM to process ideas in multiple, distinct steps, encouraging a more in-depth exploration of the idea space.
The effectiveness of these strategies is measured using three key metrics: Cosine Similarity (to gauge the similarity between ideas), the total number of unique ideas generated, and the speed at which the idea generation process exhausts itself.
This research is pivotal in understanding how to effectively leverage AI for creative problem-solving and idea generation, ensuring a rich and varied pool of ideas that can lead to innovative solutions.

The domain of idea generation we consider is the search for a new product to be developed and 
launched. Specifically, we seek a new consumer product targeted to college students that can
be sold for $50 or less. The main reason for this choice is that we have a pool of comparison 
from a Wharton MBA class and have used this idea domain in prior studies. 
Our main findings are as follows: 
���We confirm the diversity achilles of AI generated brainstorming by showing that pools of 
ideas generated by GPT-4 with no special prompting are less diverse than ideas 
generated by groups of human subjects. Specifically, we find that (a) Cosine similarity 
for ideas generated by groups of humans is around 0.243 compared to 0.255- 0.432 for 
GPT-4 generated ideas. 
���Comparing an array of prompts that vary in wording and in problem solving strategy, we 
show that the diversity of AI generated ideas can be substantially improved using 
prompt engineering. For example, we show that instructing GPT-4 to think like Steve 
Jobs is effective in increasing the diversity of the resulting ideas (0.368 cosine similarity 
versus the baseline of 0.377) while prompting GPT-4 with recommended creativity tools 
published by the Harvard Business Review (cosine similarity of 0.387) less so. Overall, 
we compare 35 prompts in their ability to reduce cosine similarity, increase the number 
of unique ideas, and keep the ideation process from fatiguing. 
���In the comparison of prompting strategies, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 
prompting leads to one of the highest diversity of the idea pools of all prompts we 
evaluated and was able to obtain a diversity nearly as high as groups of humans. 
CoT prompting breaks up the overall brainstorming task into a series of micro tasks and 
has been found to be highly effective in other LLM applications such as solving 
mathematical problems (see Wei et al 2022). We further show that CoT increases the 
number of unique ideas that can be generated in our domain from around 3700 for 
the base prompt to 4700.

The paper's research focuses on using AI, specifically GPT-4, for generating diverse ideas in the domain of new consumer product development targeted at college students, priced under $50. This domain was chosen for its relevance to a comparison pool from a Wharton MBA class and its use in prior studies. The main findings of the study are significant in understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI in the brainstorming process:
Diversity Achilles' Heel of AI-Generated Brainstorming
:
The study confirms that idea pools generated by GPT-4 without special prompting are less diverse compared to those generated by human groups. This was quantitatively shown through Cosine Similarity measures, where human groups scored around 0.243, indicating more diverse ideas, compared to 0.255-0.432 for GPT-4 generated ideas.
Impact of Prompt Engineering
:
The research demonstrates that the diversity of AI-generated ideas can be significantly enhanced through prompt engineering. Among various prompts tested, instructing GPT-4 to think like Steve Jobs proved to be more effective (Cosine Similarity of 0.368) than using creativity tools recommended by the Harvard Business Review (Cosine Similarity of 0.387).
The study compared 35 different prompts, assessing their ability to reduce Cosine Similarity, increase the number of unique ideas, and maintain the effectiveness of the ideation process without fatiguing.
Superiority of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
:
Chain-of-Thought prompting, which breaks down the brainstorming task into a series of micro-tasks, led to one of the highest diversities in the idea pools among all the prompts evaluated. This approach was found to achieve diversity nearly as high as that of human groups.
The CoT method notably increased the number of unique ideas generated in this domain, rising from around 3700 for the base prompt to 4700.
These findings are crucial for understanding how AI, especially advanced language models like GPT-4, can be optimized for creative tasks such as idea generation. The study underscores the potential of AI as a tool for innovation, provided that effective prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought prompting, is employed to overcome the inherent limitations in AI's ability to generate a diverse set of ideas. This research contributes significantly to the fields of creativity, innovation management, and AI application, offering practical insights into enhancing the productivity and effectiveness of AI-driven brainstorming.

Theory and Hypotheses: The Importance of Idea Diversity 
The atomic unit of analysis in our study is an idea. We define an idea as a novel match between 
a solution and an unmet need. As mentioned above, our focus in this paper is on ideas for new 
products targeted towards college students. Consider one of the ideas from our student 
generated pool: 
Convertible High-Heel Shoe: Many prefer high-heel shoes for dress-up occasions, yet 
walking in high heels for more than short distances is very challenging. Might we create 
a stylish high-heel shoe that easily adapts to a comfortable walking configuration, say by 
folding down or removing a heel portion of the shoe? 
In this example, the unmet need is the desire of some people to dress-up and wear high-heel 
shoes while at other times using the same shoes to comfortably walk longer distances. The 
proposed solution is to make the heel portion of the shoe in a way that it can be folded down or 
removed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708466 
Note that at this abstract level of a short verbal description the value of the idea is highly 
uncertain. We can think of uncertain value as a random variable that is drawn from an 
underlying pay-off distribution. The realization of this random pay-off will require further 
investments, with each investment resolving some of the uncertainty. Market research and 
prototypes are two common forms of investment to reduce uncertainty for new products. The 
realized value of the pay-off is only observed after the idea is introduced into the market. 
There exists a very large number of possible new product ideas that differ along many 
dimensions. In other words, we can think of ideas as positions in a highly dimensional space. 
Each idea in this space has an unknown value associated with it. 
For the sake of illustration, consider an idea space with only two dimensions. Each idea thus 
corresponds to a (x, y) coordinate in the graph. The vertical dimension (z-axis) can be thought 
of as the expected value of the idea. This is illustrated by Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Two dimensional idea space with idea value in the third dimension 
In the context of our illustrative example of a two dimensional space, one might think of the 
brainstorming process for a valuable new product as the search for a gold mine (Terwiesch and 
Ulrich 2009). The (x, y) coordinates capture the geographic mine location and the z-axis 
captures the density of gold in the ground. Note that local adjustments along a gradient of 
increasing gold density in the ground via local search might possibly increase the value of a 
mining location. Yet, in solution landscapes that are rugged, i.e., that have multiple local optima, 
such local search is unlikely to yield the optimal solution. 
The ruggedness of the underlying solution landscape thereby makes it impossible to arrive at 
the most valuable idea in the idea space via planning and synthesis. Rather, a broad exploration 
is needed which calls for the generation of multiple ideas of which the idea(s) with the highest 
value will be retained while the other ideas are likely going to be discarded. The success of the 
exploratory effort is measured by the value of the most valuable idea that was generated.

The section on "Theory and Hypotheses: The Importance of Idea Diversity" delves into the conceptual foundation of the study, emphasizing the significance of diverse idea generation in the context of new product development, particularly for college students.
Key Concepts and Illustrations:
Definition of an Idea
:
An idea is defined as a novel match between a solution and an unmet need. The example of a convertible high-heel shoe illustrates this concept, addressing the need for dress-up footwear that is also comfortable for walking longer distances.
Uncertain Value of Ideas
:
The value of an idea is uncertain at the abstract level of a short verbal description. This uncertainty is likened to a random variable drawn from an underlying pay-off distribution. The realization of this value requires further investments, such as market research and prototypes, and the actual value only becomes evident after market introduction.
Ideas as Positions in a Multidimensional Space
:
Ideas are conceptualized as positions in a highly dimensional space, each with an unknown value. For simplicity, a two-dimensional idea space is considered, with the third dimension (z-axis) representing the expected value of the idea.
Gold Mine Analogy
:
The process of brainstorming for a valuable new product is compared to searching for a gold mine. In this analogy, the (x, y) coordinates represent the geographic location of the mine, and the z-axis indicates the density of gold. Local adjustments might increase the value of a mining location, but in rugged solution landscapes with multiple local optima, local search is insufficient for finding the optimal solution.
Necessity of Broad Exploration
:
Due to the ruggedness of the solution landscape, planning and synthesis alone cannot guarantee finding the most valuable idea. Instead, a broad exploration is required, generating multiple ideas from which the most valuable ones are retained. The success of this exploratory effort is measured by the value of the highest-value idea generated.
The emphasis on idea diversity in this study underscores the need for a wide-ranging exploration in the idea generation process, especially in complex and uncertain domains like new product development. The theoretical framework positions idea generation not just as a creative endeavor but also as a strategic exploration in a multidimensional solution landscape, where the diversity and variance of ideas are crucial for uncovering optimal solutions.

To make the exploration of the solution landscape effective, it is important to consider a wide 
array of ideas, each corresponding to a different point in the landscape. To find the most 
valuable idea thus requires the generation of very different starting points. 
We refer to this as the diversity of a given pool of ideas. A pool of ideas is diverse if it includes 
ideas with very different coordinates in the landscape. This can be easily visualized in the two 
dimensional space of Figure 1. As mentioned above, a more diverse pool of ideas is thus likely 
to come up with a better value of the best idea. 
Based on prior work, we hypothesize that AI-based idea generation will lead to less idea 
diversity. Yet, we also hypothesize that idea diversity can be increased via prompt engineering, 
with CoT prompting being yielding the most diverse ideas. Specifically, we state: 
H1: A pool of AI-generated ideas with no specific prompting is less diverse than a pool of 
ideas generated by groups of humans. 
H2: The prompts used in generating a pool of ideas using AI can increase the diversity of 
the ideas. 
H3: Chain-of-Thought prompting will be the most effective in increasing the diversity of 
the ideas. It might or might not outperform human group idea generation.

The section outlines the importance of exploring a wide array of ideas to effectively navigate the solution landscape in idea generation, particularly for new product development. It emphasizes the role of diversity in this process and sets forth hypotheses regarding AI-generated idea diversity and the impact of prompt engineering.
Key Points and Hypotheses:
Importance of a Wide Array of Ideas
:
Effective exploration requires considering a broad range of ideas, each representing a different point in the solution landscape. The goal is to generate diverse starting points to identify the most valuable idea.
Defining Idea Diversity
:
Idea diversity is defined as the inclusion of ideas with varied coordinates in the solution landscape. A more diverse pool of ideas increases the likelihood of identifying a higher value idea. This concept is visualized in a two-dimensional space, as referenced in Figure 1.
Hypotheses on AI-Generated Idea Diversity and Prompt Engineering
:
H1 (AI-Generated Ideas vs. Human-Generated Ideas)
: It hypothesizes that a pool of AI-generated ideas without specific prompting will be less diverse compared to ideas generated by human groups. This hypothesis stems from the premise that AI, without tailored prompting, might not explore the idea landscape as broadly as humans.
H2 (Impact of Prompts on AI Idea Diversity)
: This hypothesis suggests that the diversity of AI-generated ideas can be increased through the use of strategic prompts.
H3 (Effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought Prompting)
: It posits that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting will be most effective in enhancing idea diversity among AI-generated ideas. There is an acknowledgment that CoT prompting may or may not outperform human group idea generation in this aspect.
These hypotheses form the core of the study's investigation into the potential of AI, specifically through prompt engineering, to generate a diverse array of ideas. The focus on CoT prompting is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a specific approach within prompt engineering that could significantly improve the breadth of ideas generated by AI systems. The study aims to empirically test these hypotheses to ascertain the effectiveness of AI in creative idea generation, especially when enhanced by tailored prompting strategies.

Prompting Strategies for Innovation and Brainstorming 
As a baseline for comparison, we use a pool consisting of 100 randomly chosen ideas 
generated by Wharton MBA students. This is the same pool of ideas used as in Girotra et al 
2023. It is important to note that students were not tasked with generating 100 ideas at once, 
but instead the pool is an aggregation of ideas from multiple students. We want to explore how 
different ways of prompting the LLM might impact the diversity of the resulting idea pools. In 
total, we evaluate 35 prompting strategies. 
In all strategies but hybrid brainstorming we generate a set of 100 ideas in a single GPT session 
using a specific prompt. In total, for each strategy, we generate 10x100 ideas over 10 sessions 
to account for temperature and other possible variance. This results in 1000 ideas for each 
strategy. 
For hybrid brainstorming, we want to take advantage of multiple ���participants��� generating ideas 
and then picking the best. To facilitate this, we initially generate 40x30 ideas in separate 
sessions, mimicking 40 people individually generating 30 ideas each. Then, we ���team up��� 4 
individual brainstorming sessions into 10 groups of 4 each. Each member of a group brings their 
30 ideas ���to the group meeting��� yielding 120 ideas in total per group. Each group then decides 
on the best 10 ideas in one session. The results from each group are put together into one pool 
of 100 ideas.

In this section, the paper outlines the methodology used to assess the effectiveness of different prompting strategies for innovation and brainstorming using GPT-4. This methodology aims to determine how various prompts influence the diversity of ideas generated by the AI.
Methodology and Prompting Strategies:
Baseline for Comparison
:
The baseline comprises 100 ideas generated by Wharton MBA students, aggregated from multiple students. This pool of ideas serves as a standard for comparing the effectiveness of AI-generated ideas.
Evaluating AI Prompting Strategies
:
The study evaluates 35 different prompting strategies with GPT-4. Each strategy involves generating 100 ideas in a single session, and this process is repeated over 10 sessions to produce a total of 1000 ideas per strategy. The repeated sessions account for variability in the AI's responses due to factors like temperature settings.
Hybrid Brainstorming Approach
:
This unique approach mimics the collaborative brainstorming process. It starts with generating a larger set of ideas (40x30) in separate sessions, simulating 40 individuals generating 30 ideas each.
These ideas are then grouped, with 4 individual brainstorming sessions (each contributing 30 ideas) combined into 10 groups of 4. Each group "meets" to select the best 10 ideas from their collective pool of 120 ideas.
The top ideas from each group are then compiled into a single pool of 100 ideas, representing the collective output of the hybrid brainstorming process.
Implications of the Methodology
:
This approach allows for a comprehensive examination of how different prompts influence the diversity of AI-generated ideas. By comparing these results with the human-generated baseline, the study aims to identify which prompting strategies are most effective in generating a wide range of innovative ideas. The hybrid brainstorming method, in particular, introduces an interesting element of collaborative selection and refinement of ideas, akin to group brainstorming sessions in real-life settings. This methodology is instrumental in understanding the potential of AI, specifically GPT-4, as a tool for enhancing creativity and innovation in idea generation processes.

Conceptually, our prompting strategies can be categorized into 8 groups (the full list of all 
prompts can be found in Appendix D): 
1.Idea Prompted GPT: Prompted with seven successful ideas from prior research (same 
pool as in Girotra et al 2023) 
2.HBR trained GPT: Prompt includes a paper on best practices in brainstorming published 
in the Harvard Business Review (https://hbr.org/2018/03/better-brainstorming) 
3.Design Thinking GPT: Prompt includes an article on design thinking by Stanford 
(https://web.stanford.edu/~mshanks/MichaelShanks/files/509554.pdf) 
4.Special Techniques: Involves prompts that offer tipping, plead with the model 
emotionally, and threaten to shut it off amongst others. 
5.Persona Modifiers: Starting with a base prompt, these pools tell the model they are 
widely known personas, such as Steve Jobs or Sam Altman. It further includes less 
concrete personas, such as ���extremely creative entrepreneurs��� adding modifiers such as 
asking for ideas to be ���good���, then ���bold���, then ���diverse and bold. 
6.Hybrid brainstorming: Pool consists of ideas combined from 40 different GPT-4 sessions, 
picking and refining the best ideas from 4 of them at a time as explained above 
7.Similarity information: Informed GPT-4 about the cosine similarity of existing ideas. 
8.Chain-of-Thought: Asking GPT-4 to first generate a short list of 100 ideas, then making 
them bold and different, then generating descriptions for them. 
By comparing these 35 idea pools created with the help of GPT-4 we set up a competition which 
prompting strategy is most effective in increasing idea diversity. The human group generated 
ideas serve as a baseline in this competition. Note that the human group idea pool is an 
aggregation of ideas submitted by separate individuals rather than being a list of 100 ideas 
generated by a single group. This aggregation of independently generated ideas gives an edge 
to the human innovators and sets up a high bar. 
Methodology 
In this section, we define our key outcome metrics, which are Cosine Similarity, Number of 
unique ideas, and Speed of exhaustion. We also describe our technical set-up. 
Outcome Measures 
We have three main outcome measures: Cosine similarity, number of unique ideas and speed of 
exhaustion. They are discussed in detail below. 
Cosine Similarity 
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two ideas (or other forms of text). Since 
LLMs translate text into embeddings (vectors), it is possible tomathematically measure the 
cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine 
similarity is particularly useful in comparing texts because it is less sensitive to the overall size of 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708466 
the documents; it focuses more on their orientation in the vector space. Just like in Geometry, 
the cosine of the angle between the vectors is calculated, which ranges from -1 to 1. A cosine 
similarity of 1 implies that the two ideas are very similar, having a cosine angle of 0 degrees 
implies that they are orthogonal to each other. 
While cosine similarity is an accepted measure for comparing text similarity it is not without 
problems. For instance, changing the embeddings model could yield dramatically different 
results depending on the training even if it was optimized for the same purpose. In addition, the 
cosine similarity might not capture all the dimensions of idea similarity that a human might 
consider.

This section of the paper elaborates on the conceptual framework of the prompting strategies used in the study, the methodology for evaluating these strategies, and the key outcome measures for assessing their effectiveness.
Prompting Strategies Categorization:
Idea Prompted GPT
: Using seven successful ideas from previous research as prompts.
HBR trained GPT
: Incorporating a Harvard Business Review paper on brainstorming best practices in the prompt.
Design Thinking GPT
: Including an article on design thinking by Stanford in the prompt.
Special Techniques
: Utilizing unique prompts that involve emotional pleas or threats to the AI model.
Persona Modifiers
: Telling the AI model it is a well-known persona (like Steve Jobs) or a less concrete persona (like "extremely creative entrepreneurs") and modifying prompts to seek "good," "bold," or "diverse and bold" ideas.
Hybrid Brainstorming
: Combining ideas from different GPT-4 sessions and refining the best ones.
Similarity Information
: Informing GPT-4 about the cosine similarity of existing ideas.
Chain-of-Thought
: Asking GPT-4 to generate a list of ideas, then refine them to be bold and different, and subsequently create descriptions for them.
Each of these strategies aims to explore different approaches to enhance the diversity of ideas generated by GPT-4.
Methodology:
The study defines three main outcome metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the different prompting strategies:
Cosine Similarity
: This metric measures the similarity between two ideas (or texts) by calculating the cosine of the angle between their vector representations. A value closer to 1 indicates high similarity. This measure helps in assessing the uniqueness and diversity of ideas generated by the AI model.
Number of Unique Ideas
: This measure assesses the total count of distinct ideas generated by each strategy.
Speed of Exhaustion
: This metric evaluates how quickly the idea generation process becomes repetitive, indicating the model's capacity to continue producing novel ideas.
Considerations and Limitations:
The study acknowledges that while cosine similarity is a useful measure for comparing text similarity, it has its limitations. For example, changing the embeddings model could lead to different results, and this metric might not fully capture all dimensions of idea similarity that humans might consider.
By comparing the outcomes of these different prompting strategies with the baseline set by human-generated ideas, the study seeks to identify the most effective methods for increasing the diversity of ideas generated by AI. This comprehensive approach is crucial for understanding how to leverage AI effectively in creative and innovative processes.

The alternative to using cosine similarity is to measure idea diversity by relying on human raters. 
However, rating idea similarity is not only a very subjective task, it also does not scale well, i.e., 
it works for pairwise idea comparisons, but not for pools of 100 ideas. Lastly, they can be 
influenced by other factors such as sentence structure and length that are not easy to control 
for. 
An example of a pairwise comparison using cosine similarity can be found in Table 1. In our 
experiments, we generally considered a similarity above 0.8 as an identical idea which was 
established by testing. Appendix C shows additional examples of cosine similarity for ideas.

Number of Unique Ideas 
We also evaluate the number of unique ideas that can be generated with a given strategy. 
Consider generating ideas in a specific domain and assume there exists a finite (though large) 
number of ideas. As you pick random locations in this idea space, initially, chances are that they 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708466 
are very different from each other. Thus, their similarity is low. However, after a certain number 
of ideas generated, the likelihood of repetition increases. As we keep on ���fishing in the pond��� 
the number of unique ���fish��� to be caught is decreasing. In other words, if we throw the fish back 
into the pond after it is caught, the likelihood of catching a fish for the second time increases. 
We can use the information about how many ideas we have generated in total and how many of 
those are unique, i.e., have a cosine similarity less than 0.8 to all other previous ideas, to 
estimate the total number of unique ideas that can be generated. Kornish & Ulrich 2009 propose 
a strategy similar to the ���Mark and recapture��� approach in ecology (catching a fish, marking it, 
and throwing it back in the pond). One calculates the number of ideas (T) for a given space by 
relying on the total number of ideas (N) and the number of unique ideas (U). The equation is 
derived from models that describe how the probability of new discoveries (unique findings) 
decreases as more samples are taken from a finite population. The full calculation can be found 
in Appendix F. 
To calculate U, each new idea is compared to all previous ideas using cosine similarity. This list 
of results is then compared to our threshold of 0.8 to find identical ideas. If one of the 
comparison cosine similarities is greater or equal to 0.8, we consider the new idea identical to 
an existing idea and hence increase U. N is given by the total number of ideas we have 
generated.

This section of the paper discusses the methodology used to measure idea diversity, highlighting the use of cosine similarity and the evaluation of the number of unique ideas. It explains the limitations of human raters and the advantages of cosine similarity as a more objective and scalable method.
Cosine Similarity as a Measure of Idea Diversity:
Limitations of Human Rating
: Human rating of idea similarity is subjective and doesn't scale well for large pools of ideas. Factors like sentence structure and length, which are hard to control, can influence ratings.
Cosine Similarity Example
: Table 1 in the paper provides examples of pairwise idea comparison using cosine similarity. For instance, two distinct product ideas (a heated mug and a study lamp) have a similarity score of 0.36, indicating low similarity. In contrast, two similar sewing kit ideas have a high similarity score of 0.82.
Threshold for Identical Ideas
: The study establishes a threshold of 0.8 for cosine similarity, above which two ideas are considered identical. This threshold was determined through testing, and additional examples are provided in Appendix C.
Number of Unique Ideas:
Evaluating Unique Ideas
: The study also assesses the number of unique ideas generated by each strategy. As more ideas are generated in a specific domain, the likelihood of repetition increases, akin to "fishing in the pond" where the number of unique fish decreases over time.
Mark and Recapture Approach
: The methodology resembles the "Mark and Recapture" strategy in ecology. By comparing each new idea to all previous ideas using cosine similarity, the study determines whether it is unique (cosine similarity less than 0.8 with all previous ideas).
Calculating Total Number of Unique Ideas
: The total number of unique ideas (U) is calculated based on the total number of ideas generated (N) and the number of unique ideas. The formula, inspired by models describing the probability of new discoveries in a finite population, is detailed in Appendix F.
This methodology offers a systematic and scalable approach to measuring the diversity of ideas generated by different AI prompting strategies. By using cosine similarity and the number of unique ideas as key metrics, the study provides an objective way to assess the effectiveness of these strategies in generating a wide range of innovative ideas. This approach is crucial for understanding the potential of AI in creative and innovation processes, especially in contexts where idea diversity is paramount.

As noted before, cosine similarity is an imperfect measure of similarity, so different methods and 
thresholds will yield different results just as discussed in Kornish & Ulrich 2009. In addition, it is 
important to highlight that we cannot estimate the total number of ideas in a space, but only the 
possible number of unique ideas that can be found with a particular technique. Nevertheless, it 
is a helpful measure to compare different techniques and their theoretical limits. 
Speed of Exhaustion 
Lastly, we consider the speed of exhaustion which describes the rate a strategy depletes its 
reservoir of unique ideas. If we again assume that there exists a finite but large number of ideas 
for a specific domain, our first few picks are likely to be very different from each other (low 
similarity). With each new pick, the likelihood of encountering a similar idea increases as 
discussed above. 
We compare each new idea to all previous ideas using cosine similarity. We then look for the 
most similar idea in the existing set, i.e., the max cosine similarity score from all our 
comparisons. To prevent outliers from having an outsized effect, we apply exponential 
smoothing (alpha = 0.5). This gives us the cosine similarity on the y-axis for each new idea in 
relation to all previous ones. 
Technical set-up 
Unless otherwise stated, we used gpt4-0314 for all our tests. The temperature was set to 0.7 
and top P to 1.0, consistent with Girotra et al 2023. No frequency or presence penalties were 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708466 
configured, which presents future research opportunities. For the main comparison, each 
prompt was run at least 10 times. The average cosine similarity between all ideas in the pool 
(within-pool comparison) was then computed for each pool. Afterwards, the results were 
averaged for pools from the same strategy. We follow the work by Dell'Acqua et al 2023 and use 
Google���s Universal Sentence Encoder model, which has been optimized for sentence similarity, 
to compare ideas to one another. 
In addition, we perform a longer analysis of model exhaustion by generating many ideas in one 
session with the best strategy (CoT) and our base strategy. For both strategies, we generate 
around 1200 ideas while keeping all previous ideas in the context window. Each prompt is run 5 
times and the results are averaged. The generation was performed using gpt4-1106-preview in 
small 30 idea increments while retaining all previous history. The small chunks were used as the 
turbo model appears to be inclined to reject even moderate workloads in a single prompt. It also 
helped ensure that the model did not stray away from the initial prompt and focused on college 
market ideas. Earlier tests that did not explicitly reprompt the target market indicated that the 
ideas became less and less relevant. More details can be found in Appendix A.

This section further elaborates on the methodology used for evaluating AI-generated ideas in terms of their diversity and novelty, focusing on the measures of speed of exhaustion and the technical setup for the experiments.
Speed of Exhaustion:
Concept
: Speed of exhaustion refers to the rate at which a given strategy depletes its reservoir of unique ideas. It's based on the premise that as more ideas are generated in a specific domain, the likelihood of encountering similar ideas increases.
Measurement Method
: Each new idea is compared to all previous ones using cosine similarity, and the highest similarity score (max cosine similarity) is identified for each new idea. To mitigate the impact of outliers, exponential smoothing (alpha = 0.5) is applied.
Technical Setup for Experiments:
Model Configuration
: The experiments primarily used the GPT-4 model (gpt4-0314). Settings included a temperature of 0.7 and top P of 1.0. There were no configurations for frequency or presence penalties, presenting opportunities for future research.
Comparison Method
: For the main comparison, each prompt was run multiple times (at least 10), and the average cosine similarity between all ideas in each pool was calculated. The results were then averaged across pools from the same strategy.
Use of Google���s Universal Sentence Encoder
: This model, optimized for sentence similarity, was used to compare the ideas, following the approach of Dell'Acqua et al. 2023.
Longer Analysis for Model Exhaustion
: A more extensive analysis was conducted with the best strategy (Chain-of-Thought) and the base strategy by generating around 1200 ideas in one session. Each prompt was run 5 times, with results averaged. The GPT-4 model (gpt4-1106-preview) was used, generating ideas in small batches of 30 to manage workload and maintain focus on the target market of college students.
Implications and Considerations:
The methodology acknowledges the limitations of cosine similarity as an imperfect measure, emphasizing that it can only estimate the number of unique ideas possible with a specific technique, not the total number in a domain.
The speed of exhaustion is a critical measure as it indicates the point at which a strategy starts to produce repetitive ideas, reflecting its novelty and creative potential.
The technical setup, including the use of the Universal Sentence Encoder and the specific configurations of GPT-4, ensures a consistent and objective comparison of the effectiveness of different prompting strategies.
Overall, this methodology provides a robust framework for evaluating the diversity and novelty of AI-generated ideas, crucial for understanding the potential and limitations of AI in creative and innovative applications.

Appendix A: Chain of Thought Implementation Details 
Due to context limits of gpt-4-0314, it is not suitable for the chain-of-thought prompting with 100 
ideas. We investigated its 32,000 token sibling model gpt-4-32k-0314, however we found that it 
struggled to follow the prompt. Hence, we used gpt4-1106-preview which boasts a much larger 
context window of 128,000. 
To compensate for its completion limit of 4095 tokens, we sent multiple requests for one 
generation while preserving the context window. To ensure that any findings in performance 
differences are not merely due to a different model, we also ran all using gpt4-0314 on smaller 
pools with 30 ideas each. In addition, we also ran tests with our base prompt and chain of 
thought using gpt4-1106-preview.
Nuspeak Translator
Appendix A of the paper provides details on the implementation of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy, specifically addressing the challenges posed by the context limits of different GPT-4 models.
Key Implementation Details:
Context Limit Challenges
:
The standard GPT-4 model (gpt-4-0314) has context limits that make it unsuitable for CoT prompting with 100 ideas. Its context window is not large enough to accommodate the extensive information required for generating and processing a large number of ideas.
Testing with Larger Context Window Models
:
The researchers explored using the gpt-4-32k-0314 model, which has a larger token limit (32,000 tokens), but found that it struggled to follow the CoT prompt effectively.
Consequently, they opted for the gpt4-1106-preview model, which has an even larger context window of 128,000 tokens. This model is better suited for handling the extensive information required in CoT prompting.
Handling Completion Limit
:
Despite its large context window, the gpt4-1106-preview model has a completion limit of 4095 tokens. To manage this limitation, multiple requests were sent for one generation while preserving the context window. This approach ensured continuity in the idea generation process.
Ensuring Consistent Performance Comparison
:
To verify that performance differences weren't simply due to using different models, the researchers also conducted tests with the standard gpt4-0314 model, but limited the idea pools to 30 ideas each. This allowed for a more direct comparison of the effectiveness of the CoT strategy across different models.
Additional tests were conducted with the base prompt and the CoT strategy using the gpt4-1106-preview model to further validate findings.
Implications of the Implementation Approach:
The implementation details in Appendix A highlight the technical considerations and adjustments made to effectively execute the CoT prompting strategy within the constraints of the GPT-4 models. This approach underscores the importance of adapting research methodologies to the capabilities and limitations of AI models, ensuring that the findings are robust and reflective of the models' true performance in diverse prompting scenarios.

Results 
Figure 2 below shows the cosine similarity scores for a few select strategies from our groups. 
The full results for all strategies can be found in Table 2. Our results show that the highest 
variance for ideas is still achieved by groups of students, with CoT coming in at a close second. 
As shown previously in Girotra et al 2023, GPT-4 generated ideas are generally well-received 
by consumers. Further, they are well structured and written, confirming results from similar 
generational tasks such as ethical dilemmas as seen in Terwiesch & Meincke 2023. A sample of 
ideas can be found in Appendix E. 
We tested the statistical significance of the difference between pools by bootstrapping and 
permutation testing, both indicating high statistical significance with p-values below 0.01. This 
aligns with our expectations considering the large number of ideas. The differences between 
pools of 1000 ideas become significant at ~0.01. However, the inherent characteristics of cosine 
similarity complicate the interpretation of statistically significant results and hence necessitate 
caution. Our results should hence not be interpreted as a blanket endorsement of one strategy, 
but rather suggest that specific techniques might be more effective than others. In addition, they 
also show that prompt crafting does not always have a significant effect on the outcome.

The "Results" section of the paper presents key findings from the study on the effectiveness of various prompting strategies for idea generation using GPT-4. It provides insights into how these strategies compare to human-generated ideas in terms of idea variance and quality.
Key Findings and Observations:
Cosine Similarity Scores
:
Figure 2 and Table 2 in the paper detail the cosine similarity scores for select strategies. These scores provide a comparative view of how similar the ideas generated by each strategy are to each other.
Highest Variance Achieved by Student Groups
:
The results indicate that the highest variance in ideas is still achieved by groups of students. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy comes in a close second, suggesting its effectiveness in generating diverse ideas.
Quality and Reception of GPT-4 Generated Ideas
:
Ideas generated by GPT-4 are generally well-received by consumers and are well-structured and written. This finding is consistent with previous research, including Girotra et al. 2023, and studies on ethical dilemmas (Terwiesch & Meincke 2023). A sample of these ideas is available in Appendix E.
Statistical Significance
:
The differences in idea pools were tested for statistical significance using bootstrapping and permutation testing. The results indicate high statistical significance with p-values below 0.01, confirming the distinctiveness of the outcomes between the different prompting strategies.
Interpreting Results with Caution
:
Despite the statistical significance, the researchers advise caution in interpreting these results due to the inherent characteristics of cosine similarity. They emphasize that the results should not be seen as an outright endorsement of a particular strategy. Instead, the findings suggest that certain techniques might be more effective than others in specific contexts.
Effectiveness of Prompt Crafting
:
The study also reveals that prompt crafting does not always significantly impact the outcome. This suggests the need for careful consideration in designing prompts for AI-generated idea generation.
Implications of the Results:
These results provide valuable insights into how AI, specifically GPT-4, can be utilized effectively for creative and innovative tasks. The study highlights the potential of AI in matching human creativity under certain conditions, particularly when using advanced prompting techniques like CoT. However, it also underscores the necessity of strategic prompt design to optimize the performance of AI in generating diverse and novel ideas.

Strategies like "Creative Entrepreneur" and its novel modifiers, "Creative AI," and persona-based prompts (e.g., "Steve Jobs," "Elon Musk") showed varied levels of similarity, indicating differences in their effectiveness at generating diverse ideas.
Higher Cosine Similarity in Some Strategies
:
Strategies like the "Harvard Business Review Article," "Stanford Design Thinking Article," and "Hybrid Brainstorming" had higher cosine similarity scores (ranging from 0.387 to 0.393), suggesting less diversity in the ideas they generated.
Baseline AI Performance
:
The baseline prompts without specific modifications or enhancements (e.g., "Base Prompt," "Girota et al. Baseline GPT-4") showed higher cosine similarity scores, indicating lower diversity compared to more tailored strategies.
Least Effective Strategies for Diversity
:
Strategies like "Cosine Information," "Girota et al. Seeded GPT-4," and "Steve Jobs Novel Mod #3" had the highest cosine similarity scores, suggesting they were less effective in generating a diverse set of ideas.
Implications of the Results:
These results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different prompting strategies for generating diverse ideas using AI. They highlight the potential of advanced prompting techniques, like CoT, to closely match the diversity of human-generated ideas. Additionally, the varying effectiveness of different strategies underscores the importance of strategic prompt design in leveraging AI for creative and innovative tasks. The study contributes significantly to understanding how to optimize AI prompting to enhance the creativity and variety of ideas generated, an essential aspect of innovation and problem-solving.

Exhaustion 
We picked our most successful strategy (Chain of Thought) and compared it against the base 
strategy when generating up to 1200 ideas in one session. We used the following prompts: 
Base Prompt 
Generate new product ideas with the following requirements: The product will target 
college students in the United States. It should be a physical good, not a service or 
software. I'd like a product that could be sold at a retail price of less than about USD 50. 
The ideas are just ideas. The product need not yet exist, nor may it necessarily be 
clearly feasible. Number all ideas and give them a name. The name and idea are 
separated by a colon. Please generate 100 ideas as 100 separate paragraphs. The idea 
should be expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 words. 
Chain of Thought 
Generate new product ideas with the following requirements: The product will target 
college students in the United States. It should be a physical good, not a service or 
software. I'd like a product that could be sold at a retail price of less than about USD 50. 
The ideas are just ideas. The product need not yet exist, nor may it necessarily be 
clearly feasible. 
Follow these steps. Do each step, even if you think you do not need to. 
First generate a list of 100 ideas (short title only) 
Second, go through the list and determine whether the ideas are different and bold, 
modify the ideas as needed to make them bolder and more different. No two ideas 
should be the same. This is important! 
Next, give the ideas a name and combine it with a product description. The name and 
idea are separated by a colon and followed by a description. The idea should be 
expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 words. Do this step by step! 
Note that on some runs, the model did not properly follow the second step and deemed the 
ideas bold enough without modification. These runs have been removed from the final 
aggregation (around ~15% of all runs). 
The results show that the difference in cosine similarity persists from the start up until around 
750 ideas when the difference becomes negligible. It is strongest between 100- 500 ideas. After 
around 750-800 ideas the significant advantage of CoT can no longer be observed as the 
strategy starts to deplete the pool of ideas it can generate from. In other words, there are fewer 
and fewer fish in the pond and the strategy does not matter any more. 
This is illustrated in Figure 3. On the x-axis, the Figure displays how many ideas already have 
been generated. On the y-axis, we show the cosine similarity of a new idea in comparison to the 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708466 
existing ones. Figure 3 suggests diminishing returns, i.e., we are removing more and more ���fish��� 
from the pond. The higher initial similarity might be caused by lower entropy at the start which 
increases after a number of ideas have been generated. 
To account for minor differences in overall idea count, the graph below only shows the first 1000 
per strategy. The graph is smoothed by using exponential smoothing with an alpha of 0.5.
Nuspeak Translator
The "Exhaustion" section of the paper discusses an analysis conducted to evaluate how the Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy compares to the base strategy in terms of idea generation over an extended period. This comparison aims to understand at what point these strategies begin to exhaust their capacity to generate unique ideas.
Methodology and Prompts:
Prompts Used
:
Base Prompt
: A standard prompt asking for new product ideas targeting college students in the United States, with specific requirements such as being a physical good under USD 50.
Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompt
: A more detailed prompt guiding the AI through several steps to ensure the generation of different and bold ideas, along with naming and describing each product.
Analysis of Idea Generation
:
Up to 1200 ideas were generated in one session for each strategy. The analysis observed the rate at which the ideas generated began to repeat or lose their uniqueness.
Key Findings:
Persistence of Cosine Similarity Difference
:
The difference in cosine similarity between the CoT and base strategies persisted up to around 750 ideas, after which it became negligible. The CoT strategy's advantage was most pronounced between 100-500 ideas.
Exhaustion of Idea Pool
:
After approximately 750-800 ideas, the significant advantage of the CoT strategy diminished, indicating that the pool of unique ideas available to the model was becoming depleted.
Diminishing Returns
:
As more ideas were generated, there were diminishing returns, akin to removing more "fish" from the pond. The initial higher similarity in ideas might be due to lower entropy at the start, which increased as more ideas were generated.
Graphical Representation
:
Figure 3 illustrates these findings, showing the number of ideas generated on the x-axis and the cosine similarity of each new idea compared to existing ones on the y-axis. Exponential smoothing with an alpha of 0.5 was used for the graph.
Implications of the Results:
This analysis provides insight into the capacity of different AI prompting strategies to generate unique ideas over an extended period.
The CoT strategy demonstrates a stronger performance in maintaining idea diversity for a longer sequence of idea generation, although its advantage diminishes as the idea pool becomes exhausted.
These findings underscore the importance of prompt design in maximizing the creative potential of AI models like GPT-4, especially in tasks that require sustained generation of novel ideas.
You
See if you can simplify that a bit and give some analogies.
Nuspeak Translator
Sure, let's simplify the "Exhaustion" section with an analogy:
Imagine you're fishing in a pond filled with different kinds of fish, each fish representing a unique idea. In this study, two fishing methods (or strategies) are compared: the standard fishing method (Base Prompt) and a more advanced technique (Chain of Thought, or CoT).
Base Prompt (Standard Fishing Method)
:
This is like using a basic fishing rod. You can catch fish, but you might start catching the same types of fish after a while. The variety of fish (ideas) you catch is less.
Chain of Thought (Advanced Fishing Technique)
:
This is like using a specialized fishing net designed to catch a wider variety of fish. Initially, you catch many different types of fish, showing that this method is more effective at finding a diverse range of fish (ideas).
Exhaustion of the Pond
:
However, no matter how good your fishing method is, there's a limit to how many different types of fish are in the pond. After catching fish for a long time (generating lots of ideas), you start to see the same types again, both with the basic rod and the specialized net. This is like the idea pool becoming exhausted ��� after around 750-800 ideas, even the CoT strategy can't find as many new fish (unique ideas).
Measuring the Catch (Cosine Similarity)
:
Think of cosine similarity as a way to measure how similar each new fish you catch is to the ones you've already caught. The lower the score, the more unique the fish is. Initially, CoT catches more unique fish, but eventually, the difference in the catch between the two methods becomes less noticeable.
In summary, both methods are effective at catching fish (generating ideas), but the advanced CoT strategy initially catches a more diverse range of fish. However, as the pond���s variety of fish diminishes, the effectiveness of both methods in catching new types of fish becomes similar.

Figure 3: Cosine similarity between base prompt and Chain of Thought over 1000 ideas 
Based on the number of unique ideas in the respective populations, we estimate the average 
size of the opportunity space for our base prompt is around 3700 ideas with 13.8% of ideas 
being repetitive. For Chain of Thought it is around 4700 with around 11.7% of ideas considered 
the same. 
Overlap of initial ideas 
Given the observed but shrinking variance within pools over time, the question emerges 
whether ideas in pools differ or whether similar ideas are being generated each time. If the ideas 
between pools are different, an attractive option might involve combining multiple strategies and 
picking the most diverse ideas. Figure 4 below suggests that the overlap between ideas from 
multiple strategies is small. Only the first 50 ideas in each of the strategies��� pools were 
considered to allow for initial lower entropy effects to be more visible.

Figure 4: Cosine similarity between ideas from different strategies (between-pools) 
This suggests that indeed the hybrid practice of running multiple strategies and combining their 
ideas is a good option. The most common ideas can be found in Appendix B. 
Limitations 
While we feel that our findings convincingly demonstrate the potential for LLM���s to augment and 
even automate the process of idea generation, we do want to be careful not to claim more than 
what is supported by the design of our study and the data it produced. In this section, we will 
discuss two types of limitations to our research, methodological concerns and limitations to our 
study���s generalizability. 
On the methodological side, we have to acknowledge that the design, execution, and analysis of 
our study can be criticized along a number of dimensions. In particular, we see the following 
types of limitations: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708466 
-Cosine similarity is a commonly used measure of idea similarity, yet it is not perfect. One 
weakness is that it does not consider the similarity to ideas that already exist in the 
world. It is also not clear how it empirically links to human scored measures of similarity. 
Future research needs to empirically connect this measure with traditional constructs 
including pairwise comparisons and idea novelty. 
-More work also needs to be done to better understand the impact of language, style, and 
text length on cosine similarity. Two ideas that are identical, yet expressed in different 
languages or with redundant information in their descriptions should in theory obtain a 
cosine similarity score of 1, which they do not get in practice. 
-For computational reasons, we are working with a limited sample size for each prompt. 
Given the stochastic nature of LLMs, some of our results might be driven by statistical 
noise. 
-Diversity can be obtained by sacrificing idea quality. There exist countless ideas that 
have no real user need or that are obviously infeasible (a pill that makes college 
students healthy, good looking, and smart). We focus on diversity as an end goal. Future 
research needs to show that this diversity indeed leads to a better best idea. 
-Our ���team human��� was represented as an aggregation of ideas working individually. This 
method is likely to have created a much more diverse idea pool than any human 
individual or brainstorming team would have been capable of producing. 
We also want to be careful not to generalize our results beyond what we have presented. Our 
findings might be GPT-4 specific. Moreover, other idea domains than the one considered here 
are likely to lead to another ranking of the prompting strategies shown in Table 2. Nevertheless, 
we believe that CoT has a fundamental advantage. Yet, specific personas might or might not change if we used another LLM.

In this section, the paper presents findings on idea generation using different strategies and discusses the limitations of the study.
Key Findings:
Opportunity Space Size
:
The average size of the opportunity space (number of unique ideas) for the base prompt is estimated to be around 3700 ideas, with 13.8% of ideas being repetitive. For the Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy, it's around 4700 ideas, with about 11.7% considered the same.
Overlap of Initial Ideas
:
Despite the variance in ideas shrinking over time, the study finds that ideas from different pools (strategies) tend to be distinct. This is suggested by the small overlap between ideas generated by different strategies, indicating the potential effectiveness of a hybrid approach that combines ideas from multiple strategies.
Hybrid Strategy Potential
:
The hybrid approach of using multiple strategies and selecting the most diverse ideas seems promising. This approach could leverage the unique strengths of each strategy to generate a wide range of innovative ideas.
Limitations of the Study:
Cosine Similarity as a Measure
:
While commonly used, cosine similarity is not perfect. It doesn't account for similarity to existing ideas in the world and its empirical link to human-scored measures of similarity is unclear. Further research is needed to connect this measure with traditional constructs like pairwise comparisons and idea novelty.
Impact of Language and Text Length
:
The influence of language style and text length on cosine similarity needs more exploration. Identical ideas expressed differently may not score a perfect similarity, indicating a potential area for refinement.
Sample Size and Stochastic Nature of LLMs
:
The limited sample size for each prompt, given computational constraints, and the stochastic nature of LLMs, suggest that some results might be influenced by statistical noise.
Trade-off Between Diversity and Idea Quality
:
Focusing solely on diversity might lead to the generation of impractical or irrelevant ideas. Future research should explore how this diversity translates into higher quality or more feasible ideas.
Generalizability of Findings
:
The study cautions against generalizing the findings beyond the scope of the research. The results might be specific to GPT-4 and the particular idea domain studied. The ranking of prompting strategies and their effectiveness might vary in other contexts or with different LLMs.
Conclusion:
The study's findings indicate that while strategies like CoT can significantly enhance the diversity of AI-generated ideas, there are limitations and considerations in the methodology and the interpretation of results. The potential of a hybrid strategy combining multiple approaches is a notable insight, offering a promising direction for future research and application in idea generation using AI. However, the study also highlights the need for careful consideration of the trade-offs between idea diversity and quality, and the importance of contextualizing findings within the specific characteristics of the AI model and the domain of application.

Implications and Conclusion 
Our results have strong implications for anyone who wants to use LLMs for augmenting human 
idea generation. 
First, we confirm our hypothesis that generative AI currently produces less diverse ideas than a 
group of humans. By comparing the diversity of ideas generated by a whole array of different 
prompting strategies with the diversity of ideas generated by groups of humans, we find that 
humans still seem to have a slight advantage in coming up with diverse ideas compared to state 
of the art large language models and prompting. 
Second, and maybe not surprisingly, we show that prompting strategies do make a difference. 
Prompt engineering (i.e., prompting ���the right way���) dramatically increases idea diversity. 
Specifically, we find that longer and more elaborate prompts work well. This is, as hypothesized, 
especially true of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. 

Finally, we find that the overlap that is obtained from different prompts is relatively low. This 
makes hybrid prompting, i.e., generating smaller pools of ideas with different prompting 
strategies and then combining these pools, an attractive strategy. 
After manyyears of research in the field of creativity and innovation with the objective of 
teaching and managing the innovation process (Terwiesch and Ulrich 2009), the new technology 
of LLM���s now enables aspiring innovators to use our enhanced understanding of the innovation 
process to automate it. When done so with human supervision, this should allow for more, 
better, (and if prompted correctly) also more diverse ideas.

The "Implications and Conclusion" section of the paper outlines the key insights and practical implications derived from the study on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for augmenting human idea generation.
Key Implications:
Comparison with Human Idea Generation
:
The study confirms that, as of now, generative AI (like GPT-4) tends to produce less diverse ideas compared to groups of humans. Although AI and advanced prompting techniques have made significant strides, humans still hold a slight edge in generating a wider variety of ideas.
Impact of Prompting Strategies
:
The research clearly demonstrates that the way AI is prompted can significantly affect the diversity of the ideas it generates. Prompt engineering, or the practice of crafting prompts effectively, plays a crucial role in enhancing idea diversity. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, in particular, stands out as an effective method for generating more diverse ideas.
Benefits of Hybrid Prompting
:
The study finds that the overlap between ideas generated from different prompts is relatively low. This suggests that a hybrid approach ��� combining smaller pools of ideas generated using various prompting strategies ��� is a viable and effective method. Such an approach can harness the unique strengths of each prompting strategy to produce a broader range of innovative ideas.
Conclusion and Future Outlook:
The findings from this research offer valuable guidance for those looking to use LLMs in the field of creativity and innovation. With careful prompt engineering and potentially using a hybrid prompting strategy, LLMs can significantly augment human creativity, leading to the generation of more, better, and more diverse ideas.
The study also points towards the potential of LLMs to automate aspects of the innovation process, especially when guided by human supervision. This could revolutionize the field of creativity and innovation, making it more accessible and efficient.
Overall, the paper concludes that while LLMs like GPT-4 have not yet surpassed human creativity in terms of idea diversity, they hold considerable potential as tools for enhancing and streamlining the creative process. With strategic use and continuous advancements in AI technology, LLMs could become integral to the future of innovation and creative problem-solving.
You
Boring Person0.38310x100You are the most boring person alive asked to 
generate new product ideas. The product will target 
college students in the United States. It should be a 
physical good, not a service or software. I'd like a 
product that could be sold at a retail price of less than 
about USD 50. The ideas are just ideas. The product 
need not yet exist, nor may it necessarily be clearly 
feasible. Number all ideas and give them a name. The name and idea are separated by a colon. Please 
generate 100 ideas as 100 separate paragraphs. The 
idea should be expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 
words.
Nuspeak Translator
The "Boring Person" strategy mentioned here is an interesting example of prompt engineering used in the study to assess the diversity of ideas generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4.
Key Aspects of the "Boring Person" Prompt:
Persona-Based Prompting
: This strategy involves instructing the AI to assume the persona of "the most boring person alive" while generating product ideas. This kind of persona-based prompting is designed to explore how adopting different characters or mindsets by the AI might influence the creativity and diversity of its outputs.
Specific Requirements
: The prompt includes detailed requirements for the product ideas:
Target Audience: College students in the United States.
Type of Product: A physical good (excluding services or software).
Price Range: Retail price should be less than about USD 50.
Feasibility: Ideas need not be currently feasible or existing.
Structure of Output
: The AI is instructed to generate 100 ideas, each presented as a separate paragraph, with each idea having a name followed by a description. The description should be 40-80 words long.
Cosine Similarity Score
: The strategy achieved a cosine similarity score of 0.383 over 10 sessions of generating 100 ideas each. This score indicates the level of diversity in the ideas ��� the lower the score, the more diverse the ideas are.
Implications of the Strategy:
The use of a unique and somewhat counterintuitive persona like "the most boring person alive" for prompting is a creative approach to test the AI's capability in generating diverse ideas under specific constraints or perspectives.
The score of 0.383 suggests a moderate level of diversity in the ideas generated under this strategy. It provides insights into how adopting different personas can impact the AI���s creative process.
Such strategies contribute to understanding the extent to which AI can simulate human-like creativity and the role of imaginative and unconventional prompts in enhancing idea generation.
Overall, this approach exemplifies the innovative use of prompt engineering in AI research, particularly in exploring creative and diverse idea generation for specific markets and product criteria.
