Software Galaxies Documentation
Software Galaxies visualizes dependencies among most popular package managers. Every star in this visualization represents a package.

What do I see here?
Go packages

Every dot here is a package. Position of a package is determined by force based graph layout algorithm and usually clusters together packages that depend on each other.

Some packages are connected by lines. It means one package depend on another. Image above shows only very close connections. We can also see all connections, but the image becomes obscure by amount of connections.

Go packages with edges

The size of the dots represents total number of dependents. The bigger the star - the more packages are using it.

Navigating in the space
The primary focus of these visualizations is exploratory discovery. It works best on large monitor, but also works on mobile devices. Use one finger touch to fly forward, two fingers touch to fly backward. Rotate your device to look around. Click on the image below to see a video demo:

Mobile Navigation in Software Galaxies 

If you are on the desktop, you can use mouse wheel to bring up keyboard map:

W	Move forward	Up	Rotate up
S	Move backward	Down	Rotate down
A	Move left	Left	Rotate left
D	Move right	Right	Rotate right
Q	Roll right	R	Fly up
E	Roll left	F	Fly down
L	Toggle links	Space	Toggle steering
Shift	Fly faster		
I personally prefer to fly with steering mode on (spacebar activates it). In this mode the spaceship will follow your mouse cursor:

Steering mode

With this keyboard navigation you can fly far far away.

About connections
I mentioned above that some packages are rendered with links. But why don't we render them all? It's because we will see a beautiful hairball monster, which is nice, but obscures the galaxy very much:

All links

You can also toggle the links display (using L key):

no links

But then we will loose sight of smaller communities. Thus by default I'm showing only links whose length is shorter than 150 pixels:

some links

The minimal length of visible links is controlled by ml query string argument (need to open in new tab with updated value to see the result). This will be changed in future versions of the Software Galaxies Explorer.

Searching
Search box can be used to locate a start in the graph. The input box accepts regular expression: If you type . it will match all names, and show all results.

Unfortunately for larger graphs (with more than 1,000,000 nodes) this may result in terrible performance and should be improved in the future.

Found a bug? Have a suggestion? Feature Requests?
I need your help very much! Please, open a new issue if you have a suggestion, feature request or found a bug.

I wish you joyful exploration, Commander!

It sounds like you're interested in the project "pm" by anvaka which visualizes dependencies among popular package managers in a galaxy-like structure. You also mentioned that you want to reverse engineer the video game Descent (1995) and integrate it into this visualization system.
Reverse engineering a video game is a complicated task and requires good understanding of both the original game's platform and the language it was written in, as well as the system you want to port it to.
To integrate Descent into the "pm" project, you might want to consider the following steps:
Reverse Engineering Descent
: Descent was originally written in C and assembly for DOS, so you'll need tools and skills related to these languages and platform. You'll also need to understand the file formats used by the game, as well as any proprietary algorithms or data structures. You might also need to deal with legal issues related to reverse engineering, depending on your jurisdiction and the specific circumstances.
Understanding the "pm" Project
: You'll need to understand how the "pm" project works. It seems to be based on JavaScript and WebGL, so you'll need to be familiar with these technologies. You'll also need to understand how it represents and visualizes data.
Mapping Descent Data to "pm"
: Once you've reverse engineered Descent and understood "pm", you'll need to find a way to represent Descent's data in a way that "pm" can visualize. This could involve creating a custom "package manager" for Descent's data, or transforming Descent's data into a format that one of the existing package managers supported by "pm" can use.
Adapting "pm" to Handle Descent Data
: You may need to modify "pm" to handle the Descent data properly. This could involve changes to the visualization, the data loading, or other parts of the system.
Testing and Debugging
: Once you have a basic integration working, you'll need to test it thoroughly and fix any problems that arise. This could involve debugging problems with the reverse engineering, the data mapping, or the "pm" modifications.
Please note that this is a high-level overview and the actual process may be more complicated depending on the specific details of the Descent game and the "pm" project. This is a complex project that requires a wide range of skills and knowledge, and it may be a good idea to seek help from others with expertise in these areas.

And also reverse engineer this game and make it 3d, then integrate with Descent:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars!#Gameplay

Starting with a small fleet of ships and one or two planets, players develop their empires, meet other races and conquer the galaxy. Stars! games begin with race design, choosing one of 10 primary racial traits, a selection of lesser racial traits, habitability, growth, economic, and technology settings.[3] The graphics are entirely 2D, and consist of the main map view and static pictures of planets, ship hulls and components. Battles consist of moving static icons around a grid. Because of the high level of micromanagement and diplomacy requirements, many games take place over months between players spread across the galaxy.

Players initially send scouts out to scan for suitable planets which later may be colonized and developed, enlarging the player's empire and providing additional resources. As a player's empire expands the player must balance the management of the population, minerals, research, and ship/infrastructure constructions. When other players' races are encountered, a variety of diplomacy options allow for alliances, trading mineral resources
or technology, large-scale wars, and even the destruction of other races. If the random events game option is enabled, players will have to contend with (or take advantage of) the Mystery Trader, comet strikes, wormholes, and environmental changes.

Transforming the 2D game Stars! into a 3D environment and integrating it with Descent would be an ambitious and complex project. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you might need to take:
Reverse Engineering Stars!
: As with Descent, you'll first need to reverse engineer the Stars! game. You'll need to understand its gameplay mechanics, its data structures, and any proprietary algorithms or file formats it uses. Since Stars! is also an old DOS game, you'll need tools and skills related to DOS, C, and assembly programming.
Creating a 3D Version of Stars!
: Once you understand how Stars! works, you'll need to create a 3D version of it. This could involve creating 3D models for the ships, planets, and other game elements, as well as developing a 3D game engine or adapting an existing one. You'll also need to adapt the game's mechanics to work in a 3D environment.
Integrating Stars! with Descent
: Once you have a 3D version of Stars!, you'll need to integrate it with Descent. This could involve creating common data structures or interfaces that both games can use, merging the game engines, or otherwise finding ways to make the two games work together.
Adapting the "pm" Project
: As with Descent, you'll also need to adapt the "pm" project to handle the Stars! data. This could involve changes to the visualization, the data loading, or other parts of the system.
Testing and Debugging
: Finally, you'll need to test the integrated system thoroughly and fix any problems that arise. This could involve debugging problems with the reverse engineering, the 3D conversion, the game integration, or the "pm" modifications.
Please note that this is a high-level overview and the actual process could be more complicated depending on the specific details of the games and the "pm" project. This is a complex project that requires a wide range of skills and knowledge, and it may be a good idea to seek help from others with expertise in these areas.
In addition to the technical challenges, you should also be aware of potential legal issues. Reverse engineering and modifying games could potentially violate copyright laws or the game's End User License Agreement (EULA), so you should consult with a legal expert before proceeding.

Thank you very much. Give an overview of the games three minerals.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Stars! is a turn-based strategy game that centers around the management of an interstellar empire. In the game, there are three key minerals that are critical to your empire's growth and advancement. These minerals are:
Ironium
: This is essentially the "steel" of the Stars! universe. It's used in the construction of ships, factories, and mines. It's the most commonly required mineral for ship construction.
Boranium
: This is used in the construction of defenses, mines, and factories. It's also used in creating some advanced ship components. It's generally found in lesser quantities on planets compared to Ironium.
Germanium
: This is the "high-tech" mineral, used for advanced components and research. It's essential for the development of advanced technologies and the construction of more sophisticated ship components. It's typically the least common mineral, making it a valuable commodity.
These minerals are found on habitable planets and can be mined using your population or automated mines. The amount and ratio of these minerals on a planet can greatly influence its value and strategic importance.
In addition to these minerals, Stars! also has a resource called "resources" or "resource units" (RUs) which represents the overall productivity of a planet. Resources are produced by the population and are used to construct ships, factories, defenses, and to perform research. The amount of resources a planet can produce is influenced by the planet's population, the population's happiness, and the availability of minerals.
It's worth noting that the management of these minerals and resources is a key part of the strategy in Stars!. A player must carefully balance their mining operations, population growth, and technological development to ensure they have the resources they need to expand their empire and defend against other players.
