The Faustian Offer
Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. The devil
says: ���I will give you this powerful machine, and it will answer any
question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up
geometry and you will have this marvellous machine.��� . . . the danger
to our soul is there, because when you pass over into algebraic calculation, essentially you stop thinking: you stop thinking geometrically,
you stop thinking about the meaning.
Sir Michael Atiyah1
���Differential Geometry��� contains the word ���Geometry.���
A tautology? Well, the undergraduate who first opens up the assigned textbook on the subject may care to disagree! In place of geometry, our hapless student is instead confronted with a
profusion of formulas, and their proofs consist of lengthy and opaque computations. Adding insult
to injury, these computations are frequently ugly, involving a ���debauch of indices���2���a phrase
coined by ��lie Cartan (one of the principal heroes of our drama) in 1928. If the student is honest
and brave, the professor may be forced to confront an embarrassingly blunt question: ���Where has
the geometry gone?!���
Now, truth be told, most modern texts do in fact contain many pictures, usually of computergenerated curves and surfaces. But, with few exceptions, these pictures are of specific, concrete
examples, which merely illustrate theorems whose proofs rest entirely upon symbolic manipulation. In and of themselves, these pictures explain nothing!
The present book has two distinct and equally ambitious objectives, the first of which is the
subject of the first four Acts���to put the ���Geometry��� back into introductory ���Differential Geometry.��� The 235 hand-drawn diagrams contained in the pages that follow are qualitatively and
fundamentally of a different character than mere computer-generated examples. They are the conceptual fruits of many years of intermittent but intense effort���they are the visual embodiment of
intuitive geometric explanations of stunning geometric facts.
The words I wrote in the Preface to VCA3 apply equally well now: ���A significant proportion
of the geometric observations and arguments contained in this book are, to the best of my knowledge, new. I have not drawn attention to this in the text itself as this would have served no useful
purpose: students don���t need to know, and experts will know without being told. However, in
cases where an idea is clearly unusual but I am aware of it having been published by someone
else, I have tried to give credit where credit is due.��� In addition, I have attributed exercises that
appear to be original, but that are not of my making.
On a personal note (but with a serious mathematical point to follow), the roots of the
present endeavour can be traced back decades, to my youth. The story amounts to a tale of two
books.
1Mathematics in the 20th Century (Shenitzer & Stillwell, 2002, p. 6)
2The full quotation begins to reveal Cartan���s heroic stature: ���The utility of the absolute differential calculus of Ricci and LeviCivita must be tempered by an avoidance of excessively formal calculations, where the debauch of indices disguises an often
very simple geometric reality. It is this reality that I have sought to reveal.��� (From the preface to Cartan 1928.)
3Given the frequency with which I shall have occasion to refer back to my first book, Visual Complex Analysis (Needham 1997),
I shall adopt the compact conceit of referring to it simply as VCA.

xviii ��� Prologue
The first book ignited my profound fascination with Differential Geometry and with Einstein���s
General Theory of Relativity. Perhaps the experience was so intense because it was my first love;
I was 19 years old. One day, at the end of my first year of studying physics at Merton College,
Oxford, I stumbled upon a colossal black book in the bowels of Blackwell���s bookshop. Though I
did not know it then, the 1,217-page tome was euphemistically referred to by relativity theorists
as ���The Bible.��� Perhaps it is appropriate, then, that this remarkable work altered the entire course
of my life. Had I not read Gravitation (Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler 1973), I would never have had
the opportunity4
to study under (and become lifelong friends with) Roger Penrose, who in turn
fundamentally transformed my understanding of mathematics and of physics.

The passage you've shared dives deep into the philosophical and educational conflicts between algebra and geometry in the context of mathematical education, particularly in differential geometry. It reflects on the abstract nature of modern mathematical texts that often favor algebraic manipulations over intuitive geometric understanding. This critique is encapsulated in the notion that algebra offers a powerful, yet potentially soulless, computational tool, as opposed to the more visually and conceptually rich field of geometry.
The author passionately argues for a return to a more geometrically intuitive approach within differential geometry. This approach is characterized by the use of hand-drawn diagrams, which are seen not just as mere illustrations but as fundamental to understanding and discovering geometric truths. The narrative also touches on the personal journey of the author, linking their educational experiences and influences to their pedagogical choices in writing their book.
This reflection underscores a broader debate in mathematical education about the balance between computational efficiency and conceptual understanding, advocating for a blend that respects and utilizes the strengths of both algebraic and geometric methods.

In the summer of 1982, having been intrigued by the mathematical glimpses contained in
Westfall���s (1980) excellent biography of Newton, I made an intense study of Newton���s (1687) masterpiece, Philosoph�� Naturalis Principia Mathematica, usually referred to simply as the Principia.
This was the second book that fundamentally altered my life. While V. I. Arnol���d5 and S. Chandrasekhar (1995) sought to lay bare the remarkable nature of Newton���s results in the Principia, the
present book instead arose out of a fascination with Newton���s methods.
As we have discussed elsewhere,6 Newtonian scholars have painstakingly dismantled the
pernicious myth7
that the results in the 1687 Principia were first derived by Newton using his
original 1665 version of the calculus, and only later recast into the geometrical form that we find
in the finished work.
Instead, it is now understood that by the mid-1670s, having studied Apollonius, Pappus, and
Huygens, in particular, the mature Newton became disenchanted with the form in which he had
originally discovered the calculus in his youth���which is different again from the Leibnizian form
we all learn in college today���and had instead embraced purely geometrical methods.
Thus it came to pass that by the 1680s Newton���s algebraic infatuation with power series gave
way to a new form of calculus���what he called the ���synthetic method of fluxions���8���in which
the geometry of the Ancients was transmogrified and reanimated by its application to shrinking
geometrical figures in their moment of vanishing. This is the potent but nonalgorithmic form of
calculus that we find in full flower in his great Principia of 1687.
Just as I did in VCA, I now wish to take full advantage of Newton���s approach throughout
this book. Let me therefore immediately spell it out, and in significantly greater detail than I did
in VCA, in the vain hope that this second book may inspire more mathematicians and physicists
to adopt Newton���s intuitive (yet rigorous9
) methods than did my first.
If two quantities A and B depend on a small quantity ��, and their ratio approaches unity as
�� approaches zero, then we shall avoid the more cumbersome language of limits by following
Newton���s precedent in the Principia, saying simply that, ���A is ultimately equal to B.��� Also, as we
did in earlier works (Needham 1993, 2014), we shall employ the symbol ��� to denote this concept
of ultimate equality.10 In short,

The passage describes a profound personal and scholarly journey into Isaac Newton's
Philosophi�� Naturalis Principia Mathematica
("Principia"). This journey reflects not just a fascination with Newton���s results, but more so with the methodologies he employed, which diverged significantly from the more familiar calculus methods taught today.
Newton, having been influenced by the geometrical works of Apollonius, Pappus, and Huygens, shifted from his early engagement with algebraic methods (specifically power series) to a more geometrically focused approach in calculus, which he termed the ���synthetic method of fluxions.��� This method eschews algorithmic calculation in favor of a conceptual understanding of geometry, focusing on the behavior of geometrical figures as they approach vanishing points.
In an attempt to embrace and propagate Newton's methodologies, the author adopts a similar approach in their own work, deliberately avoiding modern calculus terminology like limits and instead using Newton's own concept of ���ultimate equality.��� This concept simplifies the relationship between two quantities that approach a ratio of unity as a third quantity approaches zero, by stating that one quantity is ultimately equal to the other, denoted by the symbol ���. This approach is intended to mirror Newton���s original intentions and methodologies, making them accessible and appealing to a contemporary audience of mathematicians and physicists.
This discourse highlights an ongoing dialogue within the mathematical community about the importance of methodological diversity and the historical understanding of mathematical development, advocating for a blend of historical insight and modern technique in the teaching and application of mathematical concepts.

It follows [exercise] from the theorems on limits that ultimate equality is an equivalence relation,
and that it also inherits additional properties of ordinary equality, e.g., X ��� Y & P ��� Q ��� X �� P ���
Y �� Q, and A ��� B �� C ��� (A/B) ��� C.
Before we begin to apply this idea in earnest, we also note that the jurisdiction of ultimate
equality can be extended naturally to things other than numbers, enabling one to say, for example,
that two triangles are ���ultimately similar,��� meaning that their angles are ultimately equal.
Having grasped Newton���s method, I immediately tried my own hand at using it to simplify my teaching of introductory calculus, only later realizing how I might apply it to Complex
Analysis (in VCA), and now to Differential Geometry. Though I might choose any number of
simple, illustrative examples (see Needham 1993 for more), I will reuse the specific one I gave in
the preface to VCA, and for one simple reason: this time I will use the ��� ��� ������notation to present
the argument rigorously, whereas in VCA I did not. Indeed, this example may be viewed as a
recipe for transforming most of VCA���s ���explanations��� into ���proofs,���11 merely by sprinkling on the

The passage you've shared dives into a nuanced application of Isaac Newton���s geometrical method of calculus, particularly using the concept of "ultimate equality" to derive mathematical results. Here, the method is applied to prove a derivative in calculus, providing an elegant illustration of how ultimate equality can be used to convert intuitive geometric reasoning into rigorous mathematical proofs.
Context and Application:
The author introduces the concept of ultimate equality as an equivalence relation that shares properties with ordinary equality. This is used to bridge the gap between intuitive geometrical reasoning and formal algebraic proofs, emphasizing that the relation can extend beyond numerical quantities to geometric forms, such as stating that two triangles are "ultimately similar" if their angles are ultimately equal.

This approach, using ultimate equality, shifts the focus from strict algebraic manipulation to a more intuitive, geometric understanding. This example not only highlights the simplicity and elegance of Newton's methods but also demonstrates how traditional calculus concepts can be taught through geometry, revitalizing interest in historical mathematical methods. The author���s goal is clearly to inspire a deeper appreciation for Newton���s original methodologies and encourage their application in modern contexts such as teaching and research in complex analysis and differential geometry.

So far as I know, Newton never wrote down this specific example, but compare the illuminating directness of his style12 of geometrical reasoning with the unilluminating computations we
teach our students today, more than three centuries later! As Newton himself put it,13 the geometric method is to be preferred by virtue of the ���clarity and brevity of the reasoning involved and
because of the simplicity of the conclusions and the illustrations required.��� Indeed, Newton went
even further, resolving that only the synthetic method was ���worthy of public utterance.���
11I was already using the ��� notation (both privately and in print) at the time of writing VCA, and, in hindsight, it was
a mistake that I did not employ it in that work; this led some to suppose that the arguments presented in VCA were less
rigorous than they actually were (and remain).
12The best ambassador for Newton���s approach will be you yourself. We therefore suggest that you immediately try your own
hand at Newtonian reasoning, by doing Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 4, on page 24.

xx ��� Prologue
Newton himself did not employ any symbol to represent his concept of ���ultimate equality.���
Instead, his devotion to the geometrical method of the Ancients spilled over into emulating their
mode of expression, causing him to write out the words ���ultimately have the ratio of equality,���
every single time the concept was invoked in a proof. As Newton (1687, p. 124) explained, the Principia is ���written in words at length in the manner of the Ancients.��� Even when Newton claimed
that two ratios were ultimately equal, he insisted on expressing each ratio in words. As a result, I
myself was quite unable to follow Newton���s reasoning without first transcribing and summarizing each of his paragraphs into ���modern��� form (which was in fact already quite common in 1687).
Indeed, back in 1982, this was the catalyst for my private introduction and use of the symbol, ��� .
It is my view that Newton���s choice not to introduce a symbol for ���ultimate equality��� was a
tragically consequential error for the development of mathematics. As Leibniz���s symbolic calculus swept the world, Newton���s more penetrating geometrical method fell by the wayside. In the
intervening centuries only a handful of people ever sought to repair this damage and revive Newton���s approach, the most notable and distinguished recent champion having been V. I. Arnol���d14
(1937���2010).
Had Newton shed the trappings of this ancient mode of exposition and instead employed
some symbol (any symbol!) in place of the words ���ultimately equal,��� his dense, paragraph-length
proofs in the Principia might have been reduced to a few succinct lines, and his mode of thought
might still be widely employed today. Both VCA and this book are attempts to demonstrate, very
concretely, the continuing relevance and vitality of Newton���s geometrical approach, in areas of
mathematics whose discovery lay a century in the future at the time of his death in 1727.
Allow me to insert some fine print concerning my use of the words ���rigour��� and ���proof.���
Yes, my explicit use of Newtonian ultimate equalities in this work represents a quantum jump
in rigour, as compared to my exposition in VCA, but there will be some mathematicians who
will object (with justification!) that even this increase in rigour is insufficient, and that none of the
���proofs��� in this work are worthy of that title, including the one just given: I did not actually prove
that the side of the triangle is ultimately equal to the arc of the circle.
ChatGPT
The passage discusses the historical context and educational impact of Isaac Newton's preference for a purely geometrical method of reasoning, which contrasts sharply with the algebraic methods that dominate modern mathematical education. The author reflects on the implications of Newton���s choice not to use symbols for representing concepts like "ultimate equality," which, according to the author, had significant consequences for the development and reception of Newton���s ideas.
Newton's Style and Influence:
Newton's adherence to the ancient style of geometrical reasoning involved writing out his mathematical concepts in long textual explanations without using concise mathematical symbols. This method, while true to the classical style, made his works less accessible and harder to comprehend, especially compared to the symbolic calculus developed by Leibniz, which gained broader acceptance due to its clarity and ease of use.
The Use of ��� Symbol:
The author regrets not using the ��� symbol in earlier works, noting that this omission might have led some to underestimate the rigor of the arguments presented. By adopting this symbol in later works, the author aims to enhance the clarity and rigor of the mathematical proofs, making them more accessible and understandable, mirroring the way modern mathematics typically utilizes symbols for clarity and brevity.
Historical Impact and Modern Relevance:
Newton's reluctance to depart from the ancient style was seen as a missed opportunity to make his groundbreaking ideas more palatable to a wider audience. The author suggests that had Newton employed a symbolic notation, his work might have remained more directly influential in the field. The author���s current and past works attempt to bridge this historical divide by demonstrating the relevance of Newton���s geometrical methods to contemporary mathematical topics, such as complex analysis and differential geometry.
Reflection on Rigor:
Finally, the author acknowledges a potential criticism regarding the rigor of their proofs. Despite enhancing clarity by using the symbol for ultimate equality, they recognize that some mathematicians might still find the proofs lacking, particularly in proving that certain geometric elements are ultimately equal. This candid admission highlights the ongoing challenge in balancing historical methods with the rigor expected in modern mathematical discourse.
This reflection deepens the discussion about the evolution of mathematical notation and method, emphasizing the need for clear and effective communication in mathematics to foster understanding and innovation.

I can offer no logical defence, but will merely repeat the words I wrote in the Preface of VCA,
more than two decades ago: ���My book will no doubt be flawed in many ways of which I am not
yet aware, but there is one ���sin��� that I have intentionally committed, and for which I shall not
repent: many of the arguments are not rigorous, at least as they stand. This is a serious crime if
one believes that our mathematical theories are merely elaborate mental constructs, precariously
hoisted aloft. Then rigour becomes the nerve-racking balancing act that prevents the entire structure from crashing down around us. But suppose one believes, as I do, that our mathematical
theories are attempting to capture aspects of a robust Platonic world that is not of our making.
I would then contend that an initial lack of rigour is a small price to pay if it allows the reader
to see into this world more directly and pleasurably than would otherwise be possible.��� So, to
preemptively address my critics, let me therefore concede, from the outset, that when I claim that
an assertion is ���proved,��� it may be read as, ���proved beyond a reasonable doubt���!15
Separate and apart from the issue of rigour is the sad fact that in rethinking so much classical
mathematics I have almost certainly made mistakes: The blame for all such errors is mine, and
mine alone. But please do not blame my geometrical tools for such poor craftsmanship���I am
equally capable of making mistakes when performing symbolic computations!
ChatGPT
The author of the passage takes a reflective and philosophical stance towards the rigor of mathematical proofs, particularly in the context of their own work. This perspective highlights a fundamental divide in the philosophy of mathematics regarding the nature and purpose of mathematical theories.
Philosophy of Mathematical Rigor:
The author acknowledges a deliberate choice to prioritize intuitive understanding over strict formal rigor in their mathematical arguments. This approach is based on the belief that mathematical theories are not merely constructs of the mind but rather attempts to describe a pre-existing, Platonic reality. By reducing the initial emphasis on rigor, the author aims to make these deeper truths more accessible and engaging to the reader, suggesting that this trade-off allows for a more direct and pleasurable engagement with the mathematical world.
Defense Against Criticism:
Anticipating criticism for this approach, the author argues that their proofs should be understood as "proved beyond a reasonable doubt," rather than in the strictest formal sense. This nuanced view acknowledges that while the arguments may not meet the highest standards of formal proof, they still offer substantial and convincing insights that support their conclusions.
Acceptance of Responsibility:
The author also expresses a candid acceptance of responsibility for any errors that might be found in their work. By distinguishing the potential shortcomings of their approach from the tools they employ, they emphasize that errors are a result of their execution rather than the geometric methods or philosophical approach they advocate.
This passage underscores a deeper debate within the mathematical community about the value and necessity of rigor. It highlights how different philosophical beliefs about the nature of mathematics can influence approaches to teaching, learning, and exploring mathematical concepts. In this view, mathematics is seen not just as a set of abstract rules to be rigorously proved but as a dynamic field where understanding and insight are equally important as formal precision.

The book can be fully understood without giving a second thought to the complete arc of
the unfolding drama, told as it is in five Acts. That said, I think that plot matters, and that the
book���s unorthodox structure and title are fitting, for the following reasons. First, I have sought to present the ideas as dramatically as I myself see them, not only in terms of their historical
development,16 but also (more importantly) in terms of the cascading, interconnected flow of the
ideas themselves, and their startling implications for the rest of mathematics and for physics.
Second, more by instinct than design, the role of each of the five Acts does indeed follow (more
or less) the classical structure of a Shakespearean drama; in particular, the anticipated ���Climax��� is
indeed Act III: ���Curvature.��� It was in fact years after I had begun work on the book that one day
it suddenly became clear to me that what I had been composing all along had been a mathematical
drama in five acts. That very day I ���corrected��� the title of the work, and correspondingly changed
its five former ���Parts��� into ���Acts���:
��� Act I: The Nature of Space
��� Act II: The Metric
��� Act III: Curvature
��� Act IV: Parallel Transport
��� Act V: Forms
The first four Acts fulfill the promise of a self-contained, geometrical introduction to Differential Geometry. Act IV is the true mathematical powerhouse that finally makes it possible to provide
geometric proofs of many of the assertions made in the first three Acts.
ChatGPT
The author describes the structure of their book on differential geometry as a dramatic narrative divided into five "Acts," akin to a Shakespearean play. This unconventional approach aims to reflect both the historical development and the dynamic interplay of ideas within the field. Here's a breakdown of how this structure enhances the presentation of the content and the reader's engagement with the material:
Dramatic Presentation
Historical Context
: The dramatic structure allows the author to emphasize the historical progression of ideas in differential geometry, highlighting key developments and shifts in understanding over time.
Interconnected Ideas
: By organizing the content into acts, the author can showcase how different concepts in differential geometry are interrelated, leading to a cascading flow of insights that build upon each other.
Acts as Structural Elements
Act I: The Nature of Space
: Likely sets the stage by discussing foundational concepts about the geometric nature of space itself.
Act II: The Metric
: Probably explores how distances and angles are measured within the space, introducing tools to quantify geometry.
Act III: Curvature
: Positioned as the climax, this act would delve into the curvature of space, a central concept in both mathematics and physics, especially in the study of general relativity.
Act IV: Parallel Transport
: Explores the properties of curves and surfaces through the movement of vectors along these curves, which is pivotal for understanding connections and curvature deeply.
Act V: Forms
: Likely covers differential forms, which are mathematical tools used to generalize functions, vectors, and operations like dot and cross products.
Impact on Understanding
The dramatic format aims to make the content more engaging and memorable by framing the mathematical discussions within a narrative structure that builds suspense and delivers resolutions, much like a play.
This structure is particularly effective in helping readers appreciate the significance of each concept as part of a larger story of mathematical discovery.
Educational Philosophy
The author's choice to label the parts as acts underscores their view of mathematics as not only a set of abstract theories but as a dynamic and evolving discipline that has dramatic impacts on our understanding of the universe.
It also suggests that the author sees each mathematical concept as playing a role in a broader narrative, contributing to a deeper and interconnected understanding of space, geometry, and their applications to the physical world.
This approach not only enhances the educational experience by making complex ideas more accessible and engaging but also highlights the philosophical and historical dimensions of mathematics, inviting readers to explore differential geometry as an active participant in an unfolding drama rather than as a passive observer.

Several aspects of the subject matter are as unorthodox (in a first course) as the geometrical methods by which they are treated. Here we shall describe only the three most important
examples.
First, the climax within the climax of Act III is the Global Gauss���Bonnet Theorem���a remarkable
link between local geometry and global topology. While the inclusion of this topic is standard,
our treatment of it is not. Indeed, we celebrate its centrality and fundamental importance with
an extravagant display of mathematical fireworks: we devote five chapters to it, offering up four
quite distinct proofs, each one shedding new light on the result, and on the nature of Differential
Geometry itself.
Second, the transition (usually in graduate school) from 2-dimensional surfaces to ndimensional spaces (called ���manifolds���) is often confusing and intimidating for students. Chapter 29���the second longest chapter of the book���seeks to bridge this gap by focusing (initially) on
the curvature of 3-dimensional manifolds, which can be visualized; yet we frame the discussion
so as to apply to any number of dimensions. We use this approach to provide an intuitive, geometrical, yet technically complete, introduction to the famous Riemann tensor, which measures the
curvature of an n-dimensional manifold.
Third, having committed to a full treatment of the Riemann tensor, we felt it would have
been immoral to have hidden from the reader its single greatest triumph in the arena of the natural world. We therefore conclude Act IV with a prolonged, geometrical introduction to Einstein���s
glorious General Theory of Relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature impressed upon 4-
dimensional spacetime by matter and energy. This is the third longest chapter of the book. Not
only does it treat (in complete geometrical detail) the famous Gravitational Field Equation (which
Einstein discovered in 1915) but it also explains some of the most recent and exciting discoveries
regarding its implications for black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology!
Now let us turn to Act V, which is quite different in character from the four Acts that precede
it, for it seeks to accomplish a second objective of the work, one that is quite distinct from the first,
but no less ambitious.
Even the most rabid geometrical zealot must concede that Atiyah���s diabolical machine
(described in the opening quotation) is a necessary evil; but if we must calculate, let us at least do so gracefully! Fortunately, starting in 1900, ��lie Cartan developed a powerful and elegant new
method of computation, initially to investigate Lie Groups, but later to provide a new approach to
Differential Geometry.
Cartan���s discovery is called the ���Exterior Calculus,��� and the objects it studies and differentiates and integrates are called ���Differential Forms,��� here abbreviated simply to Forms. We shall
ultimately follow Cartan���s lead, illustrating his method���s power and elegance in the final chapter
of Act V���the longest chapter of the book���reproving symbolically results that were proven geometrically in the first four Acts. But Forms will carry us beyond what was possible in the first four Acts:
in particular, they will provide a beautifully efficient method of calculating the Riemann tensor of
an n-manifold, via its curvature 2-forms.
First, however, we shall fully develop Cartan���s ideas in their own right, providing a selfcontained introduction to Forms that is completely independent of the first four Acts. Lest there be
any confusion, we repeat, the first six chapters���out of seven���of Act V make no reference whatsoever
to Differential Geometry! We have done this because Forms find fruitful applications across diverse
areas of mathematics, physics, and other disciplines. Our aim is to make Forms accessible to the widest
possible range of readers, even if their primary interest is not Differential Geometry.
To that end, we have sought to treat Forms much more intuitively and geometrically than is
customary. That said, the reader should be under no illusions: the principal purpose of Act V is
to construct, at the undergraduate level, the ���Devil���s machine������a remarkably powerful method of
computation.
The immense power of these Forms is reminiscent of the complex numbers: a tiny drop goes
in, and an ocean pours out���Cartan���s Forms explain vastly more than was asked of them by their
discoverer, a sure sign that he had hit upon Platonic Forms!

The author details a highly structured and innovative approach to teaching differential geometry in their book, which is divided into five "Acts," each serving distinct pedagogical and thematic purposes. The narrative structure not only serves to engage the reader but also reflects the interconnected and dynamic nature of the subject. Here���s a detailed breakdown of the key elements and innovations described for each Act:
Act III: Curvature
Global Gauss-Bonnet Theorem
: This Act reaches its climax with an in-depth exploration of the Global Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, which links local geometrical properties to global topological characteristics. The author���s treatment includes four distinct proofs, each illuminating different aspects of the theorem and differential geometry at large, emphasizing its central role in the field.
Transition to Higher Dimensions
Chapter 29
: This chapter aims to demystify the transition from studying 2-dimensional surfaces to n-dimensional manifolds, a jump that often occurs at the graduate level and can be daunting for students. By initially focusing on the more visually accessible 3-dimensional manifolds, the author provides an intuitive yet technically thorough introduction to the Riemann tensor, a key concept for understanding manifold curvature in any number of dimensions.
Act IV: General Theory of Relativity
Einstein's Theory
: The Act concludes with a comprehensive introduction to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, describing gravity as the curvature of 4-dimensional spacetime. This chapter not only explains the foundational Gravitational Field Equation but also connects to current topics like black holes and gravitational waves, highlighting the profound implications of Einstein���s theory in modern physics and cosmology.
Act V: Exterior Calculus and Differential Forms
Cartan���s Exterior Calculus
: Act V shifts focus to ��lie Cartan's development of Exterior Calculus, which revolutionized the computation within differential geometry. This Act is structured to make Differential Forms accessible to a broad audience, independent of their primary interest in differential geometry, emphasizing their applications across various scientific fields.
Intuitive and Geometrical Treatment
: The approach to Forms is intentionally more intuitive and geometric than is typical, aiming to make these complex concepts accessible at an undergraduate level. The narrative culminates in the powerful computational methods enabled by Differential Forms, dramatically expanding the reader���s capability to calculate and understand geometrical and physical phenomena.
Educational Philosophy and Narrative Structure
Dramatic and Interconnected Approach
: The book's structure���modeling a Shakespearean drama���serves to underline the dramatic development of ideas and their interconnectedness, which may help students better retain and understand complex concepts through a more narrative-based learning experience.
Platonic Forms
: The final discussion about Cartan���s Forms is likened to discovering Platonic Forms, suggesting that these mathematical structures reveal underlying truths that extend far beyond their initial applications or the intentions of their creators, echoing the author's philosophical view of mathematics as a discovery of pre-existing truths rather than mere inventions.
Overall, the author's methodological and structural choices are designed to deepen understanding and appreciation of differential geometry, making advanced mathematical concepts accessible and engaging through a well-thought-out narrative and innovative teaching approaches. This approach not only educates but also inspires, by connecting historical mathematical development with modern applications and philosophical insights.

To give just one example, Forms unify and clarify all of Vector Calculus, in a way that would
be a revelation to undergraduates, if only they were permitted to see it. Indeed, Green���s Theorem,
Gauss���s Theorem, and Stokes���s Theorem are merely different manifestations of a single theorem
about Forms that is simpler than any of these special cases! Despite the indisputable importance of
Differential Forms across mathematics and physics, most undergraduates will leave college without
ever having seen them, and I have long considered this a scandal. Only a precious handful17 of
undergraduate textbooks (on either Vector Calculus or Differential Geometry) even mention their
existence, and they are instead relegated to graduate school.
This lamentable state of affairs is now well into its second century, and I see no signs of an
impending sea change. In response, Act V seeks not to curse the dark, but rather to light a candle,18
striving to convince the reader that Cartan���s Forms (and their underlying ���tensors���) are as simple
as they are beautiful, and that they (and the name Cartan!) deserve to become a standard part
of the undergraduate curriculum. This is the brazenly ambitious goal of Act V. After drowning the
reader in pure Geometry for the first four Acts, we hope that the computational aspect of this final
Act may serve as a suitably cathartic d��nouement!
ChatGPT
The author passionately advocates for integrating the study of Differential Forms into undergraduate mathematics curricula, highlighting their potential to unify and simplify concepts traditionally taught in vector calculus. This enthusiasm is rooted in the belief that Differential Forms provide a more intuitive and elegant framework for understanding mathematical relationships that are often compartmentalized in traditional education.
Unifying Power of Differential Forms
Differential Forms, as described by the author, have the ability to clarify and unify the entire scope of vector calculus. The author points out that major theorems���Green���s Theorem, Gauss���s Theorem, and Stokes���s Theorem���are essentially special cases of a broader theorem about Forms. This unification is not commonly presented in undergraduate courses, which typically separate these theorems into distinct topics without highlighting their interconnectedness through the language of Forms.
Educational Reform and Accessibility
The lack of exposure to Differential Forms at the undergraduate level is seen by the author as a significant oversight in mathematical education. By relegating these concepts to graduate studies, educational institutions miss the opportunity to provide students with a holistic and efficient framework for understanding complex mathematical ideas. The author considers this a "scandal" due to the simplicity, beauty, and utility of Forms, which can dramatically enhance a student's comprehension and appreciation of mathematics.
Act V: A Vision for Change
In Act V of the book, the author aims to illuminate this overlooked area of mathematics by providing an accessible and compelling introduction to Differential Forms. This act is designed not just to educate but to inspire a reevaluation of the standard mathematics curriculum. By framing this introduction as a "lighting of a candle" rather than "cursing the dark," the author adopts a constructive approach to educational reform. The goal is to demonstrate that these concepts are not only approachable but also fundamentally enhance the mathematical toolkit available to undergraduates.
Conclusion and Hope for Future Education
The hope is that by exposing readers to the elegance and power of Differential Forms through a detailed and passionate presentation, there will be a shift in how these topics are perceived and taught. The author���s ambitious vision for Act V is to serve as a transformative conclusion to the book, providing a cathartic culmination that moves from pure geometry into the practical power of computation in mathematics.
In summary, the author���s discussion about Differential Forms and their integration into undergraduate education reflects a deep commitment to enhancing how mathematics is taught and understood, advocating for a curriculum that is both more integrated and intuitively appealing.

Chapter 1
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
1.1 Euclidean and Hyperbolic Geometry
Differential Geometry is the application of calculus to the geometry of space that is curved. But to
understand space that is curved we shall first try to understand space that is flat.
We inhabit a natural world pervaded by curved objects, and if a child asks us the meaning of
the word ���flat,��� we are most likely to answer in terms of the absence of curvature: a smooth surface
without any bumps or hollows. Nevertheless, the very earliest mathematicians seem to have been
drawn to the singular simplicity and uniformity of the flat plane, and they were rewarded with
the discovery of startlingly beautiful facts about geometric figures constructed within it. With the
benefit of enormous hindsight, some of these facts can be seen to characterize the plane���s flatness.
[1.1] Pythagoras���s Theorem: the geometry of
3
2 + 4
2 = 5
2
.
One of the earliest and most profound
such facts to be discovered was Pythagoras���s
Theorem. Surely the ancients must have been
awed, as any sensitive person must remain
today, that a seemingly unalloyed fact about
numbers,
3
2 + 4
2 = 5
2
,
in fact has geometrical meaning, as seen in
[1.1].1
While Pythagoras himself lived in Greece
around 500 BCE, the theorem bearing his
name was discovered much earlier, in various
places around the world. The earliest known
example of such knowledge is recorded in the
Babylonian clay tablet (catalogued as ���Plimpton 322���) shown in [1.2], which was unearthed in what is now Iraq, and which dates
from about 1800 BCE.
The tablet lists Pythagorean triples:
2
integers (a, b, h) such that h is the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with sides a and b, and therefore a
2 + b
2 = h
2
. Some of these ancient examples are
impressively large, and it seems clear that they did not stumble upon them, but rather possessed
a mathematical process for generating solutions. For example, the fourth row of the tablet records
the fact that 135002 + 127092 = 185412
.

Chapter 1 of the book appears to set the stage for a comprehensive exploration of geometry, starting from the most fundamental concepts of Euclidean geometry and extending into the more complex realms of non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. Here's a breakdown of the key themes and educational approaches identified in the excerpt:
Focus on Euclidean and Hyperbolic Geometry
The chapter begins by grounding the reader in the familiar concept of Euclidean geometry���specifically the geometry of flat space���as a basis for understanding more complex geometrical structures like curved spaces. This approach is effective as it starts with the intuitive and commonplace (flatness) to gradually introduce the abstract and less familiar (curvature).
Historical Context and Mathematical Wonder
The excerpt highlights the historical discovery and significance of Pythagoras's Theorem, emphasizing its dual nature as both a numerical and geometrical truth. This serves multiple educational purposes:
Historical Insight
: By tracing the origins of Pythagorean triples back to ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, the author connects mathematical concepts to their historical development, enriching the educational experience with cultural and temporal context.
Appreciation for Mathematical Beauty
: The author���s reflection on the awe-inspiring nature of these discoveries encourages readers to appreciate the elegance and profound simplicity found in mathematical relationships.
Pythagoras���s Theorem as a Gateway
By focusing on Pythagoras's Theorem, the author uses a well-known mathematical principle to bridge everyday experiences with abstract mathematical theory. This theorem is not only foundational for understanding Euclidean geometry but also acts as a conceptual springboard into discussions of more complex geometries, such as hyperbolic geometry, which will likely be explored in the subsequent sections of the chapter.
Educational Philosophy
The choice to start with a discussion on flatness and the basic properties of plane geometry, coupled with historical anecdotes, reflects the author's educational philosophy:
Building Conceptual Foundations
: Starting with simple, familiar concepts before moving into complex areas helps establish a strong foundational understanding in readers.
Engagement Through Narrative
: Incorporating historical narratives and the broader implications of mathematical discoveries engages readers by showing the 'human' side of mathematics, making abstract concepts more relatable and memorable.
Preview of Differential Geometry
Although the excerpt does not delve into the applications of calculus to geometry directly, it sets up the expectation that these foundational geometrical insights will soon be connected to the study of differential geometry. This connection will likely explore how calculus can be used to describe and analyze the properties of curved spaces, thereby extending the discussion from the flat Euclidean planes to the curved geometries that are pervasive in both mathematics and the natural world.
Overall, Chapter 1 seems designed to ease readers into complex geometrical concepts by first solidifying their understanding of more basic geometries and illustrating the continuity of mathematical thought from ancient to modern times, setting a solid stage for deeper exploration into differential geometry.

The deeper knowledge that underlay these ancient results is not known,3 but to find the first
evidence of the ���modern,��� logical, deductive approach to mathematics we must jump 1200 years
into the future of the clay tablet. Scholars believe that it was Thales of Miletus (around 600 BCE)
who first pioneered the idea of deducing new
results from previously established ones, the
logical chain beginning at a handful of clearly
articulated assumptions, or axioms.
Leaping forward again, 300 years beyond
Thales, we find one of the most perfect exemplars of this new approach in Euclid���s Elements, dating from 300 BCE. This work sought
to bring order, clarity, and rigour to geometry
by deducing everything from just five simple
axioms, the fifth and last of which dealt with
parallel lines.
Defining two lines to be parallel if they
do not meet, Euclid���s Fifth Axiom4
is illustrated in [1.3]:
Parallel Axiom. Through any point p not on the line L there exists precisely one
line P that is parallel to L.
But the character of this axiom was more complex and less immediate than that of the first
four, and mathematicians began a long struggle to dispense with it as an assumption, instead
seeking to show that it must be a logical consequence of the first four axioms.
This tension went unresolved for the next 2000 years. As the centuries passed, many attempts
were made to prove the Parallel Axiom, and the number and intensity of these efforts reached a
crescendo in the 1700s, but all met with failure.
Yet along the way useful equivalents of the axiom emerged. For example: There exist similar
triangles of different sizes (Wallis in 1663; see Stillwell (2010)). But the very first equivalent was
already present in Euclid, and it is the one still taught to every school child: the angles in a triangle
add up to two right angles.
ChatGPT
The passage provides a compelling historical narrative of the development of formal, logical, and deductive reasoning in mathematics, particularly focusing on geometry as formalized by Euclid and the long-standing debates surrounding his Parallel Axiom. This narrative is an essential component of understanding how modern mathematics, particularly geometry, was shaped. Here's a detailed analysis:
Historical Evolution of Mathematical Thought
Thales of Miletus
: Known as one of the first to apply deductive reasoning in mathematics, Thales represents a shift from empirical observation to logical deduction, using axioms as the foundation for proving further mathematical statements. His approach marked the beginning of mathematical formalism around 600 BCE.
Euclid and His Elements
: Fast forward to around 300 BCE, Euclid's
Elements
epitomized the deductive method by organizing geometry into an axiomatic system. This work systematically deduced vast areas of geometry from just five basic axioms, demonstrating the power and elegance of formal mathematical systems.
Euclid���s Fifth Axiom and its Impact
Complexity and Controversy
: Unlike Euclid's first four axioms, which are relatively straightforward, the Fifth Axiom, which deals with parallel lines, has been historically contentious. It states that through any point not on a line, there is exactly one line parallel to the original line. This axiom's less intuitive nature sparked extensive debate and efforts to prove it as a theorem derived from the other four axioms.
Efforts to Prove the Parallel Axiom
: Over centuries, many mathematicians attempted to prove the Parallel Axiom as a logical consequence of the other axioms, but these efforts invariably failed. This ongoing struggle highlighted the axiom's unique status and led to important developments in the understanding of geometry.
Development of Non-Euclidean Geometry
Emergence of Equivalents
: While the direct proof of the Parallel Axiom was elusive, mathematicians discovered several equivalent statements that were insightful. Notable among these is the property that the sum of the angles in any triangle equals two right angles, which is dependent on the nature of parallel lines as described by the Fifth Axiom.
Impact on Modern Geometry
: The inability to derive the Fifth Axiom from the others, despite numerous attempts, eventually led to the realization that alternate geometries were possible where this axiom did not hold. This understanding was crucial for the development of non-Euclidean geometries in the 19th century, profoundly impacting the later development of mathematical physics, particularly theories of space and time.
Educational Implications
This historical account underscores the deep roots of formal reasoning in mathematics and highlights the importance of axiomatic systems in providing a foundation for logical deduction. The story of the Parallel Axiom serves as a critical lesson in the limits and power of formal systems, demonstrating how questioning and challenging assumptions can lead to significant advancements in scientific thought. The narrative is not just about the evolution of geometric thought but also about the philosophical underpinnings of mathematical inquiry and the relentless pursuit of deeper understanding. This approach aligns well with the educational philosophy of deepening understanding through historical context, as mentioned earlier in the book���s overview.

The explanation of these failures only emerged around 1830. Completing a journey that had
begun 4000 years earlier, Nikolai Lobachevsky and J��nos Bolyai independently announced the discovery of an entirely new form of geometry (now called Hyperbolic Geometry) taking place in
a new kind of plane (now called the hyperbolic plane). In this Geometry the first four Euclidean
axioms hold, but the parallel axiom does not. Instead, the following is true:
Hyperbolic Axiom. There are at least two parallel lines through p that do not
meet L.
(1.1)
[1.4] Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728���1777).
These pioneers explored the logical consequences
of this axiom, and by purely abstract reasoning
were led to a host of fascinating results within
a rich new geometry that was bizarrely different
from that of Euclid.
Many others before them, perhaps most
notably Saccheri (in 1733; see Stillwell 2010) and
Lambert (in 1766; see Stillwell 2010), had discovered some of these consequences of (1.1), but their
aim in exploring these consequences had been to
find a contradiction, which they believed would
finally prove that Euclidean Geometry to be the
One True Geometry.
Certainly Saccheri believed he had found a
clear contradiction when he published ���Euclid
Freed of Every Flaw.��� But Lambert is a much more
perplexing case, and he is perhaps an unsung hero
in this story. His results penetrated so deeply into
this new geometry that it seems impossible that
he did not at times believe in the reality of what
he was doing. Regardless of his motivation and
beliefs5
, Lambert (shown in [1.4]) was certainly the first to discover a remarkable fact6 about the
angle sum of a triangle under axiom (1.1), and his result will be central to much that follows in
Act II.
Nevertheless, Lobachevsky and Bolyai richly deserve their fame for having been the first to
recognize and fully embrace the idea that they had discovered an entirely new, consistent, nonEuclidean Geometry. But what this new geometry really meant, and what it might be useful for,
even they could not say.7
Remarkably and surprisingly, it was the Differential Geometry of curved surfaces that ultimately
resolved these questions. As we shall explain, in 1868 the Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami
finally succeeded in giving Hyperbolic Geometry a concrete interpretation, setting it upon a
firm and intuitive foundation from which it has since grown and flourished. Sadly, neither
Lobachevsky nor Bolyai lived to see this: they died in 1856 and 1860, respectively
ChatGPT
The passage captures a significant turning point in the history of geometry, chronicling the advent of hyperbolic geometry as conceptualized by Nikolai Lobachevsky and J��nos Bolyai in the 1830s. This development marked a paradigm shift from the traditional, Euclidean view of geometry, introducing a new framework where the parallel axiom does not hold, thus allowing multiple parallel lines through a single point that never meet a given line.
Key Historical Figures and Developments
Nikolai Lobachevsky and J��nos Bolyai
: Both mathematicians independently discovered hyperbolic geometry, challenging the universality of Euclidean geometry by showing that its axioms, particularly the fifth concerning parallel lines, are not absolute but relative to the geometry considered.
Hyperbolic Axiom
: This axiom stipulates that through any point not on a line, there exist at least two lines parallel to the given line that do not meet it. This contrasts starkly with Euclid���s axiom, which asserts only one such parallel line.
Previous Efforts and Saccheri
: Before Lobachevsky and Bolyai, mathematicians like Saccheri attempted to prove the parallel axiom by deriving a contradiction from its negation. Saccheri's work, ironically titled ���Euclid Freed of Every Flaw,��� sought to affirm Euclidean geometry but instead laid groundwork that would support hyperbolic principles.
Johann Heinrich Lambert
: Lambert, another precursor, explored these non-Euclidean principles deeply, particularly the implications of non-Euclidean axioms on the sum of angles in a triangle. Although Lambert aimed to prove Euclidean geometry by finding contradictions in non-Euclidean systems, his findings inadvertently supported the consistency of alternative geometrical systems.
The Significance of Hyperbolic Geometry
The initial lack of practical application or concrete interpretation for hyperbolic geometry left its significance somewhat obscure upon its introduction. Its theoretical implications were profound, however, as it demonstrated that the axioms of geometry were not universally binding but rather specific to the geometric context, leading to the broader realization that multiple geometries could coexist theoretically.
Resolution and Impact on Modern Mathematics
Eugenio Beltrami's work in 1868 provided the much-needed geometrical interpretation of hyperbolic geometry by relating it to the geometry of curved surfaces. This connection not only validated hyperbolic geometry but also integrated it into the broader mathematical world, particularly through its implications for the study of spacetime in the theory of relativity and various fields of modern physics.
Conclusion
The development of hyperbolic geometry illustrates a critical evolution in mathematical thought, showing how the questioning of established axioms can lead to the discovery of entirely new fields. This historical narrative not only enriches our understanding of geometry's development but also underscores the dynamic nature of mathematical inquiry and the interplay between abstract reasoning and concrete mathematical modeling.

This non-Euclidean Geometry had in fact already manifested itself in various branches of
mathematics throughout history, but always in disguise. Henri Poincar�� (beginning around 1882)
was the first not only to strip it of its camouflage, but also to recognize and exploit its power in such diverse areas as Complex Analysis, Differential Equations, Number Theory, and Topology. Its continued vitality and centrality in the mathematics of the 20th and twenty-first centuries is demonstrated by Thurston���s work on 3-manifolds, Wiles���s proof of Fermat���s Last
Theorem, and Perelman���s proof of the Poincar�� Conjecture (as a special case of Thurston���s
Geometrization Conjecture), to name but three examples.
In Act II we shall describe Beltrami���s breakthrough, as well as the nature of Hyperbolic Geometry, but for now we wish to explore a different, simpler kind of non-Euclidean Geometry, one
that was already known to the Ancients.
ChatGPT
The passage highlights the profound impact of non-Euclidean geometry across multiple fields of mathematics and its recognition and utilization by key figures such as Henri Poincar��. It also sets the stage for discussing specific breakthroughs and historical milestones associated with this type of geometry.
Henri Poincar��'s Contributions
Henri Poincar��, a pivotal figure in the history of mathematics, played a critical role in revealing the hidden presence of non-Euclidean geometry within various mathematical disciplines. Starting around 1882, Poincar�� began to identify and leverage non-Euclidean geometry in areas such as:
Complex Analysis
: Where the intrinsic geometry of complex mappings can exhibit non-Euclidean characteristics.
Differential Equations
: Particularly in the study of dynamic systems where phase spaces can have non-Euclidean structures.
Number Theory
: In the context of modular forms and their symmetries, which relate to non-Euclidean geometries.
Topology
: Especially in the study of topological spaces that can be modeled using non-Euclidean geometries.
Broad Impact and Modern Examples
The influence of non-Euclidean geometry continued to grow, shaping the landscape of 20th and 21st-century mathematics:
William Thurston and 3-manifolds
: Thurston's work on the topology and geometry of 3-manifolds heavily relies on non-Euclidean geometrical concepts.
Andrew Wiles and Fermat���s Last Theorem
: Wiles's proof is based on the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, indirectly linked to non-Euclidean geometry through the study of elliptic curves over complex number fields.
Grigori Perelman and the Poincar�� Conjecture
: Perelman's proof of this conjecture, a cornerstone of three-dimensional topology, utilizes Ricci flow, an idea with deep connections to the geometric structures postulated in non-Euclidean terms.
Beltrami���s Breakthrough and Hyperbolic Geometry
Eugenio Beltrami provided crucial contributions to the understanding and acceptance of hyperbolic geometry by demonstrating models where these geometrical ideas could be visualized and understood concretely. His work helped bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theories and tangible, intuitive concepts.
Transition to Further Exploration
The text transitions to prepare the reader for Act II, where Beltrami's achievements and the specifics of hyperbolic geometry will be explored in detail. However, it also teases the introduction of another simpler form of non-Euclidean geometry, known to the Ancients, suggesting a broad and varied exploration of geometry's history and applications.
This approach not only enriches the reader's understanding of the mathematical landscape but also illustrates how foundational theoretical developments can influence vast areas of mathematics, leading to major breakthroughs across disciplines. This narrative technique effectively connects historical developments with modern mathematical achievements, showcasing the dynamic and interconnected nature of the field.

Spherical Geometry
To construct a non-Euclidean Geometry we must deny the existence of a unique parallel. The
Hyperbolic Axiom assumes two or more parallels, but there is one other logical possibility���no
parallels:
Spherical Axiom. There are no lines through p that are parallel to L : every line
meets L.
(1.2)
Thus there are actually two non-Euclidean8 geometries: spherical and hyperbolic.
As the name suggests, Spherical Geometry can be realized on the surface of a sphere���
denoted S
2
in the case of the unit sphere���which we may picture as the surface of the Earth. On
this sphere, what should be the analogue of a ���straight line��� connecting two points on the surface?
Answer: the shortest route between them! But if you wish to sail or fly from London to New York,
for example, what is the shortest route?
L
p
[1.5] The great circles of S
2
intersect in pairs of
antipodal points.
The answer, already known to the ancient
mariners, is that the shortest route is an arc of
a great circle, such as the equator, obtained
by cutting the sphere with a plane passing
through its centre. In [1.5] we have chosen L to
be the equator, and it is clear that (1.2) is satisfied: every line through p meets L in a pair of
antipodal (i.e., diametrically opposite) points.
In the plane, the shortest route is also the
straightest route, and in fact the same is true on
the sphere: in a precise sense to be discussed
later, the great circle trajectory bends neither
to the right nor to the left as it traverses the
spherical surface
ChatGPT
The passage offers an introduction to spherical geometry, one of the two principal types of non-Euclidean geometry���the other being hyperbolic geometry. Here���s a detailed exploration of the concepts and implications described:
Spherical Geometry and its Foundations
Spherical Axiom
: Unlike Euclidean geometry, which posits that through any point not on a line there is exactly one parallel line, and hyperbolic geometry, which assumes at least two, spherical geometry posits no parallel lines. In spherical geometry, every line through a point intersects every other line, negating the concept of parallelism entirely.
Realization on Spherical Surfaces
: Spherical geometry is aptly demonstrated on the surface of a sphere (denoted as
S
2
S^2
S
2
for the unit sphere). This visualization helps in understanding how traditional geometric notions like lines and distances are reinterpreted on curved surfaces.
Great Circles as Geodesics
Great Circles
: In spherical geometry, the analogue to a straight line in Euclidean space is a great circle. Great circles on a sphere are the intersection of the sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere. This includes the equator and the longitudinal lines on Earth.
Shortest Routes
: The passage uses the practical example of determining the shortest route between two cities, such as London and New York, to illustrate how great circles function as geodesics (the shortest path between two points) on a sphere. This concept has real-world applications in navigation and flight path optimization, where the shortest route is also the most energy and time-efficient.
Implications and Properties
Intersecting Great Circles
: Every pair of great circles intersects at antipodal points, demonstrating the spherical axiom where no lines (great circles) are parallel because they always meet. This property is fundamental to understanding how spherical geometry differs from planar geometries in terms of parallelism and angle sum properties.
Geodesic Property
: The text notes that just as the straightest route is the shortest on a plane, the same holds for great circles on a sphere. This concept of 'straightness' in spherical geometry corresponds to the path bending neither to the right nor to the left, maintaining a constant direction relative to the surface of the sphere.
Educational and Conceptual Significance
This introduction to spherical geometry not only highlights its theoretical underpinnings but also connects these to intuitive, observable phenomena, such as navigation paths on Earth. The discussion prepares the reader for more detailed explorations of how these concepts play out mathematically and practically, particularly in terms of how they contrast with Euclidean assumptions. This sets the stage for deeper discussions on curvature, the properties of space, and their implications in physics and other sciences. Such explorations are crucial for students and enthusiasts of geometry to appreciate the diversity and applicability of geometric principles beyond the flat planes of Euclidean geometry to the curved surfaces encountered in the real world.

There are other ways of constructing the
great circles on the Earth that do not require
thinking about planes passing through the
completely inaccessible centre of the Earth.
For example, on a globe you may map out
your great circle journey by holding down one end of a piece of string on London and pulling
the string tightly over the surface so that the other end is on New York. The taut string has automatically found the shortest, straightest route���the shorter9 of the two arcs into which the
great circle through the two cities is divided by those cities.
With the analogue of straight lines now found, we can ���do geometry��� within this spherical surface. For example, given three points on the surface of the Earth, we can connect them
together with arcs of great circles to obtain a ���triangle.��� Figure [1.6] illustrates this in the case
where one vertex is located at the north pole, and the other two are on the equator.
A
[1.6] A particularly simple ���triangle���
on the sphere.
But if this non-Euclidean Spherical Geometry was
already used by ancient mariners to navigate the oceans,
and by astronomers to map the spherical night sky, what
then was so shocking and new about the non-Euclidean
geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai?
The answer is that this Spherical Geometry was
merely considered to be inherited from the Euclidean Geometry of the 3-dimensional space in which the sphere
resides. No thought was given in those times to the
sphere���s internal 2-dimensional geometry as representing
an alternative to Euclid���s plane. Not only did it violate
Euclid���s fifth axiom, it also violated a much more basic
one (Euclid���s first axiom) that we can always draw a
unique straight line connecting two points, for this fails
when the points are antipodal.
ChatGPT
The passage introduces an intuitive method for conceptualizing and constructing great circles on a sphere, such as Earth, without requiring the theoretical notion of slicing through its center with a plane. This practical approach, using a taut string to determine the shortest path between two points, leads to further exploration of spherical geometry and its implications.
Constructing Great Circles Practically
The method described, using a string on a globe, represents a tangible way for individuals to experiment with and visualize the concept of great circles without complex mathematical or geometric tools. This hands-on approach demystifies the abstract concept of great circles by demonstrating that the taut string aligns with the shortest path between two points on a sphere, effectively finding the geodesic or "straightest" route.
Spherical Triangles and Geometry
Building on the understanding of great circles, the passage explains how to form spherical triangles by connecting three points with arcs of great circles. The example provided, where one vertex is at the North Pole and the other two are on the Equator, illustrates how spherical triangles differ from their Euclidean counterparts, especially in how they can visually and conceptually challenge our understanding of standard geometric rules.
Distinction Between Spherical and Other Non-Euclidean Geometries
The passage poses a crucial question about what made the non-Euclidean geometries of Lobachevsky and Bolyai so revolutionary compared to the well-practiced spherical geometry used by mariners and astronomers:
Perception of Spherical Geometry
: Historically, spherical geometry was seen as an extension of Euclidean principles into three-dimensional space, rather than a fundamentally different type of geometry. It was perceived merely as Euclidean geometry applied to a curved surface, not challenging the core axioms of Euclid's plane geometry.
Violation of Euclidean Axioms
: Unlike hyperbolic geometry, which explicitly rejects Euclid's parallel postulate, spherical geometry subtly contravenes several Euclidean axioms. Notably, it violates the axiom that exactly one straight line can be drawn between any two points, as this fails for antipodal points on a sphere (like the North and South Poles), where infinite great circles can be drawn.
Implications and Revelations
The revolutionary aspect of Lobachevsky's and Bolyai's non-Euclidean geometries lies in their explicit challenge to and departure from Euclidean axioms as the only framework for understanding geometry. They proposed geometries where Euclid's axioms were not just bent to fit a curved space (as in spherical geometry) but were wholly inapplicable, thereby expanding the scope and understanding of geometry in abstract spaces.
This broader perspective on geometry opened up new ways of thinking about space, fundamentally altering the mathematical landscape and paving the way for advancements in various scientific fields, including physics, cosmology, and more. It showed that alternative geometric systems could coexist, each with its own internal consistency and applicability, challenging the universality of Euclidean geometry and enriching the development of mathematical thought.

On the other hand, the Hyperbolic Geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai was a much more
serious affront to Euclidean Geometry, containing familiar lines of infinite length, yet flaunting
multiple parallels, ludicrous angle sums, and many other seemingly nonsensical results. Yet the
21-year-old Bolyai was confident and exuberant in his discoveries, writing to his father, ���From
nothing I have created another entirely new world.���
We end with a tale of tragedy. Bolyai���s father was a friend of Gauss, and sent him what
J��nos had achieved. By this time Gauss had himself made some important discoveries in this
area, but had kept them secret. In any case, J��nos had seen further than Gauss. A kind word in
public from Gauss, the most famous mathematician in the world, would have assured the young
mathematician a bright future. But Nature and nurture sometimes conspire to pour extraordinary
mathematical gifts into a vessel marred by very ordinary human flaws, and Gauss���s reaction to
Bolyai���s marvellous discoveries was mean-spirited and self-serving in the extreme.
First, Gauss kept Bolyai in suspense for six months, then he replied as follows:
Now something about the work of your son. You will probably be shocked for a moment
when I begin by saying that I cannot praise it, but I cannot do anything else, since to praise
it would be to praise myself. The whole content of the paper, the path that your son has
taken, and the results to which he has been led, agree almost everywhere with my own
meditations, which have occupied me in part for 30���35 years.
Gauss did however ���thank��� Bolyai���s son for having ���saved him the trouble���10 of having to write
down theorems he had known for decades.
J��nos Bolyai never recovered from the surgical blow delivered by Gauss, and he abandoned
mathematics for the rest of his life
ChatGPT
The story of J��nos Bolyai is one of great intellectual triumph and personal tragedy, highlighting both the revolutionary nature of hyperbolic geometry and the harsh realities of academic acknowledgment and rivalry during the era.
J��nos Bolyai's Contributions
J��nos Bolyai's work on hyperbolic geometry challenged the very foundations of the mathematical understanding of his time. His audacious claim of having created a new world from nothing captures the magnitude of his intellectual breakthrough. Hyperbolic geometry, with its rejection of Euclid���s parallel postulate, introduced concepts such as lines of infinite length and multiple parallel lines through a given point not intersecting a given line, fundamentally altering the landscape of geometry.
Gauss's Response
The response of Carl Friedrich Gauss, a leading mathematician who had also explored similar ideas in secrecy, is a poignant element of this narrative. Gauss's acknowledgment that praising Bolyai���s work would equate to praising his own reflects his prior engagement with these ideas. However, his reaction also demonstrates a reluctance to share the spotlight or acknowledge the independent achievements of a younger mathematician, which was not uncommon in the competitive and ego-driven environment of academia at the time.
The Impact on Bolyai
The interaction with Gauss had a devastating impact on Bolyai. Despite the groundbreaking nature of his work, the lack of recognition and encouragement from Gauss, coupled with Gauss's demeaning remarks, effectively ended Bolyai's career in mathematics. This event underscores the significant role that mentorship and recognition can play in the careers of young scientists and mathematicians.
Broader Implications
The story of Bolyai and Gauss illustrates several broader themes in the history of science and mathematics:
Intellectual Territory and Originality
: The protection of intellectual territory and the priority of discovery are themes that have recurred throughout the history of science. Gauss's secretive nature and his initial withholding of encouragement or acknowledgment reflect a protective stance over his intellectual territory.
Recognition and Mentorship
: The role of established figures in recognizing and nurturing younger talent is crucial. Positive reinforcement can propel young scientists to further their research, while dismissive or overly critical responses can stifle promising careers.
Personal Struggles and Professional Achievements
: The personal struggles of historical figures like Bolyai humanize them, reminding us that the path to scientific achievement is often fraught with personal challenges and societal hurdles.
This episode is a reminder of the complex interplay between individual genius, professional rivalry, and the social structures of science, illustrating how personal dynamics and professional ethics can deeply influence scientific progress and the careers of individuals involved.

The Angular Excess of a Spherical Triangle
As we have said, the parallel axiom is equivalent to the fact that the angles in a triangle sum to ��. It
follows that both the spherical axiom and the hyperbolic axiom must lead to geometries in which
the angles do not sum to ��. To quantify this departure from Euclidean Geometry, we introduce the
angular excess, defined to be the amount E by which the angle sum exceeds ��:
E ��� (angle sum of triangle) ��� ��.
For example, for the triangle shown in [1.6], E = (�� +
��
2 +
��
2
) ��� �� = ��.
A crucial insight now arises if we compare the triangle���s angular excess with its area A. Let the
radius of the sphere be R. Since the triangle occupies a fraction (��/2��) of the northern hemisphere,
A = (��/2��) 2��R2 = �� R2
. Thus,
E =
1
R
2 A. (1.3)
[1.7] Thomas Harriot (1560���1621).
In 1603 the English mathematician Thomas
Harriot (see [1.7]) made the remarkable discovery12 that this relationship holds for any triangle
��� on the sphere; see [1.8a]. Harriot���s elementary
but ingenious argument13 goes as follows.
Prolonging the great-circle sides of ��� divides
the surface of the sphere into eight triangles, the
four triangles labelled ���, �����, �����, ����� each being
paired with a congruent antipodal triangle. This
is clearer in [1.8b]. Since the area of the sphere is
4��R2
, we deduce that
A(���) + A(�����) + A(�����) + A(�����) = 2��R2
. (1.4)
On the other hand, it is clear in [1.8b] that ���
and ����� together form a wedge whose area is a
fraction (��/2��) of the area of the sphere:
A(���) + A(�����) = 2��R2
.
Similarly,
A(���) + A(�����) = 2��R2
,
A(���) + A(�����) = 2��R2
.

Historical Context and Mathematical Proofs
Thomas Harriot���s Contribution
: The 1603 discovery by Thomas Harriot that this relationship holds for any spherical triangle illustrates an early understanding of spherical geometry���s unique properties. Harriot���s method of prolonging the great-circle sides to form eight triangles, including congruent antipodal pairs, cleverly utilizes the sphere's total area to deduce the areas of individual components.
Proof by Division and Congruence
:
By dividing the sphere with great circles extended from the triangle's sides, Harriot partitions the sphere into smaller, manageable geometric shapes.
This division results in four triangles on one hemisphere, each paired with a congruent triangle on the opposite hemisphere.
The area calculations for these triangle pairs (like
��
\Delta

and

\Delta\alpha

This analysis not only enriches the understanding of spherical geometry but also highlights its departure from flat-Euclidean geometry by linking geometric properties (angles) directly to topological properties (area). The angular excess provides a clear, quantifiable difference that is both elegant and profound, offering deep insights into how geometry functions on curved surfaces. This understanding is crucial for fields such as geodesy, astronomy, and physics, where the real-world application of spherical geometry is necessary for models involving Earth and celestial mechanics.

Intrinsic and Extrinsic Geometry of Curved Surfaces
The mathematics associated with this stretched-string construction of a ���straight line��� will be
explored in depth later in the book. For now we merely observe that the construction can be
applied equally well to a nonspherical surface, such as the crookneck squash shown in [1.9].
Just as on the sphere, we stretch a string over the surface, thereby finding the shortest,
straightest route between two points, such as a and b. Provided that the string can slide around
on the surface easily, the tension in the string ensures that the resulting path is as short as
possible. Note that in the case of cd, we must imagine that the string runs over the inside of the
surface.
In order to deal with all possible pairs of points in a uniform way, it is therefore best to imagine
the surface as made up of two thinly separated layers, with the string trapped between them.
On the other hand, this is only useful for thought experiments, not actual experiments. We shall
overcome this obstacle shortly by providing a practical method of constructing these straightest
curves on the surface of a physical object, even if the patch of surface bends the wrong way for a
string to be stretched tightly over the outside of the object.
These shortest paths on a curved surface are the equivalent of straight lines in the plane, and
they will play a crucial role throughout this book���they are called geodesics. Thus, to use this new
word, we may say that geodesics in the plane are straight lines, and geodesics on the sphere are
great circles.
But even on the sphere the length-minimizing definition of ���geodesic��� is provisional, because
we see that nonantipodal points are connected by two arcs of the great circle passing through them:
the short one (which is the shortest route) and the long one. Yet the long arc is every bit as much a
geodesic as the short one. There is the additional complication on the sphere that antipodal points
[1.9] The intrinsic geometry of the surface of a crookneck squash: geodesics are the equivalents of straight lines,
and triangles formed out of them may possess an angular excess of either sign, depending on how the surface
bends: E(���1) > 0 and E(���2) < 0.
are connected by multiple geodesics, and this nonuniqueness occurs on more general surfaces, too.
What is true is that any two points that are sufficiently close together can be joined by a unique
geodesic segment that is the shortest route between them.
Just as a line segment in the plane can be extended indefinitely in either direction by laying
down overlapping segments, so too can a geodesic segment be extended on a curved surface, and
this extension is unique. For example, in [1.9] we have extended the dashed geodesic segment
connecting the black dots, by laying down the overlapping dotted segment between the white
points.
Because of the subtleties associated with the length-minimizing characterization of geodesics,
before long we will provide an alternative, purely local characterization of geodesics, based on
their straightness.
With these caveats in place, it is now clear how we should define distance within a surface
such as [1.9]: the distance between two sufficiently close points a and b is the length of the geodesic
segment connecting them.
Figure [1.9] shows how we may then define, for example, a ���circle of radius r and centre c���
as the locus of points at distance r from c. To construct this geodesic circle we may take a piece of
string of length r, hold one end fixed at c, then (keeping the string taut) drag the other end round
on the surface. But just as the angles in a triangle no longer sum to ��, so now the circumference
of a circle no longer is equal to 2��r. In fact you should be able to convince yourself that for the
illustrated circle the circumference is less than 2��r.
ChatGPT
The passage delves into the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of curved surfaces, focusing on the concept of geodesics, which are analogous to straight lines in Euclidean geometry. Here's an analysis of the key points and concepts discussed:
Geodesics on Curved Surfaces
Definition and Concept
: Geodesics are defined as the shortest paths between points on a surface. This is akin to the concept of straight lines on a plane, but adapted to curved geometries like spheres or irregularly shaped objects like a crookneck squash. The geodesics are determined by stretching a string taut between two points on the surface, ensuring the path follows the surface's curvature.
Practical and Theoretical Considerations
: While the string method provides a clear visual and practical approach to understanding geodesics, the text acknowledges the complexity when the surface does not allow for an easy external path. For example, paths may need to be considered internally, or across surfaces that fold inwards or have complex topologies.
Unique and Non-Unique Geodesics
Non-Uniqueness
: On spheres, most pairs of non-antipodal points have two connecting geodesics (the shorter and longer arcs of the great circle), both of which are technically geodesics. Antipodal points present a particular challenge as they are connected by an infinite number of geodesics, reflecting the high degree of symmetry and the lack of a 'preferred' direction on the sphere.
Uniqueness for Short Distances
: For points that are sufficiently close, there is a unique geodesic segment connecting them, which is the shortest route between those points. This reflects a local property of geodesics that can simplify calculations and understanding in a restricted domain.
Geodesics and Measurement on Curved Surfaces
Extension and Measurement
: Geodesics can be extended beyond initial segments by continuously laying down overlapping segments, similar to extending a line in a plane. This process is crucial for defining and measuring distances on curved surfaces.
Circle Construction and Geometric Properties
: Constructing a circle on a curved surface involves keeping a string fixed at one point and moving the other end around while keeping it taut. This construction highlights another departure from Euclidean geometry: the circumference of such a circle on a curved surface does not adhere to the familiar Euclidean formula of
2
��
r
2\pi r
2
��
r
.
Implications and Future Directions
Alternative Characterizations
: The text hints at upcoming discussions that will provide alternative definitions of geodesics that do not solely rely on the length-minimizing property but also consider their intrinsic straightness. This approach is crucial for understanding geodesics in more complex geometrical frameworks where traditional methods may fall short.
Distance and Curvature
: Defining distance on curved surfaces using geodesics reflects an intrinsic approach to geometry that focuses on properties defined purely within the surface, without reference to the external space. This intrinsic perspective is essential for understanding how geometry operates under constraints of curvature and topology.
This exploration of geodesics in the passage offers deep insights into the nature of curved spaces, providing a foundational understanding that is essential for further studies in differential geometry, general relativity, and various fields of physics and engineering where the geometry of space plays a critical role.

Given three points on the surface, we may join them with geodesics to form a geodesic
triangle; [1.9] shows two such triangles, ���1 and ���2:
��� Looking at the angles in ���1, it seems clear that they sum to more than ��, so E(���1) > 0, like a
triangle in Spherical Geometry.
[1.10] Bending a piece of paper changes the extrinsic geometry, but not the intrinsic geometry.
��� On the other hand, it is equally clear that the angles of ���2 sum to less than ��: E(���2) < 0, and
(as we shall explain) this opposite behaviour is in fact exhibited by triangles in Hyperbolic
Geometry. Note also that if we construct a circle in this saddle-shaped part of the surface, the
circumference is now greater than 2��r.
The concept of a geodesic belongs to the so-called intrinsic geometry of the surface���a fundamentally new view of geometry, introduced by Gauss (1827). It means the geometry that is
knowable to tiny, ant-like, intelligent (but 2-dimensional!) creatures living within the surface. As
we have discussed, these creatures can, for example, define a geodesic ���straight line��� connecting
two nearby points as the shortest route within their world (the surface) connecting the two points.
From there they can go on to define triangles, and so on. Defined in this way, it is clear that the
intrinsic geometry is unaltered when the surface is bent (as a piece of paper can be) into quite
different shapes in space, as long as distances within the surface are not stretched or distorted in
any way. To the ant-like creatures within the surface, such changes are utterly undetectable.
Under such a bending, the so-called extrinsic geometry (how the surface sits in space) most
certainly does change. See [1.10]. On the left is a flat piece of paper on which we have drawn a
triangle ��� with angles (��/2), (��/6), and (��/3). Of course E(���) = 0. Clearly we can bend such a
flat piece of paper into either of the two (extrinsically) curved surfaces on the right.14 However,
intrinsically these surfaces have undergone no change at all���they are both as flat as a pancake!
The illustrated triangles on these surfaces (into which ��� is carried by our stretch-free bending of
the paper) are identical to the ones that intelligent ants would construct using geodesics, and in
both cases E = 0: geometry on these surfaces is Euclidean.
Even if we take a patch of a surface that is intrinsically curved, so that a triangle within it has
E ��= 0, it too can generally be bent somewhat without stretching or tearing it, thereby altering its
extrinsic geometry while leaving its intrinsic geometry unaltered. For example, cut a ping pong
ball in half and gently squeeze the rim of one of the hemispheres, distorting that circular rim into
an oval (but not an oval lying in a single plane).
ChatGPT
The passage provides a vivid illustration of the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, particularly through the lens of geodesic triangles and their behavior on curved surfaces. Let's break down these concepts further:
Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Geometry
Intrinsic Geometry
: This aspect of geometry concerns the properties of a surface that are preserved under deformations that do not involve stretching or tearing. It's the geometry experienced by beings confined to the surface itself, such as the two-dimensional creatures described. Intrinsic geometry is concerned with distances, angles, and other properties measured purely within the surface. For example, the sum of the angles in triangles (their angular excess
E
E
E
) and the properties of geodesics or "straight lines" on the surface are all intrinsic properties.
Extrinsic Geometry
: In contrast, extrinsic geometry refers to how a surface is embedded in the surrounding space. This includes how it curves and bends in three dimensions. Changes in extrinsic geometry can occur without affecting the intrinsic geometry, as demonstrated by bending a flat piece of paper into different shapes.

2
��
r
2\pi r
2
��
r
. This contrasts with Euclidean and spherical geometries, providing a tangible example of how intrinsic geometry affects basic geometric constructions.
Bending Paper Experiment
: The example of bending a flat piece of paper into different shapes without stretching illustrates how intrinsic properties (like angle sums in triangles) remain unchanged despite changes in the paper's shape in three-dimensional space. This experiment effectively demonstrates the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry.
Philosophical and Mathematical Significance
This discussion bridges the conceptual with the practical, offering insights into how geometry can be understood and experienced differently depending on the perspective (internal vs. external) and the nature of the surface involved. The idea that intrinsic properties remain constant despite changes in how a surface is shaped or embedded in space is fundamental in fields like topology, differential geometry, and general relativity, where the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties often leads to profound insights about the nature of spaces and universes.
Overall, the exploration of these concepts not only enriches the understanding of geometry but also challenges our perceptions of space, surface, and dimension, inviting deeper inquiry into how we measure and interact with the physical world around us.

Constructing Geodesics via Their Straightness
We have already alluded to the fact that geodesics on a surface have at least two characteristics in
common with lines in the plane: (1) they provide the shortest route between two points that are
not too far apart and (2) they provide the ���straightest��� route between these points. In this section
we seek to clarify what we mean by ���straightness,��� leading to a very simple and practical method
of constructing geodesics on a physical surface.
Most texts on Differential Geometry pay scant attention to such practical matters, and it is
perhaps for this reason that the construction we shall describe is surprisingly little known in
the literature.15 In sharp contrast, in this book we urge you to explore the ideas by all means
possible: theoretical contemplation, drawing, computer experiments, and (especially!) physical
experiments with actual surfaces. Your local fruit and vegetable shop can supply your laboratory
with many interesting shapes, such as the yellow summer squash shown in [1.11].
We can now use this vegetable to reveal the hidden straightness of geodesics via an experiment that we hope you will repeat for yourself:
1. On a fruit or vegetable, construct a geodesic by stretching a string over its curved surface.
2. Use a pen to trace the path of the string, then remove the string.
3. Make shallow incisions on either side of (and close to) the inked path, then use a vegetable
peeler or small knife to remove the narrow strip of peel between the two cuts.
4. Lay the strip of peel flat on the table, and witness the marvellous fact that the geodesic within
the peeled strip has become a straight line in the plane!
But why?!
To understand this, first let us be clear that although the strip is free to bend in the direction
perpendicular to the surface (i.e., perpendicular to itself), it is rigid if we try to bend it sideways,
tangent to the surface. Now let us employ proof by contradiction, and imagine what would happen if such a peeled geodesic did not yield a straight line when laid flat on the table. It is both a [1.12] Suppose that the illustrated dotted path is a geodesic such that a narrow (white) strip surrounding it does
not become a straight line when laid flat in the plane. But in that case we can shrink the dotted path in the plane
(towards the shortest, straight-line route in the plane) thereby producing the solid path. But if we then reattach
the strip to the surface, this solid path is still shorter than the original dotted path, which was supposed to be the
shortest path within the surface���a contradiction!
drawback and an advantage of conducting such physical experiments that they will simply not
permit us to construct something that is impossible, as is required in our desired mathematical
proof by contradiction. Nevertheless, let us suppose that there exists a geodesic path, such as the
dotted one shown on top left of [1.12], that when peeled and laid flat on the table (on the right)
does not become a straight line.

The passage discusses an inventive, hands-on method to explore and demonstrate the concept of geodesics���paths that embody both the shortest and the "straightest" routes on a surface. This approach not only makes abstract geometrical concepts accessible but also illustrates fundamental properties of geodesics in an engaging way. Let���s delve into the details of this experiment and its implications:
Experiment Description
Constructing a Geodesic on a Curved Surface
:
Materials
: The experiment utilizes everyday items such as a fruit or vegetable and a string, making the concept tangible and relatable.
Procedure
: A string is stretched tightly across the surface of a curved object like a squash to define the geodesic path. The path is then marked with a pen.
Further Steps
: Shallow incisions are made along this path, and a strip of the surface is peeled off.
Observing Geodesic Straightness
:
After peeling and flattening the strip on a table, the path that was curved on the vegetable appears as a straight line. This transformation visually and physically demonstrates that the geodesic, while appearing curved on the three-dimensional surface, is intrinsically straight.
Geometric and Physical Principles
Intrinsic Straightness
:
The intrinsic property of the geodesic is highlighted when the curved path on a three-dimensional object translates into a straight line in two dimensions once removed from its original context. This shows that the curvature of the path was due to the curvature of the object itself, not the path.
Proof by Contradiction
:
The text suggests using proof by contradiction to understand why the geodesic must be straight when isolated from its curved background. If the peeled path were not straight, it implies that there could be a shorter path than the one defined by the geodesic, which contradicts the definition of a geodesic as the shortest path between two points on the surface.
Educational Benefits and Insights
Engagement and Exploration
:
Encouraging physical experimentation with real-world objects as a way to explore geometric concepts makes the learning process more dynamic and interactive. This method helps bridge the gap between theoretical geometry and tangible experiences.
Understanding Geodesic Properties
:
This experiment provides a clear, intuitive insight into how geodesics work on curved surfaces and why they are considered the shortest and straightest paths in their intrinsic geometry. It also demonstrates the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic properties���how a path's properties can change depending on the space in which it is viewed.
Visual and Kinesthetic Learning
:
By engaging with geometry through visual and kinesthetic means, learners can more deeply understand and remember the properties of geodesics and the concept of intrinsic versus extrinsic geometry.
Conclusion
The experiment described in the passage is an excellent example of how complex theoretical concepts can be made accessible and engaging through creative, hands-on activities. It not only demonstrates the intrinsic properties of geodesics but also enriches the learner's understanding of geometry by connecting abstract mathematical ideas to everyday physical experiences.

The shortest route between the ends of this dotted (nonstraight) plane curve is the straight
line connecting them. (As illustrated, this is the path of the true geodesic we already found using
the string���but pretend you don���t know that for now!) Thus we may shorten the dotted curve by
deforming it slightly towards this straight, shortest route, yielding the solid path along the edge
of the peeled strip. Therefore, after reattaching the strip to the surface (bottom left) the solid curve
provides a shorter route over the surface than the dotted one, which we had supposed to be the
shortest: a contradiction! Thus we have proved our previous assertion:
If a narrow strip surrounding a segment G of a geodesic is cut out of a surface and
laid flat in the plane, then G becomes a segment of a straight line.
(1.6)
We are now very close to the promised simple and practical construction of geodesics. Look
again at step 3 of [1.11], where we peeled off the strip of surface. But imagine now that we are
reattaching the strip to the surface, instead. Ignore the history of how we got to this point: what are
we actually doing right now in this reattachment process? We have picked up a narrow straight
strip (of three-dimensional peel���but mathematically idealized as a two-dimensional strip) and
we have unrolled it back onto the surface into the shallow channel from which we cut it. But here is the crucial observation: this shallow channel need not exist���the surface decides where the strip
must go as we unroll it!
Thus, as a kind of time-reversed converse of (1.6), we obtain a remarkably simple and practical method16 of constructing geodesics on a physical surface:
To construct a geodesic on a surface, emanating from a point p in direction v, stick
one end of a length of narrow sticky tape down at p and unroll it onto the surface,
starting in the direction v.
(1.7)
(Note, however, that this does not provide a construction of the geodesic connecting p to a
specified target point q.)
If this construction seems too simple to be true, please try it on any curved surface you have
to hand. You can check that the sticky tape17 is indeed tracing out a geodesic by stretching a string
over the surface between two points on the tape: the string will follow the same path as the tape.
But note that, as a promised bonus, this new tape construction works on any part of a surface, even
where the surface is concave towards you, so that the stretched-string construction breaks down.
Of course all of this is a concrete manifestation of a mathematical idealization. A totally flat
narrow strip of tape of nonzero width cannot18 be made to fit perfectly on a genuinely curved
surface, but its centre line can be made to rest on the surface, while the rest of the tape is tangent
to the surface.
ChatGPT
The passage provides an insightful and practical method for understanding and constructing geodesics on curved surfaces through physical experimentation. It highlights a novel way to visualize and manipulate the intrinsic properties of geodesics by removing and then reattaching a strip of material from a curved surface. Let���s analyze the key concepts and methodologies described:
Theoretical Background and Practical Application
Physical Experiment with Geodesics
:
The experiment involves marking a geodesic with a string on a curved surface, tracing it, making shallow cuts along this path, and then peeling off the strip. When this strip is flattened, the path straightens, demonstrating that the geodesic is indeed the straightest and shortest path between two points on the surface.
Proof by Contradiction
:
By arguing that if the geodesic were not the shortest path, one could deform it into a shorter path, the text offers a proof by contradiction. This proof solidifies the understanding that a geodesic, by definition, is the shortest route between two points on a curved surface.
Reattachment of the Strip
:
When the strip is reattached to the surface, it must fit back into its original position, reinforcing the notion that the geodesic���s path is determined by the surface���s intrinsic geometry. This reattachment illustrates that even though the strip was straightened when removed, its inherent properties as a segment of a geodesic remain unchanged.
Simplified Method for Constructing Geodesics
Using Sticky Tape
:
A practical and innovative method for constructing geodesics is introduced using sticky tape. By sticking one end of the tape at a point and unrolling it in a chosen direction, the tape naturally adheres to the surface along a geodesic path. This method is particularly useful as it can be applied to any curved surface, regardless of its concavity or convexity.
Verification and Limitations
:
Verification of the tape���s path as a geodesic can be done by comparing it with the path a string would take. This method, while straightforward, does not necessarily connect two predetermined points but rather traces a geodesic from a starting point in a given direction.
The practical limitations of this method reflect the real-world challenges of applying mathematical ideals, as a perfectly flat tape cannot conform exactly to a curved surface without some part of the tape lifting off, except along its centerline.
Educational and Practical Implications
The methods discussed are not only scientifically intriguing but also educationally enriching, offering students and enthusiasts a hands-on way to explore complex geometric concepts. Such experiments bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theories and tangible experiences, making the study of differential geometry more accessible and engaging.
This approach not only deepens understanding but also encourages creativity in educational settings, allowing learners to discover fundamental geometric properties through direct interaction with physical objects. This hands-on exploration can lead to a more profound appreciation of the complexities and beauties of geometry in the natural world.

The Nature of Space
Let us return to the history of the discovery of non-Euclidean Geometry, and take our first look at
how these two new geometries differ from Euclid���s.
As we have said, Euclidean Geometry, is characterized by the vanishing of E(���). Note that,
unlike the original formulation of the parallel axiom, this statement can be checked against experiment:
construct a triangle, measure its angles, and see if they add up to ��. Gauss may have been the first
person to ever conceive of the possibility that physical space might not be Euclidean, and he even
attempted the above experiment, using three mountain tops as the vertices of his triangle, and
using light rays for its edges.
Within the accuracy permitted by his equipment, he found E = 0. Quite correctly, Gauss did
not conclude that physical space is definitely Euclidean in structure, but rather that if it is not
Euclidean then its deviation from Euclidean Geometry is extremely small. But he did go so far as
to say (see Rosenfeld 1988, p. 215) that he wished that this non-Euclidean Geometry might apply
to the real world. In Act IV we shall see that this was a prophetic statement.
16This important fact is surprisingly hard to find in the literature. After we (re)discovered it, more than 30 years ago, we began
searching, and the earliest mention of the underlying idea we could find at that time was in Aleksandrov (1969, p. 99), albeit
in a less practical form: he imagined pressing a flexible metal ruler down onto the surface. Later, the basic idea also appeared
in Koenderink (1990), Casey (1996), and Henderson (1998). However, we have since learned that the essential idea (though not
in our current, practical form) goes all the way back to Levi-Civita, more than a century ago! See the footnote on page 236.
17We recommend using masking tape (aka painter���s tape) because it comes in bright colours, and once a strip has been created,
it can be detached and reattached repeatedly, with ease. A simple way to create narrow strips (from the usually wide roll of
tape) is to stick a length of tape down onto a kitchen cutting board, then use a sharp knife to cut down its length, creating
strips as narrow as you please.
18This is a consequence of a fundamental theorem we shall meet later, called the Theorema Egregium.
1.6 The Nature of Space ��� 15
Although Gauss had bragged to friends that he had anticipated the Hyperbolic Geometry
of Lobachevsky and Bolyai by decades, even he had unknowingly been scooped on some of its
central results.
In 1766 (eleven years before Gauss was born) Lambert rediscovered Harriot���s result on the
sphere and then broke totally new ground in pursuing the analogous consequences of the Hyperbolic Axiom (1.1). First, he found that a triangle in Hyperbolic Geometry (if such a thing even
existed) would behave oppositely to one in Spherical Geometry:
��� In Spherical Geometry the angle sum of a triangle is greater than ��: E > 0.
��� In Hyperbolic Geometry the angle sum of a triangle is less than ��: E < 0.
Thus a hyperbolic triangle behaves like a triangle drawn on a saddle-shaped piece of surface, like
���2 in [1.9]. Later we shall see that this is no accident.
Furthermore, Lambert discovered the crucial fact that E(���) is again simply proportional
to A(���):
In both Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometry,
E(���) = K A(���),
where K is a constant that is positive in Spherical Geometry, and negative in
Hyperbolic Geometry.
(1.8)
Several interesting observations can be made in connection with this result:
��� Although there are no qualitative differences between them, there are nevertheless infinitely
many different Spherical Geometries, depending on the value of the positive constant K.
Likewise, each negative value of K yields a different Hyperbolic Geometry.
��� Since the angle sum of a triangle cannot be negative, E > �����. Thus in Hyperbolic Geometry
(K < 0) we have the strange and surprising result that no triangle can have an area greater than
|��/K|.
��� From (1.8) we deduce that two triangles of different size cannot have the same angles. In other
words, in non-Euclidean Geometry, similar triangles do not exist! (This accords with Wallis���s
1663 discovery that the existence of similar triangles is equivalent to the Parallel Axiom.)
��� Closely related to the previous point is the fact that in non-Euclidean Geometry there exists
an absolute unit of length. (Gauss himself found it to be an exciting possibility that this purely
mathematical fact might be realized in the physical world.) For example, in Spherical Geometry we could define this absolute unit of length to be the side of the equilateral triangle
having, for instance, angle sum 1.01��. Similarly, in Hyperbolic Geometry we could define it
to be the side of the equilateral triangle having angle sum 0.99��.
��� A somewhat more natural way of defining the absolute unit of length is in terms of the constant K. Since the radian measure of angle is defined as a ratio of lengths, E is a pure number.
On the other hand, the area A has units of (length)2
. It follows that K must have units of
1/(length)2
, and so there exists a length R such that K can be written as follows: K = +(1/R2
)
in Spherical Geometry; K = ���(1/R2
) in Hyperbolic Geometry. Of course in Spherical Geometry we already know that the length R occurring in the formula K = +(1/R2
) is simply the
16 ��� Chapter 1 Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
radius of the sphere. Later we will see that this length R occurring in the formula K = ���(1/R2
)
can be given an equally intuitive and concrete interpretation in Hyperbolic Geometry.
��� The smaller the triangle, the harder it is to distinguish it from a Euclidean triangle: only when
the linear dimensions are a significant fraction of R will the differences become discernable.
For example, we humans are small compared to the radius of the Earth, so if we find ourselves
in a boat in the middle of a lake, its surface appears to be a Euclidean plane, whereas in reality
it is part of a sphere. This Euclidean illusion for small figures is the reason that Gauss chose the
largest possible triangle to conduct his light-ray experiment, thereby increasing his chances
of detecting any small curvature that might be present in the space through which the light
rays travelled.

The passage provides a rich discussion on the nature of space and the historical development of non-Euclidean geometry, exploring how these geometries challenge and expand upon traditional Euclidean concepts. Let���s delve into the main points:
Historical Context and Experiments
Gauss's Experiment
:
Carl Friedrich Gauss
, often considered one of the greatest mathematicians, conducted an empirical test using three mountain tops to form a triangle. He measured the angles to test whether physical space conforms to Euclidean geometry. His findings, showing

within his measurement precision, suggested that if physical space deviates from Euclidean principles, such deviations are extremely subtle at terrestrial scales.
Non-Euclidean Geometries
:
Gauss contemplated that non-Euclidean geometries might describe physical space, a notion considered radical at the time. This foreshadowed modern applications in physics, particularly in general relativity where space is indeed non-Euclidean.
Lambert���s Contributions
Hyperbolic and Spherical Geometries
:
Johann Heinrich Lambert

Non-Euclidean Geometry���s Unique Properties
Lack of Similar Triangles
:
A remarkable aspect of non-Euclidean geometries is that similar triangles (triangles that have the same angles but different sizes) do not exist. This contrasts sharply with Euclidean geometry and is linked to the non-validity of the parallel postulate in non-Euclidean contexts.
Absolute Unit of Length

K
and how this relates to physical dimensions in the respective geometries.
Practical Implications and Philosophical Insights
Gauss���s Speculations and Modern Physics
:
The discussion hints at how these early mathematical explorations anticipated concepts in modern physics, where the structure of space is not inherently Euclidean.
Perception vs. Reality
:
The example of perceiving a flat lake surface as Euclidean when it is part of a large spherical Earth illustrates the difficulty of intuitively grasping non-Euclidean properties in everyday life.
Conclusion
This exploration into the nature of space and the evolution of geometric understanding not only enriches the historical narrative of mathematics but also emphasizes the profound implications of these ideas in understanding the universe. The blend of empirical experiments, theoretical developments, and their philosophical and practical ramifications showcases the dynamic and interconnected nature of mathematical discovery and its impact on our understanding of the world.
