Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go!
Here we go!
All the jazz is down
All the jazz is down
All of the jazz is down
Like a lizard in Georgia, or a train, I think
I called out your name, girl, you're in the heat of night
Nobody answered, something's right
Riff is the chump, it's between night and night
You see there's somebody, there'd be still some time
I don't hear a circle, I hear it ring
I'm tossing and turning, and crying in pain
Like a Japanese cowboy, or another brown-skinned
I'm a lizard in Georgia, or a train, I think
I called out your name, girl, you're in the heat of night
Nobody answered, something's right
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
From the rain, and I'm in shock, and the tears in my eyes
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
And look over at something new, I've got nothing to put time
I can't hear it off my mind
Like a Japanese cowboy, or a brown-skinned
Like a lizard in Georgia, or a train, I think
I called out your name, girl, you're in the heat of night
Nobody answered, something's right
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
From the rain, and I'm in shock, and the tears in my eyes
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
From the rain, and I'm in shock, and the tears in my eyes
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
From the rain, and I'm in shock, and the tears in my eyes
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
From the rain, and I'm in shock, and the tears in my eyes
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
Oh, it's getting more fun in there
Thanks, little girl
I'm riding around now, and crossing the line
From the rain, and I'm in shock, and the tears in my eyes
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
Mr. Richards, how are you? You're a no-no, you're good
Come back and I'll call you in the morning
Dancing in your wasn't round, it's a girl that you love, take the sound
Hands away, you're asleep
Yes, oh, hey, Dan, Mr. Richards, how are you?
You're a villain, won't you?
Mr. Richards will make you around that time
Keep going, you know, you're dancing out loud
Now the better it is, I must spend my last time
You're a villain, won't you?
You're a villain, won't you?
You're a villain, won't you?
You're a villain, won't you?
You're a villain, won't you?
I think I'm ready
I'm ready
You guys all might count
My dinner's on fire, what she wants is to be real
You're a villain, won't you?
It's like a baby
She takes all my money and leaves with no spots
He yells at my buddies, with his songs on the phone
Now I'm waiting, I'm back, doing the best that I can
He's got the crown on the door, and the room for me
And I know the door, where I can go
You're a villain, won't you?
You can't stop me
You can't
Kiss on the road
And you can do your own shoes
In the road, get a drink
Pack your bags, I don't need a bag
On your hands you pick
But it gets not sunny
Grab my ass, I know it's in the snow
Now you're on your own chance
With a turtleneck
I can't go
Kiss on the road
But you can kiss on the road
You feel the piss you dribble
Kiss on the road
And watch me give that for the last six months
I'll be back in your bag
You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag
Took my balls to the school
It's off-white sale counseling
You have to get two percent down
And I know the door, but mine must all off
So hit the fucking road
And kiss on the road
You can't
Kiss on the road
You can't do your own shoes
In the road, get a drink
Pack your bags, I don't need a bag
On your hands you pick
But it gets not sunny
Grab my ass, I know it's in the snow
Now you're on your own chance
With a turtleneck
I can't go
Kiss on the road
You can't
Kiss on the road
You can't
Kiss on the road
You can't do your own shoes
In the road, get a drink
Pack your bags, I don't need a bag
On your hands you pick
But it gets not sunny
Grab my ass, I know it's in the snow
Now you're on your own chance
With a turtleneck
You can't
Kiss on the road
You can't get
Kiss on the road
You can't
Kiss on the road
You can't
I'll set myself on fire, I'll change you, I'll turn you around
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
I'll set myself on fire, I'll change you, I'll turn you around
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
I'll change you, I'll turn you around
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
If I can't fall, guess I'll fall for me
I don't want to leave you on the phone
I don't want to leave you on the phone
I don't want to go while just so you know
I don't want to leave you on the phone
The days don't lie and I'm still alive
But you know I'm thinking about you
Cause to now you're small to the ground
It's a sad but never-missed feeling
I don't want to leave you on the phone
I don't want to leave you on the phone
I don't want to go while just so you know
I don't want to leave you on the phone
No, tell her the home to call
I don't want to leave you on the phone
Come on, get some of your things
Thanks for your pocket money
And you're my superstar
I don't want to leave you on the phone
I don't want to go while just so you know
I don't want to leave you on the phone
The days don't lie and I'm still alive
But you know I'm thinking about you
Cause to now you're small to the ground
It's a sad but never-missed feeling
I don't want to leave you on the phone
No, tell her the home to call
I don't want to leave you on the phone
No, tell her the home to call
I don't want to leave you on the phone
Yeah!
