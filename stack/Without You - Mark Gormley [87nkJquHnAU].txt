The Space Happy Phil Thomas cat here, and this next music video is by singer-songwriter
Mark Gormley.
This is a great song, it's very, very intense, and we tried to make the music video that
way as well.
Here's Mark Gormley and Without You, on the Uncharted Zone.
Here I sit with a cigarette burning, all alone, and you're not here, all by myself,
and you're not here, all by myself, and you're not here, all by myself, and you're not here,
all by myself, and you're not here, all by myself, and you're not here, all by myself,
and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here,
all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself,
and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here,
all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself,
and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself,
and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself,
and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself, and you're not here, all by yourself,
you're watching The Uncharted Zone, the most important music television show along the Gulf Coast.
