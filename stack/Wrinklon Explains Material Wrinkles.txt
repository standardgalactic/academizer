Introducing the ���wrinklon���
20 Jun 2011 Hamish Johnston

Wrinklons in a plastic sheet
A new quasiparticle called the ���wrinklon��� could help explain why materials as diverse as graphene and household curtains wrinkle in much the same way ��� despite their very different length scales. The particle has been introduced by researchers in Belgium, France and the US as a result of measurements on a wide range of materials on length scales from micrometres to metres. While the work may not lead to more attractive curtains, wrinkles do turn out to affect the electronic properties of graphene and the analysis could therefore influence the development of graphene-based devices.

Wrinkles can appear whenever a sheet of material is fixed along one or more edges. In the case of a fabric curtain, the wrinkles are close together at the top and the space between wrinkles increases continuously further down the curtain. The emergence of wrinklons ��� by Pascal Damman and colleagues at the universities of Mons, Paris and California Riverside, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ��� reflects this change and defines the patterns of wrinkles seen in such materials.

Self-similar patterns
Physicists have enjoyed great success in describing complex systems in terms of quasiparticles ��� collective excitations that behave much like discrete particles. This latest wrinklon quasiparticle describes a localized region with a high degree of stretching where two wrinkles merge into one (see figure). Indeed, if you happen to be sitting next to a curtain, then you can probably see a few wrinklons, which may appear depending on the tension in the material and its physical properties such as thickness and elasticity.

By studying images of wrinkled materials, the team led by Damman found that the patterns are self-similar. This means that the same pattern occurs in different regions of the material but on different length scales. As Damman explains, ���If you look at a photograph of a region of the curtain without knowing the length scale, you can���t know where it was taken.���

The team demonstrated the universal nature of wrinkling by studying materials as diverse as graphene (a sheet of carbon just one atom thick), curtains made of fabric and rubber, as well as paper and plastic sheets. For each material the team measured the distance between neighbouring wrinkles (the wavelength) as a function of the distance from the fixed edge of the material (the top of a curtain, for example). They also measured the tension on the material ��� in the case of curtains this is supplied by the downward pull of gravity. The Young modulus (or elasticity) and thickness of the material were also measured.

One power law for all
The team found that the ���normalized wavelength��� (the wavelength divided by the thickness of the material) of ripples in a number of materials have the same power-law relationship with the ���normalized distance��� from the fixed edge. This distance includes a term that is a function of the tension, thickness and elasticity of the material.

When plotted on a log���log graph, measurements on materials ranging from graphene to fabric curtains fall on the same line. ���This is the best evidence yet that wrinkling occurs in the same way over a wide range of length scales,��� says Benjamin Davidovitch of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was not involved with the experiment. ���It has never been demonstrated with such clarity,��� he adds.

According to Damman, the findings could be important to those studying graphene. As the wrinklons are affected by the thickness of the material, it should be possible to determine the thickness of a sample simply by looking at its wrinkles. Researchers could therefore distinguish between graphene that is one atom thick and samples that are two or three atoms thick ��� something that can be difficult to do.

These latest results could also be used to ensure that graphene devices are made wrinkle-free, or with specific patterns of wrinkles. This could be important for those developing electronic devices based on graphene, because the electronic properties of the material are affected by wrinkles. According to Damman���s colleague Chun Ning Lau of the University of California, Riverside, devices with desirable properties could be created by ���straintronics��� ��� whereby specific wrinkle patterns are created by controlling the strain on graphene.

The work is describe in Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 224301.

A group of researchers from Belgium, France, and the United States has introduced a new quasiparticle called the "wrinklon," which could help explain why materials as diverse as graphene and household curtains wrinkle in similar ways. Despite the difference in length scales of these materials, wrinkles can occur whenever a sheet of material is fixed along one or more edges, and the emergence of these wrinklons defines the patterns of wrinkles seen in such materials.
The researchers discovered that the wrinkle patterns are self-similar, meaning the same pattern can be seen in different regions of the material but on different length scales. They found this universal nature of wrinkling by studying materials like graphene, fabric curtains, rubber, paper, and plastic sheets. They measured the distance between neighboring wrinkles, the tension on the material, and the Young modulus (or elasticity) and thickness of the material.
The team found that the "normalized wavelength" of ripples in a number of materials have the same power-law relationship with the "normalized distance" from the fixed edge, a property that spans across different materials and length scales.
The findings could be significant for researchers studying graphene, as the wrinkles can be used to determine the thickness of a sample and the electronic properties of graphene are affected by wrinkles. This could lead to the development of electronic devices based on graphene, with specific wrinkle patterns created by controlling the strain on the material. The research is described in more detail in the Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 224301.

Abstract 
We show that thin sheets under boundary conf i nement spontaneously generate a universal self- 
similar hierarchy of wrinkles. From simple geometry arguments and energy scalings, we develop a 
formalism based on wrinklons, the transition zone in the merging of two wrinkles, as building-blocks 
of the global pattern. Contrary to the case of crumple paper where elastic energy is focused, this 
transition is described as smooth in agreement with a recent numerical work [1]. This formalism 
is validated from hundreds of nm for graphene sheets to meters for ordinary curtains, which shows 
the universality of our description. We i nally describe the ef f ect of an external tension to the 
distribution of the wrinkles.

The drive towards miniaturization in technology is demanding for increasingly thinner 
components, raising new mechanical challenges [2].Thin i lms are however unstable to 
boundary or substrate-induced compressive loads: moderate compression results in regular 
wrinkling [3���7] while further conf i nement can lead to crumpling [8, 9]. Regions of stress 
focusing can be a hindrance, acting as nucleation points for mechanical failure. Conversely, 
these deformations can be exploited constructively for tunable thin structures. For example, 
singular points of deformation dramatically af f ect the electronic properties of graphene [10]. 
Here, we show that thin sheets under boundary conf i nement spontaneously generate a 
universal self-similar hierarchy of wrinkles; from strained suspended graphene to ordinary 
hanging curtains. We develop a formalism based on wrinklons, a localized transition zone 
in the merging of two wrinkles, as building-blocks to describe these wrinkled patterns.

universal self-similar hierarchy of wrinkles; from strained suspended graphene to ordinary 
hanging curtains. We develop a formalism based on wrinklons, a localized transition zone 
in the merging of two wrinkles, as building-blocks to describe these wrinkled patterns. 
To illustrate this hierarchical pattern, we show in Fig. 1a wrinkled graphene sheet along 
with an ordinary hanged curtain. These patterns are also similar to the self-similar circular 
patterns i rst reported by Argon et al. for the blistering of thin i lms adhering on a thick 
substrate [11].The diversity and complexity of those systems, characterized by various 
chemical and physical conditions, could suggest, a priori, that the underlying mechanisms 
governing the formation of these patterns are unrelated. However, these systems can be 
depicted, independently from the details of the experiments, as a thin sheet constrained at 
one edge while the others are free to adapt their morphology. These constraints can take the 
form of an imposed wavelength at one edge or just the requirement that it should remain 
l at. 
As illustrated in Fig. 1 and 2, sheets made from various materials constrained at one 
edge by an imposed sinusoidal prof i le spontaneously develop a hierarchical pattern of folds 
or wrinkles. At i rst sight, as quoted by numerous authors [9, 11���17], these patterns consist 
of a hierarchy of successive generations of folds whose typical size gradually increases along 
x (Fig. 1b). We propose to rationalize these various hierarchical patterns by considering the 
evolution of the average wavelength, ��, with the distance to the constrained edge, x. This 
evolution is adequately described by a simple power law, �� ��� xm, 
see Fig. 1c, which conf i rms 
the self-similarity of these patterns as hypothesized in previous theoretical studies [9, 12���14]. 
Interestingly, curtains made of various materials with contrasted properties exhibit similar 
exponents. We observe values close to 2/3 for ���light��� sheets and to 1/2 for ���heavy��� sheets. 
Therefore the exponent m is a robust feature of these folding patterns.

This research paper discusses the formation of wrinkles in thin sheets from various materials, such as suspended graphene and hanging curtains, under boundary confinement. These thin sheets generate a universal self-similar hierarchy of wrinkles when subjected to certain constraints. The wrinkles develop in a hierarchical pattern, with the typical size of the folds gradually increasing along the distance to the constrained edge. This phenomenon is characterized by the concept of "wrinklons," which are the transition zones where two wrinkles merge.
This study indicates that despite the diversity and complexity of the systems under various physical and chemical conditions, the underlying mechanisms governing the formation of these wrinkling patterns are similar. These patterns can be seen in thin sheets constrained at one edge, regardless of the constraints' specifics.
Contrary to crumpled paper, where the elastic energy is concentrated, the transition in these cases is smooth. The researchers developed a formalism based on wrinklons to describe these wrinkled patterns. This formalism is applicable to thin sheets of various scales, ranging from hundreds of nanometers (in the case of graphene sheets) to meters (for ordinary curtains).
Furthermore, the research provides insight into the effect of external tension on the distribution of the wrinkles. Such understanding can be useful for the development of technology, as the miniaturization trend demands increasingly thinner components. These deformations can be harnessed constructively for tunable thin structures. For example, these deformations significantly affect the electronic properties of graphene, a material of great interest in nanotechnology.
The paper also suggests that the evolution of the average wavelength of the wrinkles with the distance to the constrained edge can be described by a simple power law, confirming the self-similarity of these patterns. The results highlight the universality of the description, indicating its robustness across various materials with different properties.

Straintronics (from strain and electronics) is the study of how folds and mechanically induced stresses in a layer of two-dimensional materials can change their electrical properties.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] It is distinct from twistronics in that the latter involves changes in the angle between two layers of 2D material. However, in such multi-layers if strain is applied to only one layers, which is called heterostrain, strain can have similar effect as twist in changing electronic properties.[8][9] It is also distinct from, but similar to, the piezoelectric effects which are created by bending, twisting, or squeezing of certain material.

Straintronics is a field of study that examines how mechanically induced stresses or folds in a layer of two-dimensional materials can modify their electrical properties. This discipline is different from twistronics, which involves changes in the angle between two layers of 2D material, although if strain (referred to as heterostrain) is applied to only one of the layers in such multi-layer materials, it can have similar effects as twist in altering electronic properties.
Straintronics is also distinct from piezoelectric effects, which result from bending, twisting, or squeezing of certain materials. While both straintronics and piezoelectric effects involve changes in physical properties leading to altered electrical properties, they originate from different forms of mechanical manipulation. The focus of straintronics is on the influence of folds and stress-induced deformations on the electrical properties of 2D materials. The insights derived from this field have the potential to contribute significantly to the development of new electronic devices and technologies.

Further research into the concept of wrinklons has shown that the phenomena can be observed across various thin films at all scales. However, the transition zones of these wrinkles, or wrinklons, may differ depending on the underlying substrate. A recent study found that the evolution of the wrinklon wavelength from the edge of suspended films, described by the formula �� ��� xm, where x is the distance from the edge and m is a universal exponent, is not consistent for all materials<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Androulidakis|first=Charalampos|last2=Koukaras|first2=Emmanuel N.|last3=Sampathkumar|first3=Krishna|last4=Rahova|first4=Jaroslava|last5=Galiotis|first5=Costas|last6=Frank|first6=Otakar|title=Hierarchy of nanoscale graphene wrinkles on compliant substrate: Theory and experiment|journal=Extreme Mechanics Letters|date=2020|volume=40|pages=100948|doi=10.1016/j.eml.2020.100948}}</ref>.
