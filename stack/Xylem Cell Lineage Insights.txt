Abstract
Background
Xylem, the most abundant tissue on Earth, is responsible for lateral growth in plants. Typical xylem has a radial system composed of ray parenchyma cells and an axial system of fusiform cells. In most angiosperms, fusiform cells comprise vessel elements for water transportation and libriform fibers for mechanical support, while both functions are performed by tracheids in other vascular plants such as gymnosperms. Little is known about the developmental programs and evolutionary relationships of these xylem cell types.

Results
Through both single-cell and laser capture microdissection transcriptomic profiling, we determine the developmental lineages of ray and fusiform cells in stem-differentiating xylem across four divergent woody angiosperms. Based on cross-species analyses of single-cell clusters and overlapping trajectories, we reveal highly conserved ray, yet variable fusiform, lineages across angiosperms. Core eudicots Populus trichocarpa and Eucalyptus grandis share nearly identical fusiform lineages, whereas the more basal angiosperm Liriodendron chinense has a fusiform lineage distinct from that in core eudicots. The tracheids in the basal eudicot Trochodendron aralioides, an evolutionarily reversed trait, exhibit strong transcriptomic similarity to vessel elements rather than libriform fibers.

Conclusions
This evo-devo framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the formation of xylem cell lineages across multiple plant species spanning over a hundred million years of evolutionary history.

In a study published in Genome Biology, researchers used single-cell and laser capture microdissection transcriptomic profiling to investigate the developmental lineages of xylem cells in plants. The xylem is the most abundant tissue on Earth and is responsible for plant growth and water transport. The study focused on the lineages of ray and fusiform cells across four divergent woody angiosperms.
The findings reveal a high degree of conservation in the ray cell lineages across angiosperms but variability in the fusiform cell lineages. Core eudicots Populus trichocarpa and Eucalyptus grandis shared almost identical fusiform lineages, while the more basal angiosperm Liriodendron chinense displayed a distinct fusiform lineage. Additionally, the tracheids in the basal eudicot Trochodendron aralioides, an evolutionarily reversed trait, showed strong transcriptomic similarities to vessel elements rather than libriform fibers.
This research provides a detailed understanding of the formation of xylem cell lineages across different plant species, providing insights into over a hundred million years of evolutionary history. The discoveries may shed light on the developmental programs and evolutionary relationships of these vital plant cells.

3Molecular Dynamics: The Theory 
Let���s go back to the HamiltonianH def i nedin (3),whichgovernsthe time evolution 
of a system. We have shown that the kinetic part of H usually has a simple 
quadratic form (4). Now it���s time to look at the more complicated potential part 
of H. Unfortunately, the actual form of the potential energy V is so complicated 
that even with the power of modern computers, some approximations are needed 
before we can calculate it eff i ciently. In this section, we will i rst go through these 
approximations,andthendiscuss howtouse MD simulationstogeneratethe desired 
phase space distribution of a statistical ensemble. 
3.1The Force Field 
In MD, the specif i c form of the potential energy function V is given as a force i eld, 
where V is broken down into terms characterizing different types of interactions in 
a bimolecular system. Examples of some of the most commonly used force i elds 
are AMBER [54,117], CHARMM [69,79���81], GROMOS [92,102], and OPLS [29, 
63, 96]. Although these force i elds were initially developed by different groups, 
most of them have similar functional forms, i.e., the potential energy V is divided 
into bonded and nonbonded terms, the former of which includes the bond, angle, 
dihedral,andimproperinteractionterms, while the latter includesthe Van der Waals 
(vdW) andelectrostatic interactionterms. As an example,energyfunctionsfromthe 
CHARMM force i eld are shown below:

In molecular dynamics (MD), the time evolution of a system is governed by the Hamiltonian (H), which contains both kinetic and potential energy components. This excerpt from a paper by Y. Wang and J.A. McCammon, primarily focuses on the potential energy part, which is often complex. Because of its complexity, even with modern computational power, it's necessary to use approximations for efficient calculation.
In MD, the potential energy function (V) is represented as a force field, where V is divided into components that describe different types of interactions in a biomolecular system. Some common force fields include AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, and OPLS. While developed by different groups, these force fields often have similar forms. Specifically, the potential energy V is divided into bonded and nonbonded terms. The bonded terms encompass bond, angle, dihedral, and improper interaction terms, while nonbonded terms include Van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interaction terms. Each of these terms describes a different component of the energy within a molecular system.
For instance, in the CHARMM force field, energy functions are as follows:
Bonded energy (Vbond) depends on the deviation from the equilibrium bond length.
Angle energy (Vangle) depends on the deviation from the equilibrium bond angle.
Dihedral energy (Vdihedral) and improper energy (Vimproper) depend on the angle between the planes of three atoms, which involves four atoms in total.
Van der Waals energy (Vvdw) depends on the distance between atoms.
Electrostatic energy (Velec) is the potential energy due to electrostatic interactions between charged particles.
The understanding of these energy terms forms the basis for the operation and interpretation of molecular dynamics simulations.
