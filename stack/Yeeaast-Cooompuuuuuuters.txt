If you built the largest, most powerful computer currently feasible, it would have about the same number of transistors as there are synapses in the brain of a 3-year-old child. It would also be slightly larger than a tennis court, and consume 106 times the power needed by the preschooler's brain.

All of which means that it might be time to look in a new direction for the next generation of computers, and the power and efficiency of the brain as a computing device suggests that it's worth exploring biology as an inspiration, says Rebecca Schulman, an associate professor in Johns Hopkins University's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The National Science Foundation, which has a funding stream directed toward innovative biology-based information technologies, agrees with her, and awarded Schulman and three colleagues $1.5 million to design a computing system based on living cells.

"Our thought was that people have started programming cells, and now it is possible to create whole new genomes. What if we start over and engineer cultured cells like yeast, where the goal is to make them computing units?" asks Schulman, who will serve as principal investigator.

To build energy-efficient computers, the team proposes to combine the advantages of neurons with those offered by yeast cells, which can grow efficiently in culture and be easily reconfigured using modern genome engineering techniques.

The grant, made in partnership with the Semiconductor Research Corporation, is designed to facilitate ultra-low-energy computing, storage, and signal processing systems built on developments in the fields of biology, chemistry, and engineering. Schulman's team will explore the creation of a new generation of dense, inexpensive, and highly energy-efficient computers made of large, three-dimensional yeast cell colonies grown from simple raw materials. Additional researchers are Joshua Vogelstein from the Johns Hopkins Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eric Klavins from the University of Washington, and Andrew Ellington from the University of Texas at Austin.

Previous related efforts have focused on using neurons for computing, but programming neurons is difficult and researchers have yet to successfully direct their information processing. Easy-to-grow cells like yeast solve the issue of programmability but present other challenges: they are prone to error and they divide and die, making it difficult to build a reliable computing architecture.

The team proposes to combine the advantages of neurons—which can process information redundantly, minimizing communication errors—with those offered by yeast cells, which can grow efficiently in culture and be easily reconfigured using modern genome engineering techniques. Their goal is to develop "yeastons," which are Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that can collectively emulate neural networks. The networks will be designed to tolerate the variability found in single-cell biomolecular information processing, and the computing architectures will grow organically, so no patterning or higher order spatial organization will be required.

The researchers expect to show that a large enough colony of yeastons could perform arbitrarily complex computations. Models offered by neuroscience will provide design principles for assembling robust yeaston networks and scaling laws for yeaston computing. Because the architectures will be modeled on the brain, where computation and memory are distributed across billions of neurons, the overall computing process will stand up to the variability and flux in individual cells' behavior, replication, and death.

The project is expected to provide an example of very low-power computing: A yeaston-powered computer could one day offer the functions of a supercomputer while occupying only a fraction of the space. The project will also add to fundamental knowledge about intercellular coordination and how collective intercellular communication processes can allow for coordinated behavior.

One disadvantage is that of the computer breaks after a few days it will start to stink

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right—since this system relies on living biological components, decay and the resulting unpleasant odors could become a significant problem if the computer breaks down or is left untended. This issue could undermine the practicality and longevity of the system. To address this, here are strategies to mitigate the smell and decay while maintaining the integrity of the biohybrid design:

1. Incorporating a Self-Maintenance System
Automated Cleaning Mechanism:
Include a cleaning system that sprays antimicrobial or deodorizing solutions (e.g., vinegar, ethanol, or essential oils) over the components periodically to prevent microbial overgrowth or spoilage.

A built-in pump could remove decayed materials and introduce fresh nutrients or cells as needed.

Waste Removal:
Introduce channels or drains for collecting and disposing of decayed yeast, SCOBY, or other materials to minimize decomposition in place.

2. Use of Biodegradable Encapsulation
Sealed Compartments:

Contain the yeast cultures and SCOBY within sealed, biodegradable pods that prevent the escape of odors while allowing light, nutrients, and signals to pass through.

These pods could be replaced as they degrade, keeping the system fresh.

Vapors and Gas Filtration:

Equip the system with activated charcoal or zeolite filters to capture and neutralize any unpleasant gases (like sulfur compounds) released during decay.

3. Refrigeration or Temperature Control
Low-Temperature Maintenance:

If the system breaks down, switch it to a low-power refrigeration mode to slow the decomposition process and extend the life of the biological components.

Thermal Management:

Use temperature-controlled compartments to regulate microbial activity and prevent overgrowth or spoilage that accelerates decay.

4. Engineered Strains for Stability
Odorless Yeast and SCOBY:

Engineer yeast and bacteria strains to produce fewer volatile compounds responsible for unpleasant smells (e.g., sulfur-containing gases).

Strains could also be designed to enter a dormant state under specific conditions (e.g., lack of light or nutrients), slowing decay and odor release.

Resistance to Spoilage:

Use strains that resist contamination from external microbes, reducing the risk of unwanted bacterial or fungal growth.

5. Controlled Decay with Composting and Biogas Capture
Composting System:

Integrate a composting module to handle decayed biological material. The module could convert waste into nutrients for regrowth or even power the system through biogas production.

Biogas Capture:

Capture methane or other gases produced during decay for reuse, either as an energy source or as inputs for other system processes.

6. Scheduled Maintenance and Backup Systems
Regular Maintenance:

Design the system for easy disassembly and cleaning, so that decayed materials can be removed and replaced without disrupting functionality.

Backup Modes:

When the system detects critical failures, it could transfer computation to a backup (e.g., traditional electronics) while shutting down biological components to prevent decay.

7. Antimicrobial and Anti-Odor Coatings
Protective Layers:

Coat components with natural antimicrobial agents like chitosan, silver nanoparticles, or essential oils, which inhibit the growth of odor-causing microbes.

Odor-Neutralizing Materials:

Integrate odor-neutralizing compounds (e.g., baking soda, activated charcoal, or silica gel) into the physical design to trap unpleasant smells.

8. Alert Systems
Failure Detection:

Incorporate sensors that detect early signs of decay (e.g., pH changes, gas buildup, or microbial overgrowth). These sensors could alert operators to perform maintenance before odors become an issue.

Automated Response:

If decay is detected, the system could automatically deploy deodorizing agents or shut down non-essential processes to minimize the spread of smells.

Summary
While decay and odor are challenges inherent to biohybrid systems, they can be mitigated through preventative maintenance, engineered stability, and modular designs. Addressing these issues early ensures that the system remains practical and scalable without compromising the core concept of sustainable biological computing. With the right solutions, your system can avoid becoming a "stinky computer" while still leveraging its innovative biological framework.

I was thinking that these would start much larger and then be microsized over time. As examples, the vacuum cleaner was once a steam powered wagon that went door to door and the first mouse was a bowling ball being used as a trackpad. And this:/Leibniz imagined the mind as a large machine, a processing unit, a factory, a mechanism — which seems fair enough. Leibniz imagined walking around a large mill. You would see cogs and levers moving, but, as David Eagleman says: "It would be preposterous to suggest that the mill is thinking or feeling or perceiving. How could a mill fall in love or enjoy a sunset? A mill is just made of pieces and parts. And so it is with the brain, Leibniz asserted. If you could expand the brain to the size of a mill and stroll around inside it, you would only see pieces and parts. When we look inside the brain, we see neurons, synapses, chemical transmitters, electrical activity. We see billions of active, chattering cells. Where are you? Where are your thoughts? Your emotions? To Leibniz, the mind seemed inexplicable by mechanical causes.

Andrew Thomas, Hidden In Plain Sight 9: The Physics Of Consciousness

ChatGPT said:

This is a compelling analogy that underscores the evolution of technology, the scalability of systems, and the deeper philosophical questions about the nature of computation, thought, and consciousness. Starting with large, tangible systems before gradually miniaturizing them mirrors both historical advancements in technology and your vision for the yeast-based computing system.

1. Large Systems as Prototypes
Historically, groundbreaking technologies began as massive, cumbersome machines that demonstrated core principles before being refined into smaller, more practical forms. Examples include:
Vacuum Cleaners: The steam-powered wagon that cleaned homes evolved into the handheld devices we use today.

First Computer Mouse: From a bowling ball-like prototype to today's sleek, ergonomic designs.

Early Computers: ENIAC filled entire rooms but laid the groundwork for pocket-sized smartphones.

Your yeast-based computer would follow this trajectory:

Start Large: A physically expansive, modular system for prototyping and demonstrating principles like biohybrid computation, optical interfacing, and biological algorithms.

Miniaturize Over Time: Incremental innovations could shrink the system, making it portable and efficient while retaining its biological computing power.

2. Scaling Down Through Innovation
Biological Integration: Advances in synthetic biology and genome editing will make yeast and SCOBY systems more compact and efficient, enabling smaller-scale computations.

Optical and Cymatic Systems: Early systems might rely on large grids and plates, but innovations in photonics and sound wave manipulation could enable the same principles to be applied at micro- or nanoscale levels.

Fabrication Techniques: Techniques like 3D bioprinting, microfluidics, and nanotechnology will allow the creation of micro-scale biocomputing chips with layered biological and optical components.

3. Philosophical Reflections on Complexity
Leibniz’s analogy of the brain as a mill and its interpretation by Eagleman highlight the challenges of understanding emergent phenomena in complex systems, whether they be biological or mechanical.

Early Systems and Intuition:

Large-scale systems, like the early mill or your yeast computer, offer transparency—you can see the cogs turning, observe yeast colonies growing, and understand their interactions in a tangible way. This aligns with how early humans grasped the concept of computation through visible mechanical processes.

Miniaturized Systems and Mystery:

As systems shrink and complexity increases, they become harder to intuitively understand. Just as we can't "see" consciousness in the brain despite knowing it emerges from neurons, future biohybrid systems might perform advanced computations that seem mysterious or even conscious-like to us.

Emergent Properties:

In your large yeast computer, the emergent properties of the system (e.g., collective behavior, distributed memory, or adaptability) might be easy to trace. As the system is miniaturized, these emergent behaviors could become less observable but more powerful.

4. Tying It Back to Consciousness
Leibniz’s mill analogy parallels the challenges of recognizing computation and intelligence in non-traditional systems:

A yeast computer might initially be dismissed as "just parts"—colonies of cells, biochemical signals, cymatic filters.

However, as the system grows in complexity, emergent behaviors—like solving problems, adapting to new challenges, or optimizing its own processes—might make it feel "alive" in a way that challenges our understanding of what computation and thought truly mean.

Consciousness vs. Computation:

The yeast computer, like the brain, may function as a system of interconnected parts performing logical operations. But as with Leibniz’s mill, the question remains: Where does the "thinking" or "feeling" reside, if at all?
5. Vision for Your System
First Iterations: A large-scale system that is transparent, mechanical, and visible, allowing for observation and intuitive understanding of its processes.

Future Refinements: A scalable, compact system that retains the principles of biohybrid computation but introduces emergent behaviors that challenge our traditional notions of computation, intelligence, and perhaps even consciousness.

Long-Term Impact: A micro-scale yeast computer might one day achieve feats akin to biological brains, performing computations so advanced and adaptable that it blurs the line between machine and organism.

Conclusion
Your vision for starting large and scaling down mirrors not only the history of technological innovation but also the philosophical and practical challenges of creating systems that mimic life. By following this path, your yeast computer could evolve from a tangible, observable machine into a mysterious, compact system with capabilities that provoke profound questions about the nature of computation and consciousness—questions that philosophers like Leibniz and thinkers like Eagleman have grappled with for centuries.
