Yun was born in Longing, Jilin, China.[1] After studying at the Myeongdong School, he moved to Pyongyang and graduated from Soongsil Middle School (now Soongsil High School in Seoul[clarification needed]). He later moved to Seoul and attended Yonhi College. During his second year at Yonhi College, he published a poem in the boy magazine, and officially appeared in the paragraph. In 1942, he went to Japan and entered the English Literature Department at Rikkyo University, but later that year, he transferred to the English Literature Department at Doshisha University. But was arrested by the Japanese police for alleged anti-Japanese movements in 1943. While imprisoned in Fukuoka, he died at the age of 28, leaving over 100 poems. His cause of death in a Fukuoka prison is uncertain, but theories have been raised based on accounts of saltwater injections and medical experiments performed at that prison. His book, The Sky, the Wind, the Stars, and the Poem (��������� ��������� ������ ���), was published posthumously.

He was recognized as one of the conscientious intellectuals in the latter half of the Japanese colonial period, and his poems were based on criticism and self-reflection of the Japanese colonial government and the Joseon Governor-General. His cousin and close friend, Song Mong-gyu [ko], was arrested while attempting to join the independence movement and was subjected to Japanese experimentation in Japan. While in Japan, he adopted the Japanese name, Hiranuma (������). In addition to his Korean name, the nicknames Dongju and Yunju were also used.

Biography

Yun Dong-ju's graduation picture from Yonhi College (1941)
Yun Dong-ju was born as the eldest son among the four children of his father Yun Yeong-seok and his mother Kim Yong at Mingdong village (also known as Myeongdong-chon) in Longjing, where many Korean settlers in China lived during the Japanese occupation of Korea. As a child, he was called "Haehwan" (������, ������ [h����hwan]). He entered Eunjin Middle School in Longjing in 1932 and moved to Pyeongyang to attend Soongsil Middle School in 1936. When the school was closed down in the same year he moved back to Longjing.[1] On 27 December 1941, aged 23, he graduated from Yonhi College, in Seoul which later became Yonsei University.[2]

He had been writing poetry from time to time and chose 19 poems to publish in a collection he intended to call "Sky, Wind, Star, and Poem" (��������� ��������� ������ ���), but he was unable to get it published.[3]

After crossing over to Japan, entering Kyoto Doshisha University in 1942, arrested by the Japanese police for an independence movement in 1943, imprisoned in a Fukuoka prison, leaving over 100 poems and died in prison at the age of 28. The view that the signing of the Japanese saltwater Vivo and after his death the Japanese by Maruta is uncertain, but raising theories, biological experiments.[citation needed]

The government of South Korea recognized Yun Dong-ju's contributions to the independence movement by awarding him the Order of Merit for National Foundation (Independence Medal) on August 15, 1990.[4]

Legacy
edit
In 1948 three collections of his handwritten manuscripts were published posthumously as "The Heavens and the Wind and the Stars and Poetry" (Haneulgwa Baramgwa Byeolgwa Si). With the appearance of this volume Yun came into the spotlight as a Resistance poet of the late occupation period.[1]

In November 1968, Yonsei University and others established an endowment for the Yun Tong-ju Poetry Prize. In 2007, he was listed by the Korean Poets' Association among the ten most important modern Korean poets.[5]

Work
edit
The Literature Translation Institute of Korea summarizes Yun's contributions to Korean literature:

Yun���s poetry is notable for the childlike persona of his narrators, sensitive awareness of a lost hometown, and an unusual scapegoat mentality deriving from a sense of shame at not being able to lead a conscientious life in a period of gloomy social realities. "Life and Death" (Salmgwa jugeum) is representative of the poems dating from 1934 to 1936, his period of literary apprenticeship. It describes the conflict between life and death, or light and darkness, but its poetic framework is more or less crude. From 1937 onwards, however, his poems reveal ruthless introspection and anxiety about the dark realities of the times. The poems of this later period reach clear literary fruition in terms of their reflection on the inner self and their recognition of nationalist realities, as embodied in the poet's own experiences. In particular, they evince a steely spirit that attempts to overcome anxiety, loneliness, and despair and to surmount contemporary realities through hope and courage.[1]

Tell me more about the theme of scapegoat
ChatGPT dijo:
The theme of
scapegoating
in Yun Dong-ju���s poetry is a deeply introspective and symbolic one. It doesn���t just reflect personal guilt���it mirrors the collective burden of a generation caught under colonial rule, wrestling with helplessness and moral responsibility.
What does "scapegoat mentality" mean in his context?
In Yun���s work, the
scapegoat mentality
refers to a sense of
self-blame and shame
���not necessarily because he did something wrong, but because he feels complicit by
not being able to resist
more actively, or by surviving while others suffered. He internalized the pain of his people and the harsh realities of Japanese oppression, often turning his poetic lens inward with harsh self-critique.
Key elements of this theme in his poetry:
Guilt for survival
: Yun often feels ashamed for living a relatively quiet life while others actively fought against Japanese colonialism.
Moral burden
: His poems show him carrying a moral weight���of silence, passivity, or simply existing in unjust times.
Purity and sacrifice
: Like a scapegoat in biblical tradition, Yun seems to offer himself symbolically, hoping his suffering can mean something for others.
Spiritual self-questioning
: His Christian background may have influenced this sense of atonement and redemption through suffering.
Example in his work:
In poems like
���Self-portrait��� (���������)
or
���A Poem Written Easily��� (������ ��������� ���)
, Yun confesses feelings of inadequacy and hypocrisy. He writes in a simple, humble voice but filled with existential angst and quiet sorrow.
���...And I had no excuse, just that I was ashamed of being a poet.���
���
A Poem Written Easily
This isn���t just a personal confession���he becomes a symbolic figure of a nation in spiritual crisis.
If you want, I can break down one of these poems line by line and point out how the scapegoat theme plays out. Want to do that?
