Intoday'sinstallment,I
lookattheZennotion
of"Don'tKnowMind"in
rationalist
terms.
I'm a little unsure
where "don't know
mind" comes from.
Sensei Google suggests it
might be the Seon
expression of the idea
that in Zen is said
"shoshin", often
translated as
"beginner's mind" but

also carrying notions
conveyed by translating
it as
"original mind", "naive
mind", "novice mind",
and "inexperienced
mind" (noting that
the character
rendered "mind" is
better translated as
"heart-mind"). There's
also a
beloved koan often
called "not knowing is

most intimate" (Book of
Equanimity, Case
20), and "don't know" is
a good name to put to a
particular insight you
might have if
you meditate enough.
Regardless, "don't know
mind" is a thing Zen
practitioners
sometimes say. What
does it mean?
Depends on how you
parse it.

The standard parsing is
as "don't-know mind",
as in the mind that
doesn't know. This
fifits with the notion
of soshin or beginner's
mind, that is the mind
that has not yet
made itself up. In
standard rationalist
terms, this is the
heart-mind that is
curious,
relinquishing, light,
even, simple, humble,

and nameless. Saying
"don't know" is tricky,
though, because
there's the looming
trap of the "don't
know" that stops
curiosity.
Instead, this is the
"don't know" that
extends an open
invitation of learn more.
You can also parse it as
a command: "do not
know" (since Zen falls
within the

Buddhist tradition that
claims all you know is
mind, "mind" is
redundant here). This
isn't an imperative to
never know anything.
Rather it's an
encouragement to gaze
beyond form into
emptiness since our
minds are often caught
up in form (the map)
and fail to leave space
for emptiness (the
territory[1]). More

specififically, to know
is to
make distinctions, to
construct an abstraction,
to prune, to have a pior
over your
observations, to give
something a name, to say
this not that.
Naturally, this means
knowing is quite useful;
it's literally what
enables us to do
things[2]. Yet it
necessarily

means leaving something
out. "Don't know mind"
is then advice to
simultaneously let
all in even as you keep
some out.
Thus both
interpretations
converge on this idea
that we can open
ourselves to
"knowing" more if we
can hold fast to the
realization that we

don't already know it
all.
1. If I'm being more
careful, the duals of
form and emptiness and
map and territory
don't perfectly align,
map and territory being
more akin to the
phenomena/noumena or
ontological/ontic split
in Western philosophy.
Nevertheless I think
this is a good enough

comparison to get the
idea given the
broader ways we
sometimes talk about
map and territory on LW.
↩
2. By "do things" and
specififically "things"
I'm here talking about
things-as-things,
that is things as
reififications of the
territory in the map,
since properly things

only exist in the map,
not the territory, since
without the map there
is no
thinginess, only a soup
of stuffff. ↩

Zen and
Rationali
ty: Trust
in Mind

Thisispost2/?about
theintersectionofmy
decadesofLW-style
rationalitypractice

andmyseveralyearsof
Zenpractice.
Intoday'sinstallment,I
lookat"trustinmind"
fromarationalist
perspective.
I really like Trustin
Mind, a Zen teaching
poem attributed to the
Third Patriarch,
because it offffers a
vivid description of Zen
practice that I've kept
coming back to for

new guidance and insight.
Today I only want to
talk about its origin and
its title,
because to delve in
much more would be to
write a book on Zen.
Purportedly it was
written in response to
the rising popularity of
Pure Land Buddhism
in an attempt to
encourage the people to
practice the "true"
Buddha way, and

revolves around the
idea of putting trust in
mind rather than trust,
as in the case of
Pure Land Buddhism, in
a deifified Buddha
that will lead people to
the Pure Land if you
chant his name. This
seems a deeply
humanist message, and
from a certain
perspective this is fair:
Zen contains a strong

humanist aspect in that
it's all about
doing the practice here
and now, and who else is
there to do the
practice but you, a
human? But this is
where the cracks in the
humanist interpretation
start to show,
because Zen will
immediately turn
around and ask "oh, so
where's this 'you'
that's

doing the practice?" and
"does a dog have
Buddha-nature?".
Zen's tricky like that,
offffering you
something with one hand
while pulling the rug
out from under you
with
the other, repeatedly
trying to get you to
look up and see what
you've been leaving
out.

Turning to the title,
the "mind" here is again
the heart-mind or
heart-body-mind. This
is an idea that comes up
a lot in Zen, so it's
worth saying a bit about
it. Partly it
reflflects the
traditional idea that a
person's emotions or
soul reside in their
heart
rather than their head,
and the use of shin/⼼

to mean heart and mind
is common in
classical Chinese writing,
not just in Zen/Ch'an
texts. But if we're
charitable and ask
why would someone
without the benefifit
of modern medicine
think an import part of
themselves resided in
the heart, I reckon it's
deeply related to the
way we talk about

feelingour emotions.
That is, most people
report experiencing
emotions and
sometimes general
thought somatically, i.e.
in the body. Sometimes
this ability to
literally feel emotions
is impaired, and even
when it's not we can get
better at it
through focusing on the
mind-body-"heart"

connection, and Zen
sees this as vital to
its project because it's
a key part of studying
the self to forget the
self.
The other key word in
the title that I've
rendered here as
"trust" can also be and
frequently is
translated as "faith".
Now, I've buried that
down here in the
middle of the

post for a couple
reasons. One,
rationalists and secular
folks in general,
including my
past self, are often
allergic to the word
"faith" because of the
way it's used by
Christians, especially
evangelical Christians,
and I didn't want to put
people offff before
they had a chance to
read any of this. Two, I

think the "trust"
translation is more
likely
to resonate with
rationalists; that was
certainly the case for
me. In fact, use of the
word "faith" in
spiritual jargon only
started to really mean
something to me after I
came to develop some
trust in mind! But just
what is this trust-
faith?

A good way start to see
trust-faith is to look
on the "small" end
where reductionism
bottoms out into
epistemic circularity
and makes us choose
between consistency and
completeness. Much to
my surprise, while
writing this I learned
even
Eliezeracknowledges
the need for faith of
this type, though as of

the time of writing
that
linked article he seems
to have still held out
positivist hopes.
Regardless, it's the
kind
of trust you put in the
axioms of a system; the
unconditional
acceptance you must
grant to the smallest
atoms of your ontology
to which you can reduce
all else but are

themselves irreducible;
the monumental
importance you place on
selecting the base
types out of which you
build your models. It's
the leap across the
epistemological
chasm to the side of
pragmatism and winning
instead of infifinite
skepticism and
solipsism.
Once on that other side,
you can explore the

"big" end of trust-
faith. This is the kind
of
trust in knowing that
you know nothing, in
dealing with unknown
unknowns, in being
okay with the truth,
and the kind of faith
required to leave space
for the "don't know"
that I talked about last
time. It's "knowing" the
nameless virtue with
your bones, and

the utter acceptance
of the Litany of Tarski
and the Litany of
Gendlin. For me, Alan
Watts put it best when
he wrote:
Belief, as I use the
word here, is the
insistence that the
truth is what one
would
“lief” or wish it to be.
The believer will open
his mind to the truth
on the condition

that it fifits in with
his preconceived ideas
and wishes. Faith, on
the other hand, is
an unreserved opening
of the mind to the
truth, whatever it may
turn out to be.
Faith has no
preconceptions; it is a
plunge into the
unknown. Belief clings,
but
faith lets go. In this
sense of the word,

faith is the essential
virtue of science, and
likewise of any religion
that is not self-
deception.
When I fifirst heard
that quote, it
reframed "faith" for
me in a way I could feel
comfortable using it. I
think of it as similar to
the reframing
Bayesianism gave me on
"belief", a word I had
previously avoided using

at all cost because of
the way
Christians around me
growing up used it to
mean blind acceptance
of specifific facts
because their religion
told them to. So just as
we need not abandon
"belief" because
some people with anti-
rational epistemics use
it as a stopping word, we
need not

abandon "faith" either,
even if "trust" is
perhaps a more
serviceable synonym.
And at that I'll leave
offff, although we're
not actually done with
unpacking "trust in
mind" because we've
only looked at a sliver
of what "mind" really
means in Zen, but
we had to get through
trust-faith today, and

I think it's a lot on its
own. I'm sure,
though, I'll fifind my
way to saying more about
it if I keep this series
up.

Zen and
Rationalit
y: Map and
Territory

Thisispost3/?about

andmyseveralyearsof
Zenpractice.

Intoday'sinstallment,I
lookatformand
emptinessfroma
rationalistperspective.
Rationalists have a few
key ideas or memes (in
the memetic sense), and
one of them
is "the map is not the
territory". Lots has
been written about this
idea on LessWrong,
but it's an idea with a
history that stretches

back for thousands of
years, so it's
perhaps not surprising
that it's also one of
the ideas at the core
of Zen.
But in Zen we don't use
the words "map" and
"territory", instead
preferring numerous
other metaphors to
point at this distinction.
Let's explore a few of
them, because each

elucidates a
difffferent aspect of
the truth pointed at by
these duals.
Before Zen was Zen,
Nagarjuna formalized
this idea that there's a
duality between
map and territory in
the two truths
doctrine. He called
these two pairs form
and
emptiness, pointing at
the way our minds put

our experiences
together into forms or
objects that are fifixed,
at least in our minds,
yet ultimately reality
is empty of these
forms or any other kind
of inherent distinctions,
essences, or ultimate
and timeless
truths. Everything we
know is provisional,
taking a skeptical
epistemic stance similar
to Pyrrhonism.

Form and emptiness
have their place in Zen,
but more common is to
make a
distinction between the
relative and the
absolute. The relative
is that which changes,
which exists in our
minds, which comes and
goes. The absolute is
that which exists
prior to our perception
of it; it's the space in

which the relative
arises. But Zen doesn't
stop there. Form is
emptiness and emptiness
is form, as the Heart
Sutra says, and the
relative and the
absolute can be thought
of as dancing reality
into existence,
simultaneously
unifified and separate.
Dongshan (Japanese:
Tozan) explored this in
his

poem on the Five Ranks,
a subtle teaching that
can take some effffort
to penetrate but
is worth the effffort.
Talking about relative
and absolute can get a
bit abstract, as can
talking about form
and emptiness, so
there's another pair
that's been used
extensively in Zen
teaching

that, alas, holds little
currency for us
Westerners: guest and
host, or alternatively
vassal and lord. I don't
have much to say on
these because they
mostly make sense in
the context of the
pre-colonial Sinosphere,
but I mention them in
case the metaphor
resonates with you.
For Westerners, I think
our philosophical

traditions offffer
some alternatives. Kant
offffers
us phenomena and
noumena, which sadly
misses the mark a bit as
often understood
by assigning essential
form to the
territory/emptiness/ab
solute by suggesting
there
are things-in-themself
than nonetheless have

thingness. Better are
Heidegger's
ontological and ontic,
which are just fancy
Greek words for
something like "words
or
ideas about what is" and
"that which is",
respectively. Although
even "that which is" is
a bit too much to
describe the ontic;
better to say the ontic

is the "is" or "being" or
"to
be". Put another way,
ontology is like the
nouns, and the ontic is
like the verbs just on
their own, without
even a distinction
between one verb and
another.An analogy I
like that I borrow from
topology is to liken the
map/form/ontology to
closed sets and the
territory/emptiness/on

tic to open sets. This is
by no means perfect
and if you think about
it too hard it falls
apart, but using my
intuitions about closed
and open sets helped
me make better sense
of the two truths, so I
share it with you in
that spirit.
And at that I'll end
this post. I've not said
much about the actual
relationship between

the two truths of map
and territory or how
their dependence on
one another creates
reality as we
experience it. I'll
tantalizingly hint that
ideas about embedded
agency go
a long way towards
exploring how the two
truths play together,
but exploration of that
I'll save for another
time.

Zen and
Rationality:
Just This Is
It

Thisispost4/?about
theintersectionofmy
decadesofLW-style
rationalitypractice
andmyseveralyearsof
Zenpractice.

Intoday'sinstallment,I
lookat"justthisisit"
fromarationalist
perspective.
When Dongshan, the co-
founder of what would
become the Soto Zen
school within
which I practice, was
preparing to leave his
teacher Yunyan and go
out in the world,
he asked Yunyan how he
might summarize his

teaching. Yunyan
replied, "just this [is
it]". Because the more
we say the more we
move into the world of
words and away
from reality as it is on
its own prior to
conception, this is often
shorted in various ways
to "just this" or "just
is" or "this is" or "it is"
or, perhaps best of all
short of saying

nothing and letting
reality stand on its own,
"is".
This is arguably the
core teaching of Soto
Zen and maybe all of
Buddhism, to perceive
and accept reality just
as it is. Yet I see it all
over the place in the
LessWrong corpus,
too. I'll mention a few
of these.
Egan's Law posits that
"it all adds up to

normality". In "A
Technical Explanation
of
Technical Explanation",
Eliezer phrased a
similar sentiment as
"since the beginning,
not one unusual thing
has ever happened".
Both point at the way
that reality is just as
it is, and the only way
we can be confused or
surprised is because we
had an idea

about how reality is
rather than simply
looking and seeing how it
is.
I think this is a hard
thing to remember,
because to the kind of
people that are
attracted to Less Wrong,
better models of
reality are very
attractive. I know they
are
to me! Yet it's very
easy to go from

accepting reality as it is
and trying to better
predict it to getting
lost in the model that
does the predicting and
confusing it for the
real thing. Thus, while
at the same time we
look for models with
better gears that
more precisely carve
reality at its joints, we
also have to remember
those boundaries

are fuzzy and that all
models are ultimately
wrong even and
especially when they
are
useful. It's perhaps
the great koan of Less
Wrong to build better
models while
simultaneously
accepting that all
models are somewhere
wrong.
To help us deal with
this koan, we have a

poem to help us. You
might think I mean the
Litany of Tarski, but
you would be wrong,
because that poem is
about having beliefs
correspond to reality,
but "just this is it" is
all about getting under
those beliefs and
just seeing what's
actually being
perceived. For that, we
turn to the Litany of
Gendlin:

What is true is already
so.
Owning up to it doesn’t
make it worse.
Not being open about it
doesn’t make it go away.
And because it’s true,
it is what is there to be
interacted with.
Anything untrue isn’t
there to be lived.
People can stand what is
true,
for they are already
enduring it.

This was said by Eugene
Gendlin of Focusing
fame, a technique for
helping you
reconnect to your
perceptions just as they
are without judgement
or modeling. The
method is simple, yet
its impact can be
profound for many to
get out of their ideas
about how things are
and to get back to what

evidence they are
actually getting about
the world. Zen asks us
to over and over again
come back to this
fundamental pointthat
reality is just as we
perceive it, not what
we believe about it, and
that belief is
just a useful mechanism
for helping us better
live our lives, if only
we don't get

tripped up into
mistaking the map for
the territory.
Finally, to return to
"A Technical
Explanation of
Technical Explanation",
it contains one
other phrase that
neatly captures the
spirit of "just this":
"joy in the merely
real". If we
can take joy in what
actually is, if that can

be enough for us, then
all else becomes the
playground in which we
live our lives.

Zen and
Rationality:
Skillful
Means

Thisispost5/?about
theintersectionofmy

decadesofLW-style
rationalitypractice
andmyseveralyearsof
Zenpractice.
Intoday'sinstallment,I
lookatskillfulmeans
fromarationalist
perspective.
As part of Zen practice,
a teacher may use or
encourage the use of
many skillful
means. Sometimes called
expedient means or

upaya, these may
include things like
encouraging a student
to take up a particular
meditation practice like
breath counting
or labeling, assigning a
koan, or giving the
student a job within
the Zen center, like
alter care or bell
ringing. These are
meant to aid the
student in their
practice of the

way.
Importantly, the idea
behind these means
being "skillful" or
"expedient" is that
they
are not necessarily
practices a student will
continue with forever,
but rather things the
student should do now
that will help them.
What may be useful for
one student to do

may not be useful for
another, and what was
once a useful practice
for a student may
later become a
hindrance.
A good example is
structured meditation
practices, like breath
counting. When a
student begins
meditating, they might
fifind it very
diffiffifficult to stay
seated for 30

minutes, even during
timed meditation periods
sitting with other
people in a zendo.
Giving them something to
do, like counting their
breath, gives them
something to
focus on and distract
the part of their mind
that wants to get up
and do anything else.
Over hundreds of
hours, they'll retrain

themselves to be able
to stay seated even
when distracted by
gathering evidence that
they can do it, and
slowly the breath
counting will stop being
a skillful means to
help them practice and
will instead
become a hindrance and
a distraction from just
sitting, at which point
they might

move towards a
difffferent, less
structured meditation
practice or spend less
of the time
in meditation counting
breaths. If they kept
counting their breath
for years even after
it was no longer
necessary to get them
through a sitting period,
it would no longer be
a skillful use of the
means, but as long as

the alternative would
be failing to keep
sitting so they have the
chance to develop skills
that will let them
meditate more full
heartedly, it remains
skillful.
Rationality has its own
version of skillful
means via the practice
of instrumental
rationality, or
systematically achieving
one's ends. It's the art

of fifinding ways to
help
one become stronger. It
recognizes that you
can't go straight to the
ideal and convert
oneself into a perfect
Bayesian reasoner with
infifinite memory and
thinking capacity,
but instead must work
with your fallible,
human self to fifind
tools and techniques
that

help you where you are
now to get you
incrementally closer to
where you want to be.
It also recognizes that
sometimes the skillful
next step actually
makes you temporarily
worse offff as you
climb down the hill of a
local maxima to move to
a difffferent, higher
local maxima.
If you want to practice
these skillful means,

the CFAR handbook is a
decent starting
point for learning some
of them, and a CFAR
workshop is maybe an
even better
option. Further, many
of the posts tagged
Practical(2031) contain
useful techniques to
aid you in achieving your
goals, as do posts tagged
Rationality under the
"Applied

Topics" and
"Techniques" groups of
tags.There's even some
impressive overlap
between rationalist and
Zen skillful means. For
example, there's the
general act of noticing,
be it noticing confusion
or anything else,
that's essential for
studying the self in
enough detail to work
with it (and in Zen, to

eventually forget it).
There's trying things
(famously Zen teachers
may tell their
student not to bother
understanding
something, but just to
do it and see what
happens). And focusing
is, from a Zen
perspective, one more
useful means to
reintegrating the
heart-mind-body.

Importantly, both
rationality and Zen
acknowledge some
version of the typical
mind
fallacy , carrying the
realization that what's
best for one person now
is not necessarily
what's best for them
later, and that what
works for one person
may not work for

Zen and
Rationalit

Karma is one of those
ideas that is poorly
understood both
because it means
difffferent
things in difffferent
contexts and because
there's a simple but bad
abstraction of the
idea that's easily
understood and shared

but points to something
other than what we
mean by "karma" in Zen,
thus leading to bucket
errors.
So, fifirst, what is
karma not. The Zen
notion of karma is not
any of the related
ideas
also called "karma"
present in other
dharmic traditions. It's
also not the New Age or

Theosophy notion of
karma. All of these you
are probably familiar
with and might be
expressed in one of the
following ways:
what you give is what
you get
the world will punish
you for your bad acts
and reward you for
your good acts
you'll be
rewarded/punished in
proportion to your acts

in this life via the
quality
of your rebirth into a
next life
karma is a "sin debt"
you carry forward,
possibly from past lives,
that you must
work offff to have a
better life
In Zen (and some other
Buddhist traditions),
karma is nothing so
involved. Instead,

you can just read it as
"causality" and you'll
be 80% of the way of
understanding it,
with the remaining 20%
some subtlety around
how causal relationships
relate to the
fundamental flflowing
of one moment into the
next that come from
understanding how
map and territory
relate.

As you might guess, the
other notions of karma
relate to this one as
heuristics about
how earlier moments
affffect later ones.
For example, the
thread of moments out
of
which a person can be
identifified contain
within them all the
causes of the person's
present condition, and
it's often true that if

you behave prosocially
towards others
they'll behave
prosocially towards you,
so a reasonable
compression of karma
that
skips all the fifiner
points look a lot like
"if you do good stuffff,
good stuffff will
happen to
you; if you do bad
stuffff, bad stuffff

will happen to you". Mix
in some beliefs about
reincarnation and you
have karma as it is
commonly encountered,
bucket errors and
all.

Zen and
Rationality:
Continuous
Practice

lookatcontinuous

rationalistperspective.
In Zen there is a focus
on continuous practice
(gyojidokanin Japanese).
The idea has

some subtlety lost in
translation: it's
referencing practice of
the Buddha Way that is
maintained, preserved,
sustained, ceaseless,
and persevered
through (likened to
the
need to continually
sharpen a frequently
used blade against a
grinding stone) in a ring
or cycle of ongoing
change (this is both

talking directly about
the reality of practice
and an allusion to the
wheel of life).
Two common ways this
shows up in Zen is as
both an emphasis on
continuing to train
the same thing over and
over because it's
through doing "the same
thing" that we
come to realize
impermanence, and a

focus on maintaining
one's practice after
various "attainments"
like kensho or
enlightenment. The big
idea here is that one is
never really done
learning and developing,
so continual training
and practice is
necessary to prevent
sliding into greater
delusion. As a
translation of the

Bodhisattva's Vow puts
it: "dharma gates are
boundless, I vow to
enter them".
Although rationality
seeks somewhat
difffferent purposes
than Zen, I think we
fifind a
similar current of
thought running
through rationalist
writing, urging
rationalists to

continually practice the
art. Some examples:
Scott Alexander wrote
that rationality is a
habit to be cultivated.
As such,
cultivation of that
habit requires ongoing
work, which he
captured with the
phrase " constant
vigilance ".
OODA loops are a
technique for
continuously

reassessing a situation
and
updating one's response
to it. They can be
generalized to operate
over difffferent
scales.
Many rationalists refer
to themselves as
"aspiring rationalists" in
order to make
clear that they
haven't achieved the
goal of being rational,
but are instead

always working at it.
And I think there's
something in the ethos
of rationality itself
that suggests
continuous
practice. The idea that
rationality is
systematized winning
carries with it the idea
that
winning, whatever that
means for you, requires
ongoing effffort to
actually use the

system—the moment you
stop putting in the work
to reckon things is the
moment you
stop winning, even if
only marginally. It's
only through continuous
application of effffort
that one can succeed,
at least for a moment,
at winning.

Zen and
Rationality:
Equanimity

lookatequanimityfrom

arationalist
perspective.
In Zen in particular and
various Buddhist
lineages in general
there's a lot of talk
about
equanimity. Sometimes it
refers to a particular
meditative state, other
times to a more
general virtue of
meeting the world on
equal footing with no

particular
preconceptions
about what one will
believe.
It has a so-called near
enemy, though, which is
indifffference, and
this is central to the
straw stereotype of
the advanced Buddhist
practitioner you've
likely encountered.
Think of the
unflflappable monk who
continues to meditate

while the building
burns
down around them, or
more likely the idea
that through meditation
you should
become a person who can
suppress their
emotional responses and
never smile, frown,
laugh, or cry no matter
what the world throws
at you. I don't know
much about
