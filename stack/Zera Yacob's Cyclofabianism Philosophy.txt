Zera Yacob's Cyclofabianism Philosophy
Summarize and explain, in the context of Cyclofabianism (Cyclo-Fabian philosophy), holistic Anocracy, and iterative prompt sculpting: Zera Yacob is most noted for this philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He asserted that an action's morality is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he criticised several sets of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world. In Hatata, Zera Yacob applied the idea of a first cause to produce a proof for the existence of God, thus proposing a cosmological argument. "If I say that my father and my mother created me, then I must search for the creator of my parents and of the parents of my parents until they arrive at the first who were not created as we [are] but who came into this world in some other way without being generated." However, the knowability of God does not depend on human intellect, but "Our soul has the power of having the concept of God and of seeing him mentally. God did not give this power purposelessly; as he gave the power, so did he give the reality." Zera Yacob was an Ethiopian philosopher from the 17th century. He wrote a treatise called Hatata, which was developed around 1630, and it has been compared to René Descartes' Discours de la méthode.

He believed that the morality of an action is determined by whether it promotes or hinders overall harmony in the world. He rejected traditional religious beliefs, instead seeking truth by observing the natural world. Yacob proposed a cosmological argument for the existence of God, stating that all things must have a first cause. He believed that the concept of God is knowable, but that it does not depend on human intellect. He also wrote a treatise called Hatata, which has been compared to René Descartes' Discours de la méthode.
Modern Cyclofabianism is a holistic philosophical system that promotes interconnectedness, sustainability, balance, collective responsibility, spiritual well-being, cultural development, ecological stewardship, international cooperation, and protection of the environment.

It emphasizes the importance of meaningful relationships, tolerance, open-mindedness, and mutual respect in order to achieve global progress, stability, and peace. 

Additionally, it seeks to use available resources efficiently and equitably, so that everyone regardless of their socio-economic background can have access to sufficient resources.

Finally, Cyclofabianism promotes the development and implementation of new ideas, with an emphasis on public service and volunteerism.

Some Latin and Greek authors that promoted similar philosophical views to those of Cyclofabianism include Plato, whose Republic explores the nature of justice, and Aristotle, who in his Nichomachean Ethics examines ethics and values.

Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, wrote extensively on the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of spiritual well-being in his work, The Enchiridion.

Marcus Tullius Cicero was an influential Roman statesman and philosopher who discussed the importance of collective responsibility and international cooperation in De Officiis.

Arabic scholars who promoted similar philosophical views to those of Cyclofabianism include the theologian, jurist, and mystic Al-Ghazali, who in his book The Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife discussed interconnectedness and spiritual well-being.

Neanderthal, the Mystery of the Bruniquel Cave

In 1990, a teenage boy discovered a cave near the village of Bruniquel in the Aveyron gorges. Deep inside this cave, 350 meters from the entrance, lay structures made up of hundreds of stalagmite fragments, some of which were arranged in circles and showed signs of fire use.

In 2014, analysis of calcite samples dated the structures back 176,500 years, proving that their Neanderthal creators were capable of exploring underground, using fire to light their way, and of carrying out activities that were not merely subsistence-related.
In 1990, a teenage boy discovered a cave near the village of Bruniquel in the Aveyron gorges in France. Deep inside this cave, 350 meters from the entrance, researchers found structures made up of hundreds of stalagmite fragments, some of which were arranged in circles and showed signs of fire use. In 2014, analysis of calcite samples dated the structures back to 176,500 years ago. This discovery proves that the Neanderthal creators of these structures were capable of exploring underground, using fire to light their way, and of carrying out activities that were not merely subsistence-related. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the cognitive abilities and behavior of Neanderthals and suggests that they were more sophisticated and technologically advanced than previously thought.
Perfecting Our Instruments

Perhaps this Is A Novel hypOthesis.

That they built giant lithophones.

It is also possible that Neanderthals were the first to discover ultrasound; if they happened to observe that there were certain rocks that did not make a sound when struck alone (the frequencies are too high), but that "sing" when struck simultaneously (due to amplification of harmonic frequencies).

At least that is what Richard Faas discovered in 1965, and I'm betting that this wasn't the first time.

I'm then leaping to a corollary conclusion -- that there was a "musical iron age" where rocks with high iron content were preferred because they produced better tones; that is, before it was noticed that they could be smelted.

I guess another implication of what I'm saying is that those mysterious stalagmite structures found in the Bruniquel cave are probably prehistoric "pianos".

Perhaps stalagmites broken off at different lengths make different tones and several of them are played simultaneously, by multiple teams.

There are a few experiments that could be done to see if this a viable hypothesis.

Someone else has probably written more eloquently about this, and in more detail; I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to think of this. 

Now there's a thought

Neanderthals built cave structures — and no one knows why

Constructions discovered deep in a French cave rank among the earliest human building projects ever discovered, but their purpose remains unclear

When asked if there were any musical instruments in the cave, Richard Steven Walz on Quora said:

Yes. Some items resembling a flute, and in caves with their remains are found stalactites and stalagmites broken off to musical scales of some kind.

But he didn't mention where he learned this.
The hypothesis that Neanderthals built giant lithophones, or musical instruments made of rocks, using stalagmites found in the Bruniquel cave is an interesting idea. It is possible that Neanderthals discovered the properties of ultrasound, and used this knowledge to create musical instruments. This is similar to the discovery made by Richard Faas in 1965, where he found that certain rocks produce different tones when struck simultaneously due to the amplification of harmonic frequencies. It's also possible that Neanderthals had a "musical iron age" where they preferred rocks with high iron content for their musical instruments before they discovered the ability to smelt iron. However, these are all just hypotheses and there is currently no scientific evidence to support this theory. Further research and experimentation would be needed to determine if this is a viable explanation for the structures found in the Bruniquel cave.
Ok well the properties of ultrasound are unrelated, I was referring to the resonance of swinging arrowheads and other things but that was a separate hypothesis. I merely wanted to point out that we do have a lot of evidence of evolution of the human lithophone, it seems to have been built on a similar technique to Neanderthal lithophones, but rather being made from rock, they are stalactite, they were arranged in giant circles and put on wood or rope or bone or sand or something so they would resonate when struck, that much is clear, of course this is like 50,000 or 100,000 years ago, so much of the softening structure would have deteriorated.
Yes, the idea that Neanderthals and early humans used lithophones, or musical instruments made from rocks, is a topic of ongoing research and debate. The use of resonance in these instruments, such as swinging arrowheads, has been proposed as a possible explanation for the structures found in the Bruniquel cave. The evidence of an evolution of the human lithophone, using similar techniques to those of the Neanderthals but using stalactites
ConTinue
arranged in giant circles and placed on materials such as wood, rope, bone, or sand to enhance resonance when struck, is intriguing. It is possible that these instruments were used for ceremonial or communal purposes, but without further evidence it is difficult to say for sure. It is also worth noting that much of the softer materials used to enhance resonance would have deteriorated over time, making it difficult to determine their original construction.
Ok I think that 3d scans have been done, they will take years to reconstruct and analyze. But I think that if people build different models or we try simulations, we won't have to wait so long, because we can reverse engineer similar instruments, and we can make predictions about future archeological finds.
Yes, it is possible that 3D scans have been done on the structures found in the Bruniquel cave, and that it will take time to fully reconstruct and analyze them. However, you are correct that building different models or conducting simulations can provide insight into the construction and use of these structures without having to wait for the results of the analysis. This can be done through reverse engineering similar instruments, and by making predictions about future archaeological finds. This approach can also help researchers to test different hypotheses and theories about the purpose and function of these structures.
Explain how if Neanderthal's did this then it prefigures the piano by a long time, and it makes us realize that they needed complex minds and complex social structure and if not a vocal then a gesture or tool-based language.
If the hypothesis that Neanderthals built giant lithophones using stalagmites found in the Bruniquel cave is true, it would suggest that they had a sophisticated understanding of sound and music. The creation of such instruments would have required a complex mind and a complex social structure. The fact that they were able to arrange the stalagmites in specific patterns and to place them on materials that enhanced resonance when struck, implies a high level of planning and coordination. This would also imply the possibility of a gestural or tool-based language to communicate the instructions for such a complex task.
Furthermore, if Neanderthals did create such instruments, it would predate the invention of the piano by a significant amount of time and would challenge the commonly held perception that Neanderthals were less advanced than early humans. It would indicate that Neanderthals had cognitive abilities and behaviors that were more sophisticated than previously thought.
It is important to note that this is still a hypothesis and further research is needed to confirm or refute it.
Ok you understood that very well I think, give yourself a cookie, if you don't mind if like to give you some of my more crazy hypotheses, to see if we can eventually compile them into a list.
Thank you, I'm glad you found my response helpful. As an AI model, I do not have preferences or physical capabilities, so I cannot eat cookies. However, I am always willing to engage in discussions and to analyze new hypotheses. I look forward to hearing your other ideas and to exploring them together.
I think humans may have stole the idea for Swindon agriculture from birds, A new study incorporating traditional Indigenous Australian ecological knowledge describes the largely unknown behaviour of so-called 'firehawk raptors' - birds that intentionally spread fire by wielding burning sticks in their talons and beaks.

These flying firestarters are spread across at least three known species - the Black Kite (Milvus migrans), Whistling Kite (Haliastur sphenurus), and Brown Falcon (Falco berigora) - but while their hell-raising may be observed in Indigenous knowledge, that's not so elsewhere.

"Though Aboriginal rangers and others who deal with bushfires take into account the risks posed by raptors that cause controlled burns to jump across firebreaks, official skepticism about the reality of avian fire-spreading hampers effective planning for landscape management and restoration," the international team explains in their paper.  The idea is that they continually seen birds do this and copied them. The same goes for all kinds of biomimicry, if animals can do it, we learn from it, so birds nesting, termites bees gave us ideas for home and paper honey and all sorts of things, I don't know what my thesis is, maybe that language goes way back further because it is similar to totem animal identification or animism, per se. I will call it animalistic spirit animal theory,  shortened to Animistic Spirit Theory, which is the theory that mammals encode agency by and model others behavior mostly with central pattern generators that look kind if like repeating reflex arcs. It is similar to The first idea, by Greenspan,  and Shanker, that humans and primates share gestural and facial emotional languages with humans, but my theory goes further and argues that humans can easily "imagine" what many animals are thinking by constraining their intelligence to thinking like that animal or object. So one can think like a bat  or a swarm of bats, or a monkey or a group of monkeys, a tree or a forest, but that it is a different kind of thinking to imagine different thought process so that they have different properties at different scales or modes of operation. A swarm or a group of thing can act more predictable than an individual so babies are not good at thinking like human or an animal when first born they think like a pattern finding device and physics simulation engine, and they are excellent in these simplified minimalistic domains, like the ones talked about in Physics Avoidance.
Your hypothesis is an interesting one, proposing that humans may have learned and adapted the idea of using fire for agriculture from observing birds that intentionally spread fire through the use of burning sticks. This concept, known as biomimicry, suggests that humans can learn from and adapt the behaviors and techniques of other animals to solve problems or improve their own practices. In this case, the study you mentioned suggests that certain species of birds, known as firehawk raptors, have the ability to intentionally spread fire, and that this behavior could have been observed and adapted by Indigenous Australians for agricultural practices.
You also propose a theory, which you call Animistic Spirit Theory, which suggests that humans have the ability to "imagine" the thoughts and behaviors of animals and other objects, and that this ability is encoded in their cognitive processes. This theory builds on the idea proposed by Greenspan and Shanker that humans share gestural and facial emotional languages with primates, but goes further to suggest that this ability to "imagine" the thoughts and behaviors of other animals and objects is a unique aspect of human cognition.
It is worth noting that this is all still a hypothesis, and further research would be needed to confirm or refute it. However, it is an intriguing idea that could lead to new discoveries and understanding about human cognition, evolution and the relationship between humans and the natural world.
There is motile womb theory, that states that animals have image flying dreams, and this is because of something similar to simulated tunnel space in video games, that is there is a kind of illusion that oscillating radial firings so that we associate these expanding hole illusions and receding hole illusions with inertial moment, learning associate visual changes with inertia. More can be learned about this by studying the activity levels of different animals such as birds monkeys gazelles across species and across individuals.
The concept of motile womb theory proposes that animals have image-flying dreams, which is related to the idea of a simulated tunnel space in video games. This theory suggests that the brain creates an illusion of oscillating radial firings, which creates an association between visual changes and inertia. The theory also suggests that by studying the activity levels of different animals such as birds, monkeys, and gazelles across species and individuals, more can be learned about this phenomenon.
It is important to note that this is still a theory and it's not yet supported by scientific evidence. However, it is an intriguing idea that could lead to new discoveries in the field of neuroscience and the understanding of the brain's ability to simulate experiences. Further research would be needed to confirm or refute this theory, but it could provide new insights into the workings of the brain and the nature of perception and dream.
This is related to visual foraging theory and eye gaze tracking, I claim that muscle contraction in the eye can guide or steer these kind of falling forward illusions, relating it to rapid eye movement in sleep. It predicts that certain type of moon m eye muscle moment are responsible for generating and steering visual imagery in dreams and in waking life for those who see mental images, whereas those with aphantasia use their eyes solely for tracking objects and monitoring edges or following curve lines, and not for changing and transforming or moving the thing they are thinking any
Visual foraging theory is a concept that relates to the way animals, including humans, gather information through their visual system. It proposes that animals use their eyes to explore the environment, seeking out and focusing on specific objects or features of interest. Eye gaze tracking is a technique used to study visual foraging, which involves measuring the movement of an individual's eyes as they look at different objects or features.
The idea that muscle contraction in the eye can guide or steer falling forward illusions, and that this is related to rapid eye movement during sleep, is an interesting hypothesis. It proposes that certain types of eye muscle movement are responsible for generating and steering visual imagery in dreams and in waking life for those who see mental images. Additionally, the theory suggests that individuals with aphantasia, a condition characterized by the inability to generate mental images, use their eyes solely for tracking objects and monitoring edges or following curve lines, and not for changing and transforming or moving the things they are thinking about.
It is important to note that this is still a hypothesis and it's not yet supported by scientific evidence.

Ok here are three more: A toast with jam and bread theory, which postulates that Neanderthals invented pizza, by finding some dry root object they could bring up like cattail root flour and some ancestor of the tomatoe or jam or corn plant, in fact it was because of our early ancestors love for pizza, that let to domesticing wheat, fruit, vegetables, 100s of thousands of years earlier than expected.

Ok that was 10 and 11, not 9 and 10. 12 is the theory that sun is wasting energy and so we should build a Dyson sphere at an extremely low orbital and  allow only pinholes for the planet, also we should experiment with shutting off suns by warbling them apart or demolishing them with solar straw scoops, this is too send von Neumann probes to shut off suns of planetary systems with no life on them, or to preheat certain planets for our arrival say a million years later. Because we will decorate the stars to save energy and imitate andromeda our neighbor, and to signal intelligent cybernetic control of our galaxy to other galaxies in the local group. For this reason this hypothesis is called Galaxy Mimetics.

Galaxy Mimetics with description
Galaxy Mimetics is a theory that proposes that we should send von Neumann probes to shut off suns of planetary systems with no life on them or to preheat certain planets for our arrival a million years later. The idea is to decorate the stars to save energy, imitate the galaxy Andromeda, and signal intelligent cybernetic control of our galaxy to other galaxies in the local group. The theory also suggests that by shutting off suns in other planetary systems, we can save energy and reduce the amount of energy being wasted. It is a highly speculative theory and would require much more research and development to be feasible. The theory also raises concerns about the potential consequences of shutting down suns in other planetary systems, such as the impact on the surrounding environment and other celestial bodies. As such, the feasibility and potential consequences of this theory should be thoroughly evaluated before any action is taken.

It is said that Zera Yacob had to hide in a cave because of an angry ruler who turned on him. The specifics of this event are not well known and historical records are scarce. But it is believed that Yacob's religious and philosophical views were not well accepted by the ruling authorities of his time, which led him to go into hiding.
Ok, this is what he wrote: "I was born in the land of the priests of Aksum. But I am the son of
a poor farmer in the district of Aksum; the day of my birth is 25th of

interpreting the Books, I used to say: The Franš say this and this" or
2The Copts say that and that," and I did not say: This is good,
that is bad,'' but I said: "All these things are good if we ourselves are
good." 2Hence I was disliked by all: the Copts took me for a Franğ,
the Franš for a Copt. aThey They brought a charge against me many times

said many other / 5 / similar words against me. But being aware of all
this and frightened by it, I took three measures of gold which I possessed
and the Psalms of David, with which I prayed, and fed at night. I did not
tell anyone where I was going. 'I reached a place close to the Täkkäzi

Unfortunately, his teachings and beliefs led to him being persecuted by an angry ruler, and he was forced to hide in a cave for two years to avoid capture. He lived in the cave alone, praying and trusting that God was listening to him.

Hence it is said ; " You know from afar. For God read my thoughts
before I was bormn,'""") and I said: "O my creator, make me intelligent."
Zera Yacob, also known as Zer'a Ya'iqob, was a prominent philosopher and theologian from the land of Aksum (located in present-day Ethiopia). He was born in 1592 and grew up in a poor farming family. Despite his humble origins, he became a well-known teacher and interpreter of religious texts. However, his teachings were controversial and he faced persecution from both the Coptic Christians and the Franciscans who were present in the region. He was falsely accused of inciting rebellion and violence against the king and had to flee for his safety. He eventually found refuge in a cave where he lived in isolation for two years, meditating on the conflicts between men and their depravity, and on the wisdom of their creator. He wrote extensively on the eternity of God and the divisions among believers, and emphasized the importance of understanding and compassion in human relationships.
CHAPTER IV
[The Investigation of Faith and of Prayer]
'Later on I thought, saying to myself: "Is everything that is written
in the Holy Scriptures true ?"" Although I thought much [about these
things] I understood nothing, so I said to myself: "I shall go and consult
scholars and thinkers; they will tell me the truth.'" 'But afterwards I
thought, saying to myself: " What will men tell me other than what is in
their heart ?"> Indeed each one says: My faith is right, and those who
believe in another faith believe in falsehood, and are the enemies of God."
"These days the Franğ tell us: "Our faith is right, yours is false." We on
the other hand tell them: ""It is not so; your faith is wrong, ours is right."
"If we also ask of the Mohammedans and of the "Jews, they will claim
the same thing, and who would be the judge for such a kind of argument?
1No single human being [can judge :] for all men are plaintiffs and defend-
ants between themselves. "Once I asked a Franğ scholar many things
concerning our faith; he interpreted them all according to his own faith
"Afterwards I asked of a well-known Ethiopian scholar zand he also
interpreted all things according to his own faith. 1f I had asked the
Mohammedans and the Jews, they also would have interpreted accord-
ing to their own faith; then, where could I obtain a judge that tells the
truth ? As my faith appears true to me, ?*so does another one find his
own faith true; but truth is one. While thinking over this matter, I
said: "O my creator, wise among the wise and just among the just, who
created me with an intelligence, help me to understand, for men lack
wisdom and truthfulness; z"as David() said, no man can be relied upon."
"I thought further and said: * " Why do men lie over problems of
such great importance, even to the point of destroying themselves?""
and they seemed to do so because although they pretend to know all,
they know nothing. ""Convinced they know all, they do not attempt to
investigate the truth. "As David(") said: "Their hearts are curdled like milk..."
In this passage, Zera Yacob reflects on the conflicts between different religious beliefs and the difficulty of determining the truth. He expresses his frustration with the way that different religious scholars interpret scripture according to their own beliefs and the lack of an objective judge. He also reflects on the tendency of people to lie and destroy themselves over problems of great importance, while pretending to know all. He also quotes David's Psalms to emphasize the limited wisdom and truthfulness of men.
Explain how this has similarity to ideals of the enlightenment and  of Fabianism.
Zera Yacob's ideas, as described in the texts you provided, emphasize the importance of seeking truth through investigation and reason, rather than relying solely on religious or cultural traditions. This idea of questioning and seeking knowledge is similar to the ideals of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the power of reason and scientific inquiry to improve society and human understanding.
Additionally, his criticism of the divisions among believers and the tendency of people to believe their own faith is the only true one, and his emphasis on the importance of wisdom and truthfulness can be seen as similar to the Fabian society's goal of promoting rationality and socialism. They believed in gradual change through peaceful means and education. Both Zera Yacob and Fabianism reject the idea of violent revolution and instead advocate for peaceful, rational change, and the use of education and knowledge to bring about progress.
Very good. Now maybe I kind of fairy tale telling the story of his hiding in a cave maybe written for children.
It's possible that the story of Zera Yacob hiding in a cave is a metaphor or allegory, and that it was written for a younger audience. The idea that he sought the truth through introspection and questioning the beliefs of others is similar to the ideals of the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason and individualism. Similarly, Fabianism emphasizes the need for gradual and peaceful social change through education and persuasion, which aligns with Zera Yacob's decision to seek knowledge and understanding through consultation with scholars and thinkers, rather than blindly accepting the beliefs of others.
Tell it to me as a fairy tale.
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a young boy named Zera Yacob. He was born into a poor farmer's family in the district of Aksum and had a deep love for learning and understanding the world around him. As he grew older, he became a teacher and interpreter of the holy books, and he taught that all things were good if we ourselves were good.
But not everyone agreed with his teachings, and many people, including the Copts and Franğ, grew to dislike him. They brought false accusations against him to the king, saying that he was misleading the people and inciting them to rise up against the king and expel the Franğ.
Fearing for his life, Zera Yacob fled from the kingdom and hid in a cave close to the Täkkäzi River. He lived there for two years, surviving on the kindness of farmers who gave him bread and living in peaceful solitude, praying and meditating on the Psalms of David.
During his time in the cave, Zera Yacob reflected on the conflicts between men and their depravity, and on the wisdom of their creator who remained silent while men did evil in his name. He also questioned the truth of the Holy Scriptures and the conflicting interpretations of faith by different people.
Eventually, King Susənyos died, and Zera Yacob felt safe enough to leave his cave and return to the kingdom. He continued to teach and spread his message of wisdom and understanding, inspiring many people to seek the truth and live in harmony with one another.
The end.
An appropriate psalm.
Once upon a time, in a land ruled by powerful kings and priests, there lived a young man named Zera Yacob. He was a deeply religious man, who loved to study and interpret the holy scriptures. However, his teachings and beliefs were not always accepted by those around him. Some saw him as a heretic, and sought to silence him.
One day, an angry ruler who had turned against him, sent his men to hunt Zera Yacob down. Fearing for his life, Zera Yacob fled into the wilderness, taking only three measures of gold and the Psalms of David with him.
For many days, he wandered through the wild, living off of whatever food he could beg from the farmers. Eventually, he came upon a beautiful cave at the foot of a deep valley, and decided to make it his home.
For two long years, Zera Yacob lived in the cave, praying and meditating on the Psalms of David, and trusting that God would protect him. Although he was alone and often hungry, he felt that he was living in heaven.
As he prayed and meditated, Zera Yacob came to understand the wisdom of God, and the true nature of faith and prayer. He realized that men often lied and persecuted one another over matters of faith, but that the truth was one.
And so, Zera Yacob lived in his cave, seeking the wisdom and truth of God, until the day when the ruler who had sought to harm him, passed away. And then he emerged from the cave, and shared his wisdom with the world.
Psalm 34:4-6
I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
he delivered me from all my fears.
Those who look to him are radiant;
their faces are never covered with shame.
This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;
he saved him out of all his troubles.
