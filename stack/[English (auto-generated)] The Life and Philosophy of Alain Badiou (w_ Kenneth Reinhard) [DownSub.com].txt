in this episode rather than implying

that a kind of a truth if you will that

is historical that's specific to a

location a time that could be true in

one place but not really true in another

Badu's model of Truth is really much

more based on mathematics the idea of a

mathematical truth if you will is

something that is not relative in any

way it is eternal um the truths that uid

articulated are still true today even if

they don't explain as much of the world

as we as we now know there is if you

will right nevertheless they are they

have an absolute truth to them and his

methods of understanding how to reach a

truth are absolute they're not simply we

can say you know that was ancient Greece

and now we have different different

ideas well yes we have new ideas we have

other ideas but that didn't make them

any less Universal there was nothing

specific to one place or time about that

kind of a truth and so mathematical

truths really become more paradigmatic

than other types of truths if you will

or knowledge which is the the opposition

that bedu will finally make the truths

have to be distinguished from knowledge

a truth isn't something that we

simply understand as

um something we know and we know for

sure that has a kind of a certainty and

a and a you know an establish to it a

truth is something that we produce that

we bring into the world that if you will

is the underlying truth of a world and

this gets back to the question of the

universal because it's generic to the

world it's part of a generic something

which is not specific to any particular

part but is ubiquitous is part of the

whole is is is indiscriminately

distributed among you know across the

world right so a truth is something that

is on the one hand imminent to a world

and reveals something about the world

the contradictions that inform that

world and by revealing it it's a way to

bring something new into the world

something which is not coming from

outside but precisely from that internal

unseen but everywhere present

contradiction or

singularities or IND discernability

something that doesn't register to the

to the general encyclopedias of

knowledge the general consensus about

what counts and what really is there and

that's something that is a kind of a

universalism that says that it's not

specific again to a time or a place

right it's there to be found and to be

brought out as something that we've

never seen before right so truth will

surprise us and it's not aimed at

anybody in particular it's aimed

universally so you can't have a truth

that is somehow only about certain

people only counts in certain limited

way ways or um only some people think of

as true there has to be something truly

Universal about a true hey everyone

welcome to this conversation on the

philosophy of Alan Badu with the Badu

scholar Kenneth Reinhard I've had in

mind fatly a year and a half now to do

an episode dedicated just to Alam Badu

um and I was really fortunate to come

across a lecture that Professor Reinhard

gave uh on the fundamental philosophy of

alanu I believe at UCLA and the moment

listen to the lecture I had no doubt

that he is the scholar to speak to as he

beautifully articulates some of the

fundamental tenants of ban philosophy to

be frank I wouldn't say have carefully

and punctiliously worked through the

text of Alan Badu he's one of those

thinkers that's just got a a vast array

of work from from mathematics to

politics to ontology to of course pism

uh but I really was hoping that I'd be

well prepared for this conversation so I

read some of the work Professor

Reinhardt has written on Badu including

in fact his preference to uh volume

three of being an event imminence of

truths and I feel like we did a pretty

good job we covered a lot we covered the

truth conditions the role of philosophy

uh the place of mathematics in bu's

thinking um and what kind of platonist

he is and his reading of PLO uh and also

of course I mean I as I told him there's

no way that I'll not talk about love

when speaking to a bedi and we spoke of

Love My Hope really is for this episode

to be a Prelude to B's thinking and

hopefully be an impetus for to go and

read his Works including his big you

know big event Trilogy I would just add

this a lot from this conversation stood

out to me but one point uh Professor

ranard made which really spoke to me

deeply was that uh maybe this is a

caricature of like home I'm not saying

this the case but this is notion because

of the focus on negativity and lack in

laon's theory of the subject sometimes

one could perhaps view lenan theory in a

a cynical way and here's where I think I

find I'm deeply attracted to Buu as a

thinker because to be honest his

philosophy is quite seductive it it

seduces you into thinking about uh being

about subjectivity in a a lot more

positive way in a lot more productive

way in a more creative way uh and

frankly as put it plainly as Professor

rard put it it makes you happier to do

Philosophy for a lack of a better term

uh and I think there's something there

as much as I deeply appreciate and

almost reveal lenan Theory uh I still

think uh I'm at the end of the day what

I'm interested in is philosophy not

psychoanalysis and but do for me is one

of those philosophers that's really up

there uh as a as a thinker of of

metaphysics and ontology but then having

said that Badu of course perhaps even

famously retains the subject in his

philosophy uh unlike some of his

contemporaries in the French Theory

scene um and I think also not I think I

know this for a fact but who also

seriously takes lon's work into

consideration and even claims that for

you to do any kind of philosophy any

worthwhile philosophy you need to First

go through Lon and I think there's

something there too of course though to

reiterate this was only an introductory

episode to but Doan philosophy and all

the Manisha of how the Liana School

reads like or how B reads like that's

for another day uh but as I said I am

super grateful for Professor Reinhardt

being generous with his time and

knowledge uh and with that being said a

quick PSA as you may know I've mentioned

multiple times I'll never have

advertisers or sponsors on this podcast

frankly I think we live in a society of

success and over consumption and I don't

want to contribute to that by selling

you more things that being said though

Worse live in the world we live in I run

Professor KET Reinhard is research

professor of comparative literature and

English at UCLA where he directed the

Center for Jewish studies and founded

the graduate program in experimental

critical theory he has written on

psychoanalysis philosophy religion and

occasionally literature and Opera he is

a co-author of the neighbor three

inquiries into Political theology with

slav and Eric sner and after edus

Shakespeare in psychoanalysis with Julia

Reinhard Lipton he is the editor and

co-translator of K University press

series of the complete seminars of Alan

Badu and he has has translated several

of Badu's books including the

culmination of his being an event

Trilogy the Eminence of truths with that

being said he has a conversation on the

philosophy of Alan Badu with Professor

Kenneth Reinhard how has it been um

being a translator I mean you've

translated a lot of work by Badu uh I'm

curious what that project entails um and

yeah it's it's quite a feet at least in

my eyes but if just tell us what that

looks you know on a day-to-day basis

well it's it's been a wonderful

experience I have to say really a

lifechanging experience and um it's one

that I've had uh in partnership with

Susan Spitzer um I'm really if you will

the junior member in our translation

team she is by far the better uh speaker

and reader of French and she's a

professional translator and my expertise

is more on the side of philosophy and

the conceptual questions um but it's a

great partnership we work very closely

we send drafts back and

forth um we're very very um per much

perfectionists we really we don't let

things go until we are really happy with

them um we have um at points uh worked

closely with bedu when there were there

were um issues that seemed to really

require his uh his his comments um but

in general he tells us you know you

should decide what you you know my work

whatever you think is right is right um

so um but it's been a wonderful

experience and it's really why I retired

from uh teaching at UCLA is to pursue

this

full-time yeah excellent in fact uh I

mean I'll be mentioning this in in the

introduction but the reason I started

with that question was for the listener

I mean you've you've you know really

translated his one of his biggest books

imminence of truths and I think you said

you're working on his 900 page seminar

uh for today Plato which is yesly am to

read if I can find the time and energy

but so yeah that's it's quite it's quite

a fun read I have to tell you the

seminars of B are are are are

astonishing like in the case with Lan

the seminars are very much more readable

open generous and um so so this is the

the big project is to translate all of

bedu seminars um we have a contract with

Columbia University press to do that and

we've had some help along the way some

um other Scholars have translated

individual volumes uh but Susan and I

are um are uh really in charge of the

whole project and we'll be translating

uh um most of the remaining seminars

excellent yeah in fact I mean I mean

you're really the first who I consider

Badu scholar that I'm talking to on the

podcast however I've spoken to many

thinkers who been deeply influenced by

Buu's work uh let's call them Buu uh

afficianados and they all told me if you

want to get him yes read his read his

you know let's call it magnumopus but go

go and read his seminars if if it's

translated cuz that's there's something

really there kind of like laone I mean I

think now it's changing but if I'm not

mistaken people made the mistake with

like H they pick up a cre uh and they're

like what's this all about and but then

you got to start with the seminars

excellent Professor okay so as I was

mentioning before we start our recording

um just to start on a bit of a personal

note I'm interested for you personally

here yeah what Drew you towards uh Buu's

philosophy not just to the point of just

being um yeah like a like a let's say

a connoisseur but rather you know

putting in all this work to translate

his seminars and really become a ban a

scholar uh if you could just tell us a

bit about that sure my first uh

knowledge of B you at all um was through

my friend Bruce Frink who is a a

translator scholar and practicing

psychoanalyst and uh uh Bruce and I

became good friends and I asked Bruce at

one point back in

1989 I think um who is the you know the

philosopher that you studied with in

Paris who was really the most profound

and he had no hesitation in saying elmed

you and so okay I had never heard of him

and not many people had in America at

that point and so another friend uh

brought me um his great book uh being an

event home from Paris and I started

immersing myself and bed you um and then

um very fortunately um things changed be

became much more personal um besides the

kind of intellectual shock and

excitement of reading his work when in

uh

2001 uh I invited him to speak at a

conference I organized uh at UCLA on St

Paul um bedu had an important book he

wrote on St Paul also came from a

seminar and many other contemporary

thinkers had been working on St Paul a

gambin and zek and many other

interesting people so we had a big

conference and brought all of them

together and uh I was just thunderstuck

by bet you in person um I was absolutely

you know compelled by him uh he's an

extremely attractive open generous

person very very loving and you know

good-natured and it was it was really

quite an experience and then for many

years uh every year at least sometimes

more often bed you would come to Los

Angeles and we would have either a

conference um that he was involved in or

we would have just him for a series of

talks at UCLA and other local

universities uh and so we became very

good friends and uh um this led finally

to um our mutual friend Susan Spitzer

starting to translate uh his work and

then Susan and I started working on some

of the projects together first of all

the ones that were specifically on laan

which um was again where I was coming

from intellectually and then we expanded

and started doing more and more of his

work uh so it was a very profound kind

of conjunction of personal intellectual

finding somebody who you know clearly

you know welcomed Lan was responsive to

Lan saw Lan as one of his great Masters

but was for me ultimately giving me

something that Lan did not give me he

gave me much more sense of um if you

will something positive something that I

could do that would bring something good

and true into the world rather than you

know this what I take as the somewhat

pessimistic uh philosophy underlying

Lan's thinking which simply as psycho

analysis in general looks to find a

better symptom if you will a more

livable version of neurosis possibly

includes some real

transformation but um I think remains on

a very subjective level meaning a very

personal level and bed you seemed to

open something up to me that involved

changing the world not just myself

that's fascinating I mean okay if I

could go out on a limb here and just ask

um if you could hone in on that is this

because I'm curious if you could just

expand that point really uh is this

because of B's neoplatonism or what do

you mean by this notion that he gave you

something positive beyond what Lacon and

psychoanalysis gave you Professor yeah

first of all I wouldn't uh associate him

with

neoplatonism um it's a it's just because

of the history of that concept

neoplatonism um for bedu is the version

of platonism we associate it with

figures like platinus who were leading

to the christianization of Plato which

for bedu is an

Abomination so I would call him platonic

or possibly neoplatonic on some level

but I would I would avoid you know that

particular word but yes I mean he is a

he has first and foremost a platonist a

thinker of Plato someone who agrees with

Plato on most things and sees Plato as

articulating what is most important in

life as well as what philosophy can

offer Us in terms of ways of

living and Plato was um you might say uh

first of all battling against the

sophists that's a historical fact in his

work he's he's trying to um if not

refute the sophist at least silence them

to to he sees the sophist as his real

enemies and the sophists are the ones

who believe that everybody has an

opinion all opinions are potentially

equally good and relative and so there's

a kind of a you know a relativism a

skepticism a kind of a disbelief in the

Universal and absolute possibilities of

truth that Plato identifies and for bedu

that is crucial right how do we how do

we restore a notion of Truth rather than

seeing truth as what Aristotle will come

to see it as as a kind of an an adequate

representation of something in the the

world right how do we get back to

Plato's idea of Truth as something that

involves a true life if you will a true

way of living bringing something truly

new into the world and that's a

radically different account of Truth

than the one that we've lived with ever

since Aristotle if you will beautiful

beautiful yeah I mean you probably can

see here my uh lack of philosophical

knowledge cuz it's funny like I said

neop platonism but what I really meant

was I think platonism but in my head I'm

kind of like oh bu is a platonist but

he's new therefore is a neopl inist

which was I understand I understand I'm

glad you corrected me there I don't want

toate any any any false false thinking

um excellent Professor um okay I think

this is a great segue because you

mentioned the notion of universalism I'm

deeply interested in this cuz I have to

admit um before even baju I was drawn

towards what you'd call I think the

Liana school or the Slovenian school so

alanas panek Mah of course andek and one

reason I always appreciated them was

because they were for me at least from

from my reading Universalist thinkers

you know especially with Hegel and

whatnot they are universalists yeah and

then of course eventually like like most

people I mean baju is is such a big

figure in philosophy I was you know I

started reading B do uh can you tell us

yes just again a very naive question

when when either you or B speaks of

universalism what does that

entail yeah um well first of all uh it

is a kind of way of criticizing

relativism and um and uh if you will

finitism the limitations that those

things imply rather than implying that a

kind of a truth if you will that is

historical that's specific to a location

a time that could be true in one place

but not really true in another Badu's

model of Truth is really much more based

on mathematics the idea of a

mathematical truth if you will is

something that is not relative in any

way it is eternal

um the truths that uid articulated are

still true today even if they don't

explain as much of the world as we as we

now know there is if you will right

nevertheless they are they have an

absolute truth to them and his methods

of understanding how to reach a truth

are absolute they're not simply we can

say you know that was ancient Greece and

now we have different different ideas

well yes we have new new ideas we have

other ideas but that didn't make them

any less

Universal there was nothing specific to

one place or time about that kind of a

truth and so mathematical truths really

become more paradigmatic than other

types of truths if you will or knowledge

which is the the opposition that bad you

will finally make the truths have to be

distinguished from knowledge a truth

isn't something that we

simply understand as

um something we know and we know for

sure that has a kind of a certainty and

a and a you know an establish this to it

a truth is something that we produce

that we bring into the world that if you

will is the underlying truth of a world

and this gets back to the question of

the

universal because it's generic to the

world it's part of a generic something

which is not specific to any particular

part but is ubiquitous is part of the

whole is is is indiscriminately

distributed among you know across a

world right so a truth is something that

is on the one hand imminent to a world

and reveals something about the world

the contradictions that inform that

world and by revealing it it's a way to

bring something new into the world

something which is not coming from

outside but precisely from that internal

unseen but everywhere present

contradiction or

singularities or IND discernability

something that doesn't register to the

to the general encyclopedias of

knowledge the general consensus about

what counts and what really is there and

that's something that is a kind of a

univers alism that says that it's not

specific again to a time or a place

right it's there to be found and to be

brought out as something that we've

never seen before right so truth will

surprise us and it's not aimed at

anybody in particular it's aimed

universally so you can't have a truth

that is somehow only about certain

people only counts in certain limited

ways or um only some people think of as

true there has to be something truly

Universal about a truth yeah so you

mentioned this term

finitism uh would it be the case that

finitism

involves I think you you write about

this in your uh preface to imminence of

truits it involves uh like ideology so

if you say ideology is that a kind of a

finite way of thinking like an ideology

of a a culture or a nation and so

on yeah I think that's one way of

understanding of finitism um finitism

are ways of seeing

situations as closed as limited as

having a kind of an insularity to them

whether we're talking about the

finiteness of the body or the finiteness

of you know possibilities within a

collective

or any other F you know the great one of

course that haiger and others will

insist on of death right all those

finitism that you argues are really in a

ways attempt to ward off attempts to to

to

avoid the kind of dizzying experience of

the infinite the infinite is the primary

experience that we all have and actually

mathematics is quite interesting on this

notion too that infinite numbers are

much more if you will real and

interesting and significant than finite

numbers finite numbers are kind of a

small strange subclass of what's really

out there which is infinite numbers

right the great hierarchy of of the

larger Cardinals and what we have done

not only if you will in a certain level

of mathematics by thinking of it as

enumeration as counting right as

determining the number of something

right um but all these various

ideological ways is to avoid thinking

the truly infinite right the larger

infinites that would not allow such

reductions if if they were allowed to

speak for themselves if you will

beautiful beautiful yes okay Professor I

mean okay before we get to a bit of his

philosophy I have two you might call

them tangential questions on Buu the

philosopher I'm curious so with

everything you said the universalism the

notion of truths being imminent and the

contradictions you spoke

of in in terms of let me see how I can

formulate this question in terms of

let's say uh

Buu's philosophical

milia in the French Theory scene that he

came up in and how was he situated as a

tinker with within that

Mia it's a good question it's an

important uh you know issue really um he

is um not typical of any school or any

group his he came up um in the kind of

usual way that those uh major

philosophers did uh going into the aold

normal Superior you know in a class and

included many of the other great

philosophers of our time um but he was

in many ways different from them his

first Great Master as you know somebody

who was becoming increasingly involved

in in philosophy was sarf right and um

this led him to in a sense break with

SRA at a certain point or at least shift

alliances as many people did and see

there as the new kind of focal point and

a new type of you know thinking that

involves structure and Mathematics for

many of the people included

psychoanalysis for the first time right

and there was a real kind of focus for

many years on

alir but like many people uh you know

alir was disappointing for bedu um his

response to what happened in in 68 in

Paris was was not what people had hoped

for and there was a real a real kind of

uh an emergence of the idea that

something new had to come maoism was

clearly an important uh influence at

this point and bed's political

activities are another huge topic of

conversation because besides a

philosopher he has um for many years was

a very very Act active participant in

making New

Politics but intellectually what was

singular about him at that point was as

the kind of post alerian movement was

emerging and deconstruction was becoming

more and more dominant bedu was

resistant to a lot of the uh assumptions

of

deconstruction a lot of the people who

bedu was favoring beginning with Plato

um were very much out of favor um with u

most of the major philosophical thinkers

at that point B you um was defending

Plato as a source of really new exciting

inspiring

possibilities where many people like uh

dareda or roll sier were much more

critical of Plato Plato had been the

kicking boy for you know all of the 20th

century of every every school you could

imagine right people one thing people

agreed on the 20th century was that

Plato was really bad right whether it

was because he was a fascist

totalitarian whether a chrisan you know

whatever you thought whatever you

thought Plato represented the opposite

but not for bed you and so that's that

was um a real important point of

singularity in his thinking

similarly his um approach to his

relationship with psychoanalysis and

laan was was rather singular in those in

those days I'm talking about the late

60s early 7s and on um he was taking Lan

as seriously as the most hardcore

leanians were he was not himself a

practicing psychoanalyst nor was he

himself in therapy or in in analysis um

but he saw what Lan was doing as having

real significance for him for his own

thinking and for really what is

happening in the world not as philosophy

but as what he calls anti philosophy

which nevertheless all philosophers must

learn from must think their way through

and aler to further

philosophy um so look the kind of the

posit positivity that he had for for

Plato and I should also add deart to

there too deart became a kind of a

another kicking boy uh for French

philosophy the one who seemed to you

know to Center the subject in ways that

were increasingly

distasteful um with Alto zero already

and with deconstruction even more so um

and bedu insisted on the radicality of

dart's thinking he was also a hegelian

in a way that very few of his fellow um

let's say philos you know major

philosophers of the of the 70s and 80s

and in France were um Hegel was um he

was not a partisan hegelian in the way

he is if you will a partisan platonist

but Hegel he saw as a truly radical

original thinker who had to be dealt

with who he in many ways saw him self as

modeling his own career on as a

philosopher uh so his very strong

affinity for those Three Philosophers

and laon gave him a

singularity that this notion of holding

on to truth when truth was in general a

sort of a suspect category was

understood as an ideological weapon and

holding on to the subject when the

subject to was understood as a kind of a

retrograde you know kind of

essentialized category that we really

need to deconstruct and to get away from

and so Badu's originality was in holding

fast to those Concepts and pushing them

forward developing them in new and

exciting

ways let me just probably to provoke

here let me just ask you

this uh Deliz How would how would cuz

you're talking about the subject here

and

psychoanalysis uh how how did bedu and

Delian philosophy how did he view Deliz

here in this case well it's a it's a a

fraught relationship um alen was uh

somewhat younger than Duo and he uh you

know wanted to be on good terms with him

but delz um was not very interested in

what in what he was doing and ultimately

um as you may know um bedu has a book on

Deliz which is is quite critical Deliz

and finally Deliz is something like a

parallel figure for bedu he is not a

Delian um and he disagrees with him

vehemently on many points but he sees

him as a fellow traveler if you will

more uh someone he has more Affinity

with than he may have with dareda or Ard

or or the more say post structuralist

thinkers that we you know associate with

deconstruction delus the one interesting

point I might make here is that for

delus philosophy is a kind of a truth

making machine right that's what

philosophy does and for bedu it's

absolutely not the case philosophy has

no claim to produce truths whatsoever in

fact philosophy is subordinate it to the

four

areas of life that produce truths right

politics art science and love and

philosophy can't exist without those

those truth procedures and those fields

philosophy doesn't have the ability to

make its own truths it can adjudicate it

can talk about how these truths can be

compossible can be possible together if

you will how they work with each other

but it has no productivity of Truth

itself yes in fact Professor one point I

wanted to ask from you was he calls it I

believe a a disaster when philosophy

kind of becomes it it makes the mistake

of becoming a truth procedure and I

think he uses politics for instance here

where you have like a philosopher like

haiger who tries to use his philosophy

to become a Nazi or even in the case of

mar ISM uh there's this notion of where

you you entangle philosophy with the

truth procedure of politics and I'm

curious just to if you could kind of you

know RI off that really uh why

philosophy shouldn't get involved in

this notion of Truth

procedures yeah um well first of all the

problem that he sees um is one that he

calls suturing there's a tendency of all

sorts of

philosophers um let's take heiger as as

a good example um to suture philosophy

meaning making a kind of a exclusive

strong connection to one of the truth

procedures so in the case of heiger it's

art or poetry primarily right so for

heiger truth is something that poetry

makes right that poetry is kind of a a

truth procedure if you will but

philosophy is fundamentally connected to

the Poetry truth procedures in

exclusion of other possibilities and

politics and Science and again with

heiger the anti-science uh impulse is

most notorious where heiger sees science

is a kind of a

domestication you know of a taming of

knowledge giving it claims of truth that

it really can't make as a kind of an

ideology even um and tech technology in

particular is the reduction of science

to its to its Essence so there's a kind

of a positive and negative suturing of

philosophy in

heiger and for bedu the problem is you

know it's not that that poetry doesn't

produce truths it's precisely poetry

that is one of the truth prod procedures

for bedu but if we get exclusively fixed

on that one right if we suture it to

that then we lose the compossibility of

all the truth procedures and without all

of the truth procedures philosophy is if

you will lame it it's not it's not using

all of its you know its its

possibilities of you know it's not able

to talk about really why all of those

truth procedures in a particular

historical moment of time and it's

always philosophy in a moment of time

that bety was talking about why

philosophy in a particular moment of

time is possible is because it has an

awareness of the truth procedures of all

four of those fields and doesn't get

somehow you know attached in a sort of

artificial way to one over the

others interesting um is this similar to

kind of the hegelian notion of the you

know the out of manua sets forth at the

dawn of dusk the notion that philosophy

in some sense can only analyze the

current condition um and you can't

really kind of predict what's to come

and what not is it is it along those

lines or is Buu talking about something

different I think that it's a good

connection to make that uh in a sense

philosophy the ow of manur right only

works after something else has happened

and that something else is going to

happen you know not uh necessarily as it

is for heiger in terms of the history of

philosophy or the history of religion

the history of culture right history of

Nations but it's going to happen in

terms of again these these fields of

Truth procedures in relationship to what

he most famously calls an event

right some kind of a disturbance in one

of those fields that allows for the

opening of something new that allows for

that underlying generic possibility to

emerge right so yes um it's a kind of a

retrospective kind of project that

philosophy has but it's a sort of an

immediate retrospection right it's in

the present moment as it reflects back

on the way that those other Fields have

produced truths right both historically

because this is not simply a presentist

kind of notion of the production of

truth truth procedures always are in

relationship to events and events

themselves form something like a history

over time they resonate with each other

if you will truth procedures in a

particular field um so the events that

we had in the past continue and

resonating with events that happen

afterwards in politics or in art right

so we can't simply talk about the French

Revolution as an event without having

some sense of its relationship to to

Spartacus right and the slave revolts

that have that preceded it um so in that

sense um uh yeah philosophy has a kind

of a reflective quality

that could be seen as like the owl of

manura right secondary if you will to

those productive fields of

truth yes yes I mean here again speaking

of mathematics he calls George cantis

the discovery of set theory that's

that's the he calls it the Kanto event

right and then how that kind of created

something new in that regard beautiful

uh exactly yeah and that event itself is

not is not simp L its own singular event

which it it is it also resonates with

the events in mathematics that go back

to the ancient Greeks and that will

continue later on with um with you know

all the great thinkers Paul Cohen and

later thinkers who if you will

constitute their own

events yes yes okay uh I think I'd like

to just to get a better understanding of

the notion of an event here

one of my favorite books that I've read

I'd say not by B but just in my life I'd

say is his book uh impra of love just a

beautiful beautiful book and I think

that's his most popular book um and you

know influen both

non-philosophers and philosophers Al

like um and I've always like I like that

he kind of talks about the radicality of

love in that in that book and how it

doesn't fit into the Order of Things um

so I'm trying to draw the the connection

between the way he views love the love

event where it's something radically new

uh in relation or Vis A let's say what

you're describing here where in some

sense like you mentioned the French

Revolution or the discovery of SE Theory

by George caner where it still is

related to certain historical conditions

so because my understanding Professor

was that the event is something that

that in fact is it's truly new in

reality in some sense like it's it's it

can't it doesn't fit into the order of

things and I think love here again is

the best example the famous One him

using Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare

so how does can you like maybe am I am I

misunderstanding the way he speaks of an

event here or I'm I'm curious just to

hear your thoughts on that no I I I

think I think you're absolutely right I

mean there is something real singular in

every event

it it it's completely you know it's new

not to say that it comes from outside

right that's always important for bed

you this is not uh some kind of

transcendental thing that comes and

descends into our world it's there but

we never saw it if you will it's it's

it's imminent in our world and something

has to happen to make it appear and it's

not going to appear to everybody right

not everybody will agree that an event

is an event for some people it'll simply

be an aberration a disturbance or they

won't even notice what's happening right

but for someone who says no this was an

event this was truly singular it has you

know maybe again it's a love experience

you know the ex

encounter that someone says this is a

radical unthought of thing in my world I

have never experienced it that's true

and that is the the only way that love

happens according to bedu nevertheless

you know a lover is in a kind of a

history of Love at the same time where

there have been such events this is why

bet you will say everybody you know

loves lovers lovers are very attractive

because they resonate with us even if we

don't know their experience even if it's

absolutely private we have had such EXP

experiences we know about experiences

like if you will Romeo and Juliet's you

know fictitious experience or abalar and

Eloise that's one of his favorite ones

too right these exper we know that our

individual radical upheaval that is an a

love encounter is something that is

forms if you will a link in a chain with

the history of such things not to say

that those things give it its meaning

right but nevertheless every event

resonates with the previous events in

the field in which it occurs right now

an important point to make in all this

is the love event just like the science

event the politics event you know or the

the event in in in po you know in in any

field or in art that we're talking

about it really is almost a Vanishing

experience it's something that's

evanescent it comes and it goes our

relationship with events is always one

of after the fact we may experience it

and love in particular there's a kind of

an immediacy to it but then the only way

that we know that it's real if you will

that it really is an event is in terms

of what happens next right do we we

remain faithful to that love event or

that event in science and politics and

art do we develop its implications and

consequences right do we see a new world

emerge from the the the unique

perspective that love opens up of two

right that's one of the great things of

Badu's account of Love Is that love is

really what brings difference into the

world it's not a kind of fusion of two

into one it's really the production of

real Tess and I'm I'm a firm partisan of

bed Hugh's theory of love I think on a

personal existential level it's it

simply is the best theory I know

undoubted undoubtedly I completely agree

I mean I think uh you know ja really

developed his own theory of love using

by Notions is cuz if you think of like

especially I think and I'd love for you

to speak more on this cuz I can't not

have a I can't have a bad bad caller on

and not ask about love this idea where

in our contemporary culture where where

cuz we're quite

narcissistic you know people have like

he talks about like dating apps and

online dating where you you try to find

someone that you can fulfill all your

desires or like tick off all your needs

kind of like you're buying a commodity

whereas love being a disjuncture doesn't

fit into any of that it it really is

there something as you said it's a

singularity um but yeah I mean just if

you could speak more you said you know

it resonates with you

existentially uh you know in our current

amidst our culture you know kind of

capitalist Society neoliberalism what

whatever you may call it uh how how does

B view love then let's say let me

rephrase the question for someone who's

not read in place of Love who has no

idea all as very abstract metaphysics

speculative philosophy of events truth

procedures whatnot if you could just say

what is love for B uh how would you do

do that

Professor well um it's interesting uh B

you did not always see love as a truth

procedure it um it's something he

introduced into his thinking at first um

uh not to make a big history of this now

but at first politics was the most

important uh truth procedure and the

subject which we haven't really talked

about but the the concept of a subject

was primarily associated with politics

right um but as he um you know developed

and his thinking uh you know matured or

grew in various ways it became clear to

him that love had to be included as a

truth procedure and it has the very same

structure that all the truth procedures

do that we've just been talking about

where the the condition of possibility

of Love is an event there's got to be

some kind of an event just as in science

there's something if it's you know uh

caner or you know Einstein's theory

relative something that changes the very

conception of what's possible in a world

right um an event we should think of as

again something that fits in no category

categories that are recogn iable within

a particular world right something that

seems incoherent right and some basic

level maybe maybe negligible or maybe

some kind of a monstrosity but nothing

you know that is that makes any sense in

those terms and a love encounter just

like any other uh event is something

unexpected right like you say you can't

you can't go on dating apps you can't go

on uh love Island uh and see you know

and find your your perfect match right

um no it's not a question of something

that you're looking for it's something

that shocks you it surprises you and

that's the first step of love right that

there's some kind of an encounter with

another person and what really is

astonishing about that encounter is that

there's something really other in that

person that a kind of otherness it's not

simply a question of like oh we just

seem like you know uh Souls who've been

looking for each other or we're so alike

or you know or complimentary or anything

like that there's radical difference in

that other person that really surprises

you it's not like anything you expected

to see in another person all of a sudden

you're like this is not what I thought

it was this is not who I thought it was

right and then you know there's usually

the Declaration in the case of love

someone says I love you right there's

almost a formula that's a seal a kind of

a a verbal tag that's put on this

event but then the real process is quite

exciting right a love procedure love

truth procedure involves constructing a

new part of a world that is precisely

based on difference based on the fact

that you and this other person have a

kind of a you know double vision a d a

way of looking which is not in sync but

in your adjudication of those

differences you are finding things in

the world that you never realized were

there that become your own right you're

creating what bed you calls a generic

set right and that's what all truth

procedures do they articulate parts of a

world that seem not to have any

necessary connection

beforehand but from this New Perspective

the perspective of the love event now

and the Dual Vision that it gives you

you can

reassemble make new connections and

create a part of the world that you

share an expanding part

right that is that is invisible to other

people that doesn't really read Beyond

Your Love experience people Envy it if

you will they they see it and they they

love it people love love right um they

they they would like to have it or to to

find something like that but it's a

perfectly new world so there's this

process of discovery of creation of

making something new when you're with

someone you love and together you're

following a truth procedure doesn't mean

that it's a kind of a unanimity of a

kind of an easy Harmony it can involve

struggles it involve terrible conflicts

and because that's the nature of of

difference difference does not always

look so you know favorable it's not

something we always like when we see

something different right but when we

see difference yet we are experiencing

this Bond of love right it makes us say

well why is this possible how is it

possible that this other person sees the

world in a way that I never thought of

before does this change the way I see

the world too can I accommodate

this and as the two people continue to

you know to negotiate this new world

that they are creating ideally expanding

it finding more and more novelty in this

world right they're really entering into

their own reality something that's very

special and

precious yes yes yes I mean thank you

for that that was beautiful Professor I

mean I'd say like even if one isn't too

keen on philosophy just what you

described it's just at a very

existential experiential level people

people know what you're talking about

like it it doesn't even require theory

in that sense even though I defend

Theory at all times because it's it's

it's you what you put into words right

now anyone who's fallen in love knows

the notion of it being the disjuncture

the difference the the the fall the tomu

you know they they know it all beautiful

um exactly and but yet we have we have

so many let's say models of love that

are dominant right culturally that are

quite the opposite of this right yeah

and um that create much um unhappiness

yeah so yeah I I I think the book that

I've gifted the most to people in just

amongst my friends is B's Ina of love

because I I I mean I couldn't agree more

with you that the fact that what it like

what the love event does to one but also

more importantly there's there's a sense

of freedom in in the fact that you need

to freely choose you need to be

responsible in some sense to assume the

love event um and and then create a new

world with this difference um and it it

it does it does quite you know

dishearten me I'm 27 years old and I I

all of my life I've been I feel like for

my culture at least the contemporary

culture before I started reading

philosophy even as like a teenager the

kind of the love I was shown was either

there very either this transactional you

know uh kind of commodified love or the

pure

narcissistic form of love where you see

people they they want to look better

they want to I don't know look prettier

or speak better and you know there are

all these like pickup artists and all

these things we see where they make it

like a like some kind of algorithmic

game or like a

strategy uh and it it it it saddens me

that this is kind of the the way that

our cult use love I'm not again not to

be nostalgic for the past cuz in the

past they were different with like the

patriarchal Notions too uh but I I think

yeah it would really yeah perhaps to you

know speak in ethical terms do do a

service if people understood love more

in this badan sense uh it's I think

bring more happiness into the world too

people agree yeah yeah I mean romantic

love you know which is sort of the big

dominant model you know that says that

basically that you've got to be like the

other there's got to be a fusion right

and that when there's difference it's a

problem and what can that of course

there's going to be difference

difference is the nature of things

difference is

everywhere so of course that's that you

know that leads to unhappiness the other

model that um that you is very critical

of and which is closer to the more

commodity version that you're talking

about you know is really familial love

in the sense of of you know uh you know

a couple and a child right the

production of a child as a kind of a

proof of love as a sort of like the only

way that you know that love is real that

um he's very critical of not he's not a

critical of of marriage or people having

children but that this would be sort of

the definitive model of love and both of

those models have had huge histories and

um unfortunately are still infecting you

know many people and making people very

unhappy uh so yeah yeah yeah and I've

got two points on this in fact I mean

I'd love to just this is a beautiful

topic to discuss uh the first one is

it's funny I was having a discussion

with my partner just a few days ago um

and I was telling her I don't like this

notion especially men they say this they

say oh my she's she's the mother of my

children I I I I would like I don't have

children but if I do have children in

the future I i' always refer to my

partner as my partner you know I mean

and after that the mother of my children

cuz I mean firstly my partner isn't a

baby making machine but also the purpose

of our relationship isn't you know to

produce babies so I I always found that

notion a bit problematic and the second

thing okay now again to be a bit

provocative now that we're here I've

heard criticisms of B do and even

as a matter of fact that they're you

know what's the term like you know F

logocentric or you know heteronormative

because they defend monogamy and cuz I

I'm curious to hear you know there are

other forms of love I'm I'm speaking

here of Eros romantic love of course

that's familiar all of that too but just

within romantic love how would Badu you

know speak of other other forms like you

know uh what what's it called polyamory

or open relationships or whatnot and

then there's I feel like he still

defends monogamy because of the The

Singularity aspect just what are your

thoughts on that Professor yeah um well

I think that um I would say exactly

monogamy because um maybe you know

serial monogamy is something that um you

that perhaps zek um certainly and bedu

to some extent too might support but um

but I think you're right that there is a

kind of a a lurking

heteronormative um aspect in bed use

thinking and let's face it I mean

despite um protests and developments in

the thinking there is in lon's uh

thinking too um that there is a certain

Assumption of a kind of a radical

difference between men and women um that

will be the constitutive of you know

of the possibility for love for Lan the

possibility of Love is you know is still

questionable whether it's anything more

than a kind of an illusion or a sort of

a you know a narcissistic mistake we

make um but whatever counts um as love

um is going to be based on the nonsexual

encounter between a man and a woman

right now what a man and a woman mean

for Lan is of course not biological

they're not talking about biological

they talk about subjective structures

right and I think that um Badu's account

like

laan's um even if bet you would not say

there's no such thing as a sexual

relationship he's like that's ridiculous

you know certainly there are sexual

relationships but if he but if he thinks

that there's a kind of a a heter

a kind of a real different radical

difference that is constituative of the

love relationship right that it does

tend to often assume the form of a a man

and woman in his in his thinking in his

examples let's put it that way um so my

sense is that there you know there's a

kind of a you know almost a kind of a um

a cultural heteronormal

ity that you know of his a man of his of

his generation you know assumes takes on

that he's not he's not woke in that in

that sense for whatever we we make of

that expression um but I don't think

it's a radical principle by any means

and he's by no means resistant to all

sorts of different configurations of of

love in practice I think that the theory

tends to be male and female

because that's the clearest account of

real difference for him but of course he

thinks that two men or two women or you

know trans people they can also have an

experience of love which is based on a

radical encounter with difference and

all the possibilities that love that

emerge so I wouldn't I wouldn't take

that critique too far I think it's more

sort of like well you know of his gen

for his generation you know that's not

surprising but it's not a kind of a it's

not a conceptual or even a you know an

ideological sort of perspective it's

more it's where his his examples come

from right and they're not meant to be

and I mean also like metaphysically the

notion is the the the the disjunction

and difference yes at least from what

I've experienced monogamy is where I've

seen that disjuncture between a man and

woman or even two men but you know two

men are different two women it doesn't

really matter two subjects let's say

however theoretically you could still

have it in a relationship Beyond two

people I assume uh that yeah but I guess

I think so yeah one thing I appreciate

again about B and even J for that matter

is that they're not moralists there's no

there's no moralism here not none of

that so uh we we could uh kind of speak

of that excellent beautiful okay uh

thank you so so much for humoring me

with that that was great U oh no I I

love talking about bed you on love I

agree with you it's it's one of the most

um you know kind of satisfying and

communicable aspects of his thinking I

completely agree yeah it's it's again to

kind of reiterate my previous Point even

for someone who has no interest in

philosophy or ontology or metaphysics

this topic I think resonates as

something and let's face it you know the

the bar is pretty high for a lot of you

know entry into bedu thinking for a lot

of his work yeah it's high there's no

question but love is a wonderful

exception to that I agree I mean I

bought what being an event uh what four

four years ago now I'm still reading it

you know it's just one of those books

it's a very difficult

book It's a Wonderful book and it's

worth close reading it's helpful to read

it in a group I really think reading

with other people is very very helpful

um but but it's it's it's hard there's

no question and for many people

mathematics is a real problem um you

know Badu's account of mathematics is

that it's really the most clear

transparent possible language right it's

the opposite

of difficult you know that it has

everything pure and straightforward

about it but nevertheless for many

people it's not the case at all and we

experience math is you know is maybe a

little traumatic even right uh so this

is unfortunate and and I I do hope to

help people experience the math also

intuitively as something that you don't

simply have an abstract conception of

but you can make new sense out of if you

think about it you know and have good

teachers which I've been fortunate to

have no doubt no doubt I mean it's funny

you say that cuz I listened to a lecture

by BYU uh I think it was called

philosophy and Mathematics or something

and he makes this bit of a tongue and

Shake comment that you know mathematics

it's problematic not because it's too

difficult but because it's too it's too

simple and what he meant by that was

this notion that yeah it's very

straightforward in in the if you can get

it you get it like there's no ambiguity

in in the mathematical symbolism or the

signifiers so there's something there

uh all right I I do feel I feel like we

did touch on this in our conversation at

certain points but I kind of do want to

just have like a a segment of the

episode just on the notion of beue and

truth so you start in the uh

introduction introduction to uh begin

volume 3 Eminence of truits you said the

heart of alamar's philosophical work

since the

1980s has been the project of

reconceiving and reclaiming a concept of

of Truth so what yes Professor what does

that mean what what what is this project

that Alan bud is involved in and Budin I

assume yeah yeah um again uh truth is is

one of those um you know words that um

goes in and out of fashion right um we

um tended to be skeptical of Truth um in

the '90s and the beginning of the the

21st century we tended to see it as

ideology as somebody's truth a

particular truth that's masquerading as

the universal right and then in uh very

harrowing and depressing uh Trump era

truth has once again become uh a very

important value when

misinformation and you know just

delusion seem to be uh spreading so

easily

people have really once again sort of

said well we do need truth we need some

sense of what truth is um but you know

the problem is that um we don't really

have a good account of truth truth is is

a a concept that um tends to easily

dissolve

into um all the various um let's say um

fields that in which you become

objectionable um it becomes easily

ideology it becomes somebody's truth it

becomes an opinion that has become a

popularized opinion and then gains

currency right truth is easily

manipulated and distorted when we

understand it as correspondence right

and this again goes back to Aristotle

Aristotle really um if not invented he

codified the idea

that truth means the

correspondence um between a

representation and something in the

world or an idea right so you have a

kind of notion of adequacy is this

notion this concept this word you know

this

representation adequate does it get at

right does it represent the thing out

there

well enough does it does it get at its

particularity we might

say and that became our Benchmark of

Truth and for Aristotle it's very much a

critique of Plato to present truth in

those terms right um and that's a long

discussion we don't really need to get

into that now but the notion of Truth as

a kind of an accurate reliable

representation of reality you know

became

dominant and one should not dismiss this

by any means the question is how do we

understand it do we understand what B

you will call not truth but

veridicality right if there's a kind of

a an accuracy of representation which we

certainly do need to Value we should not

by any means minimize and we know more

and more in in in our contemporary world

that it's a precious commodity the

knowledge and really this is where

knowledge and Truth become opposed the

knowledge of how representations of

things connect or don't connect to

things in the world right that's a very

a very important part of our human

existence and knowledge in those in that

sense is how we construct what bedu

calls uh in being an event the

encyclopedia that we live in every

situation whether we're talking about

you know uh a political

situation an artistic world a scientific

World whatever situation we're talking

about it has the terms that that you

calls an

encyclopedia that Define its parameters

that establish what counts as an

acceptable representation of knowledge

and what is excluded right what is

recognizable as knowledge and Truth in

in The Limited sense of Truth um and

what is repudiated is not significant

right so a world gets um established

where there's certain ways of seeing

things this counts you know in a certain

it's a very structuralist account we

might say very semiotic where you know

when you are in most of the world not

all the world most of the world and you

see a red light when you're driving it

means stop right when you see a green

light it means go right that's an

established kind of a a parameter that

defines the universe of the rules of the

road right so to be to work in that

world well you have to obey that basic

established set of conventions when

you're in a classroom there are similar

conventions right we know there are

social conventions that say you don't

you know run screaming to the front of

the room and tear up the professor's

book right that's not considered

legitimate and there are other you know

things that are recognizable considered

legitimate activities right there's a

discourse you might say in more leanian

terms the discourse of the university in

that case that establishes the

parameters of knowledge and of facts and

this is again not to be dismissed by any

means are minimized in terms of its of

its value but what it pro prohibits the

problem with it is that it doesn't allow

us to see something really new right

like if you've read that that um that

wonderful um book flat land kind of a a

mathematical fantasy about what it means

if you're in a two-dimensional world

right a world which is just a plane and

a three-dimensional creature enters into

that world

right well you can't see it as a

three-dimensional creature you would see

it if it was a sphere you would see it

as a as a point that would slowly become

a circle that would expand and then

contract again to a point as it passed

through that that the plane that we live

on right so it's fundamentally not

available to you to know what a sphere

is in that world even if a sphere is a

real thing right it's not available to

that two-dimensional world now the same

thing happens with every sphere of

knowledge where we have an established

in cyclopedia we have all the facts and

we have we're able to judge new things

that come in in terms of the

pre-existing knowledge and encyclopedia

the kind of like tables of what count

and what are excluded right all that um

is available to us but if something

really new comes comes about we don't

have the vocabulary for it we don't have

the knowledge for it and this is

precisely the possibility not yet a

truth but the possibility of a truth for

bedu right if he calls it an event right

the event will have a site a Locus a

specific point in which it emerges in a

particular situation or

world when I use those words in uh

interchangeably a world is merely um

Badu's later sense of a situation that

includes not only

ontology right but phenomenology how

things appear in in a world as well as

how they are uh constituted

ontologically um so in a situation or in

a world when something truly new emerges

it's not parsible in terms of the

encyclopedia this is the possibility of

a truth and it's only a possibility

right it takes something and this is

when the subject really emerges in bedu

because truth and the subject are

intimately

connected any individual an individual

is if you will a prub or a not yet

subject for B you any

individual has the possibility of

looking at that thing and saying whoa

something just happened what the hell

was that and if they decide that it in

fact was something that matters that

matters to them existentially right not

just in some abstract way and that makes

them want to go ahead and find what else

might be connected with that happening

right whether it's again a political

event or some innovation in science

something completely new

emerges in that world and then in that

world of knowledge we have a gap right

and this is where bedu says that truth

establishes a ho in knowledge right Wan

will say the same thing heiger will say

the same thing even you know Plato and

to some extent Hegel will say something

similar right that truth emerges

precisely where knowledge fails where

something and knowledge no longer is

adequate to this new you know something

this upsurging something imminent to

that world but never before available

never before

seen so at that moment that decomp

completion of that that that world that

encyclopedia allows the possibility for

a subject to emerge because the subject

what bedu calls a subject is simply L

the

local

instantiation of the process of tracing

the implications of that event and

establishing that what we talked about

earlier as a generic set of all the

other things that it randomly Encounters

in its world that seem to be connected

with that event that seem to corroborate

in some way that seem you know maybe not

not in any obvious way but in

interesting new ways to be continuities

with that event and so you get this

growing new part this new part of of the

situation where that hole in the

knowledge of the situation first emerged

that we as subjects we who declare

ourselves faithful to that event who say

that event mattered and it mattered to

me and I'm going to really spend some

time figuring out why what what you know

what's what went what happened and what

are its implications right that allows

for the production of a truth and that

truth is going to be something that was

not seen before in that world was not

available to the knowledge in the world

it's not new things that are coming into

the world but it's a new part of a world

it's new new connections among the

actual things in the world and Badu will

talk about the the things in the world

uh as bodies and languages right the

things in the world the elements in the

world there can be broken down into

those two you know types there are the

the elements the physical bodies and

then there are the languages the way in

which those bodies are codified

distributed you know given meaning right

so when in fact a truth emerges and is

starting to be built it comes in

addition to the totality of the

pre-existing world the totality of

bodies and languages in that world it's

a kind of an internal supplement a new

part of the world that's using those

same elements but arranging them in

unheard of ways ways imminence right

that's the imminent pit

that's imminent and that's that's what

forb you is the proletariat right the

proletariat is not a particular class of

workers or people who are

disenfranchised who own nothing but the

proletariat is that imminent group that

emerges precisely in that way in in

politics if you will yeah that that was

a really good connection there I love

that you that connection yeah cuz I feel

like this kind of the disenfranchise out

of migrants ref Futures whatever that's

a more of a liberal way of viewing the

the so-called working class or or what

whatnot uh that was great thank you

thank you profor okay um just a a slight

segue here or perhaps a tangential

question uh would would be you mention

the term event I've read in multiple

places or even heard people talk about

the fact that

foru uh 911 was not an event so just yes

a concrete example

to further perhaps elucidate this why

wasn't 911 an event for

Buu yeah it's it's a good question and

and you can expand that to why you know

you know provocatively he'll you know

he'll ask why the Holocaust was not an

event you know what is an event an event

in that sense is something that we

really do need to specify right because

it's not just something unheard of

that's happening something that occurs

for which there is no precedent that's

not recognizable it's precisely there

are certain parameters that it has to

have in terms of the kind of you know

what what emerges out of it right and

those first of all involve

universality right you can't have an

event that is only an event for some

people or is an event that you know by

definition excludes some people right an

event is

got to be completely open to everyone

there's an egalitarianism at the heart

of Badu's thinking which is utterly

crucial so if we think of you know

something like 911 it was you know it

was in event in a kind of an intuitive

sense of the word it disrupted the world

it was you know it was in in some ways

an upsurge of something that was

unrecognizable ible here to for right

but the question finally is and it's

only in retrospect that you can judge

whether an event was an event or not is

did it lead to Universalist

possibilities did it did did what

emerged from it construct new truths and

a truth is you know again egalitarian

Universal infinite and absolute

and you could simply you know you can

simply say that there's what he'll call

a pseudo event when we're talking about

911 we when we're talking about the

Holocaust when we're talking about

disasters that's another way of talking

about disasters of various sorts are

terrible and can have incredible

implications sometimes even positive

ones can come out of them right but

unless they're truly Universal let's say

there's an event let's let's not go to

such extreme examples but something more

local right if there is an event that

somehow changes the conditions of

existence of a particular group of

people that something happens and you

know the whether we're talking about a

class of people or race or ethnicity

whatever that it that it allows them to

really just kind of improve their

quality of life if you will to change

things in a way that would be clearly

beneficial obviously positive it doesn't

count as an event for bedu if it doesn't

have truly Universal implications

meaning if it can't be extended beyond

that identity group all right there's a

real resistance to Identity politics in

in bed Us's thinking he really doesn't

understand struggle as a struggle for

individual group rights he sees the

struggle as always a collective struggle

always for Universal rights or Universal

freedoms right for equality equality is

the

overwhelming right sort of if you will

ethical principle in bad use thinking

much more so than Liberty right would be

would be I think he's very suspicious of

you know the way that freedom Liberty

get used but equality is a kind of a

radical bottom line for him and if

something prefers one group of people in

any way there's a problem you know yes

yes I should just mention a bit of a

point here um another thinker who's

deeply influenced me uh contemporary

thinker Todd McGavin he uh wrote a book

called uh emancipation after Hegel but

also he's mentioned this in a couple of

his talks this idea is that if you're a

true leftist you have to be a

Universalist you can't the the the

particularism or being a particularist

is inherently a right-wing ideology

because it's about uh you know so ID

politics for him would be without a

doubt a rightwing it's sort of a rtist

way of viewing things because again it's

particular groups be race gender whatnot

so and it's it's again this is the the

point we you know discussing at the

outset this universalism that I'm deeply

attracted to in Badu in the San school

and even Hegel uh and I think really I

would even argue now I'm curious to hear

your thoughts on more of a contemporary

political discussion Professor like with

the re-election of trump and how really

the so-called populist movement has been

taken over by uh ring is and

reactionaries I really think the left

needs to just jettison any kind of

particular risk politics or

identitarianism because I really don't

see it going anywhere in my humble

opinion I I completely agree with you

and I completely agree with Todd by the

way who's a good friend of mine um so

yeah um you know this is this is an

important point but I do think there's

something we have to kind of a something

that complicates us a little bit there

is the possibility and slav O will talk

about this a lot of people talk about

this of

sublating a particularity to a universe

right that the particular Universal is

not a kind of a radical opposition corre

right something concrete for Hegel right

is precisely some particular element

that has been given Universal value so

this means that a particular struggle an

individual struggle doesn't need to

remain an

identitarian you know kind of uh you

know localized specific uh sort of

problem it can Elevate itself to a

universal struggle a universal cause and

I think that that's really important

that the universal doesn't come from the

top down I mean for Hegel in particular

uh and I think that bedu uh and the

slovenians will agree with this that it

really involves the making concrete of

something particular something

particular can gain Universal value and

and so an event is always something

particular right it happens in a in a

situation it's it's historically

specific in every way right and then the

project of of you know tracing its

implications of creating that new

generic set is at the process of

universalizing it right of sublating it

to the universal in in hegelian terms

indeed um

so so you know I agree though that our

immediate problem is identitarianism

though that that becomes a kind of a you

know a sort of a you know unfortunately

it's been I think um the death of the

you know of the left of the Progressive

Movement however you want to put it

right that we need to get away from from

that uh and

find you know find a way to sublate

these uh particularities to a more

common Universal struggle yeah I

otherwise we lost I would just say as an

Australian just um you know uh leaving

aide theory for a moment it's just it's

even existentially it's exhausting it's

boring it's it's vapid you know identity

politics and you feel like you kind of

get stuck and um so yeah the left any

anyway it's a whole other whole other

can of willm to open up there uh all

right Professor just just the this is a

last hopefully fun question I'm just

curious uh you know you I feel like

you're the best been fun yeah oh great

oh that's that's that's the best that's

the best thing I could hear from you

thank you thank you uh uh I would I

would say so I mean I think you're the

best person to ask this question given

you've written a book with je the

neighbor you you wrote that book um and

then you've done all Eric s too yes

sorry I should mentioned that too um uh

I I'll leave a link uh I'll put an

overlay uh to the book while while we

discussing it U for for the uh not the

listeners in this case the viewers um

and then you've done all this work on

Badu so yeah one last fun question uh

what in your view are the big

differences between Badu and J

well that's a can of worms uh but

actually in in the seminar that um my

translation partner Susan and I are

working on now on Plato it's quite

interesting it's a as you said it's like

a 900 page seminar it's it extends over

three years and um twice um slavo comes

in and is a guest speaker in the seminar

and one of the sessions they have the

whole session is really devoted to what

are the similarities and the differences

between our

thinking and uh so it's a quite involved

uh discussion but one thing that I think

is very you know quick and clear um to

distinguish them and I think that

they're really on the same page in many

many ways um but one thing that does

distinguish them is um this leanian and

Freudian ocean of the death Drive Right

death is is really

um something quite different um for the

two of them um you know as a good

leanian um

slavo you know gives a Primacy to to the

notion of the death drive and repetition

of course it's you know what keeps us

you know from um you know from happiness

it's what it's what forces us to repeat

our symptoms to you know cling to our

pain and all that and you know with he

has very good reason to to make those

arguments as psychoanalysis does that

just look around at the kind of terrible

pain that we see the

self-destructiveness

self-generated you know repetitive you

know kind of pain and how can we

understand this otherwise for

bedu um it's not the case at all There

Is No Death Drive I mean maybe you know

on a certain psychological level

he would agree that there is a kind of a

radicality of the Pleasure Principle

which means you know in almost technical

Freudian terms the the tendency to

evacuate all tension you know to Return

To Zero but in real terms betu doesn't

really believe in death death does not

mean to to Alan uh what it means to the

psychoanalytic world or for that matter

heiger right something which is a

fundamental condition of Life a

limitation right which is imminent

within us which is always conditioning

our experiences whether that means our

repetitive

experiences our you know our failures to

achieve happiness and all the various

things that we suffer from for

bedu death is simply something that

happens it's something that happens from

the outside it's not uh intrinsic to the

human subject it's intrinsic of course

to the human being the human individual

dieses it's there's no question about

that but in much more profoundly

important terms B you wants to insist

that we do have the possibility all of

us of being Immortal that there's a real

there's a real

immortality in a truth procedure in

becoming the subject of a truth

procedure enjoying the collective work

of a truth procedure we are really

gaining an immediate universality and

Eternity right there's something you

know that resists death absolutely that

doesn't know death and bed used notion

of a truth procedure truth procedures

may have their periodizations they may

come and go but they're Eternal they can

always come back again they can always

resurf and be developed and expanded in

new ways so death death is not you know

by any means a limitation for bedu or a

condition that determines our experience

of life and that I think is the biggest

difference between him and

slavo perfect yes I mean I I think

you're right the slavo and the civilian

school they do very much for them the

death Thrive is it's ontological really

it's it's like this almost Drive even

independent some sense to the subject

that just keeps going it's like a brute

on fact of the universe in some sense uh

yeah right that but that was really

important I'm glad that you fleshed that

out especially I did have a question on

psychoanalysis and I think you really

you know really connected it beautifully

to all the other discussions we've been

having um so far uh yeah this was great

Professor this has been very solidifying

if I may say uh yeah I mean we did touch

on this at the outset yes but if you

could just for the listeners uh apart

from yes the 900 page seminar what other

projects are you working on uh at the

moment and what what can we expect

what's in the pipeline let's

say uh well the next seminar that will

come out um that Susan and I translated

which I'm very excited about is on

Parmenides the um early Greek thinker

who um beu has an amazing reading of

truly you know powerful

revisionary quite extraordinary um so I

think that's something to look forward

to it'll come out this spring um there's

another book that um will also come out

this spring which is just a wonderful

totally readable book something along

the lines in some ways of the the book

in Praise of love he has a book coming

out in Praise of philosophy and that is

um a dialogue it's a Socratic dialogue

there's a a kind of a Socrates SL bedu

figure and a whole group of young people

from all over the world uh including

amantha his um his addition to his when

he translated um Plato's Republic he

introduced this this woman character

amantha instead of a diamantes which is

quite interesting and this is just a

lovely lovely readable book it's a play

as much as anything else it really could

be staged so I think that that's a

terrific uh first book for people to

read of bad use and for people who are

perhaps interested in Greek philosophy

in mathematics and really the

relationship of philosophy and

Mathematics the seminar on Parmenides is

astonishing after that I'm I'm very much

looking forward to uh the publication

the book is now complete um uh Bruno BS

a great beduan scholar uh has translated

bedu seminar at n and that is absolutely

amazing that will be coming out um after

the parmen

seminar and uh I I guess I could say

that after Plato which is going to take

us a while still it's so

enormous we are we are looking forward

to finally getting to um bedu heiger

seminar that is a personal favorite too

wow well I I can say one thing for sure

yourself and Susan you both sure do have

your hands

full L uh maybe I mean I don't know we

can talk about this offline because I I

did this did catch my eye on in the

email you sent me when it's out in press

of philosophy I'd love to invite you and

Susan again just discuss the book uh in

in the future if that's okay sure yeah I

think it's you know it's a wonderful

book

yeah and

uh yeah uh yeah uh let's let's see if

Susan would join us I'm not sure she

would but she yeah I mean I'll extend

the invite if she to it yeah great thank

you
