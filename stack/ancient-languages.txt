Mecha@gpt-4 5> Can you try to write in Phoenician?

The Phoenician language uses a unique alphabet system that is not supported by most modern devices and systems. It's also important to note that the Phoenician language has been extinct for over 2,000 years, and as such, there are very few people who can read or write it. However, here is an example of what the Phoenician alphabet looks like:

𐤀 (’āleph), 𐤁 (bēt), 𐤂 (gīml), 𐤃 (dāleth), 𐤄 (hē), 𐤅 (wāw), 𐤆 (zayin), 𐤇 (ḥēth), 𐤈 (ṭēth), 𐤉 (yōdh), 𐤊 (kāp), 𐤋 (lāmedh), 𐤌 (mēm), 𐤍 (nūn), 𐤎 (sāmekh), 𐤏 (ʿayin), 𐤐 (pē), 𐤑 (ṣādē), 𐤒 (qōp), 𐤓 (rēš), 𐤔 (šin), 𐤕 (tāw).

These are the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet, which were used to write the Phoenician language. Each symbol represents a different sound, much like letters in the English alphabet. However, the actual words and sentences of the Phoenician language could be quite complex and are beyond the scope of this response.

Mecha@gpt-4 7> I was just seeing if Phoenician characters showed up in my terminal.

I see! If you're testing how your terminal handles different characters, it's important to remember that support can vary depending on the software you're using. Phoenician characters are part of the Unicode standard, but not all systems or fonts may support them. If you're seeing unrecognized characters or boxes, it might mean your terminal or the font it's using doesn't support these characters.
