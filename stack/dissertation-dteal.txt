Microfabrication, the set of manufacturing techniques used to make computer chips, displays,
MEMS, and other devices, is famously difficult, slow, and capital equipment heavy. In this
dissertation we propose a much simpler path toward rapid prototyping of microfabricated
devices by deposition of nanoparticles in vacuum.
We will discuss generation of nanoparticles of standard microfabrication materials such as
metals, oxides, and semiconductors, as well as methods to manipulate these as aerosols in
low-pressure gas, culminating in a demonstration of multimaterial printing. We will then
describe electrical charging of nanoparticles and develop a new method to electrostatically
focus and accelerate nanoparticles theoretically capable of printing with sub-1 µm resolution.
Finally, we will detail the future work required to 3D print silicon transistors and conclude our
new manufacturing process will likely be faster and cheaper than standard microfabrication
for making small quantities of simple chips.

Acknowledgments
With the understanding that the acknowledgments section of a thesis is traditionally freed
from the rigid constraints of academic formality:
I need to give huge thanks to Kris. You let me pursue this initially-uncertain project despite
your wish I spent more time building cooler MEMS robots with traditional microfabrication;
I still intend to build plenty of better robots via printing someday. You were simultaneously
an excellent advisor, providing proof it’s possible to be good at many things, kind to people,
and kinda funny sometimes. You set a good example. I also need to give a shoutout to
the rest of my thesis committee—Clark, Jeff, and Hartmut—for going along with it and
letting me try something a bit unusual. I’m pretty happy with the result.
Thanks to everyone I met and lived with here at Berkeley. Lydia, it’s nice to know somebody
who knows what they want in life and is excellent at finding it. Durham, for successfully
convincing me that more is possible then pushing me to discover it. Kevin and Lars, for
being omnipresent around BSAC, willing to banter, and each good at your own thing. To all
my group members, past and present, I appreciated working with you: Hani and Craig, for
mentoring me in MEMS; Mauricio and Alex and Nathan, Alexander and Dillon, and
now Yichen and Daniel (Lovell) and Yu-Chi and Titan and then Amanda. The same to
Anju, Micah, and other Swarm Lab members. Thanks also to the BSAC staff, especially
Dalene: you were always on top of things, available, helpful, and forgave me when I turned
stuff in late. Then there’s everyone I worked with to teach EE143 over the years. To all the
TAs: Niharika, Lars (again), Jason, Yejin, Judd, Hanuman, Adi, Jongho, and Reaz:
I appreciated working together; y’all are great. EE143 professors Ali and Jeff (again!), I had
a good time. Plenty of my microfabrication knowledge comes from the Marvell NanoLab and
its staff: Bill, Ryan, Allison, Joanna, Sam, Danny, Anthony, Greg, Tariq, Daniel
(Martinez), Dave, and everyone else. Thanks for for showing me what a proper well-run
fab looks like. I always enjoyed how organized and competent yet relaxed (like, decent work
hours) y’all were; I will hold other organizations up to your standard (and if I complain
about microfabrication, that’s only the fault of physics; I get the impression Marvell’s about
the best a research fab can be). Thanks also to all my other Berkeley professors; I enjoy
being able to find researchers working on just about anything.
Thank you to my family: Mom and Dad, for always being there: kind and simple back-
ground support is the best kind, and I cannot imagine anything better. To Erin and Kristen
and Robert and Mary (and now Jacob and Eleanor), you’re all the best. And to everyone
else (of course including Uncle John and Grandpa Teal’s questions).

Thanks to everyone else from earlier times, friends and colleagues. To members and mentors
from the UT Austin makerspace, the UT IEEE RAS club, and LASA Robotics: I still take
the same approaches I learned with you to both engineering and life.
To researchers who worked on this and other problems in the past: thanks for your work (and
then for publishing it!). Y’all did good, and I hope my work similarly inspires others. Being
able to simply look up progress on most problems makes it possible to go so much further.
I tried to reference prior work everywhere I could; apologies to anyone I missed.
Thanks to the diffuse group of authors and musicians and artists and engineers whose works
of fiction and otherwise have kept me sane these past years then shown me what could be.
If anything makes life worth living, it’s what we choose to make from it.
And to everyone else: you make this world a better place. I rather enjoy it. (And if I omitted
anyone, I’m sorry, that was unintentional. You’re worthwhile.)
Financially, credit goes to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) (grant
DGE 1752814), which gave me the freedom to explore ideas eventually resulting in this
dissertation, and to Kris, BSAC, and Berkeley for supporting me the rest of the way.
Minimal thanks to air. Oxygen especially. I love breathing, but I gotta admit this project
would have been much easier if everything were in vacuum to begin with.
Finally: thanks to you, reader. I can’t resist breaking the fourth wall in order to wish you
luck with whatever you’re trying to do. I hope you enjoy this show.

Introduction
Contemporary life is built on computer chips and displays, LEDs and solar cells, inkjet print-
ers and cell phone RF filters. All these are made with the same set of fabrication tools, which
we collectively call microfabrication. Microfabrication is notable for three reasons:
• it lets us build nanometer-scale multimaterial devices;
• it is often the only way to build these devices;
• it is very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
This last point is unfortunate. As we will show, it means R&D is slow and microfabrication is
out of reach of most researchers and engineers. It is a testament to its importance that we’ve
persisted with microfabrication long enough to build computers and the Internet—but how
much more could be done if it were easier and accessible? We argue it is worthwhile to inves-
tigate new manufacturing methods that achieve similar results with fewer constraints.
In this dissertation, we’ll describe our progress developing one such fabrication process1. It
will not replace microfabrication in general but should be capable of creating some of the
same devices while being easier, cheaper, and faster in limited circumstances.
What are these nanometer-scale multimaterial devices, and what is the challenge in making
them? The prototypical device is a transistor, billions of which are contained in each com-
puter CPU, but other exemplar devices include solar cells and LEDs. All these are nothing
more than solid blocks of the right materials put together in the right configurations. Some
silicon here, some aluminum there, some oxides between them. This is comparable to games
like Minecraft: put particular materials in correct positions, and you have a transistor. The
difficulty is that, in reality, this needs extreme precision and control.
For example, a simple MOSFET transistor might consist of at least four different materials:
silicon with a small amount of boron, silicon with a small amount of phosphorus, silicon

dioxide (SiO2, i.e., glass), and aluminum, placed together as in figure 1.1 [1][2]. In order for
the transistor to work, the thin later of SiO2 in the center (the “gate oxide”) must be less than
100 nm thick (only several hundred atoms!), while the proportion of boron and phosphorus
(“dopants”) in silicon needs to be extremely precise with no contaminants2. Increasingly
complex improvements (silicon crystal orientation, different gate oxide materials, etc.) raise
performance. Other devices, like solar cells and LEDs, or MEMS3 devices like inkjet printer
nozzles and cellphone RF filters (which all have air gaps that allow miniature mechanical
parts to move), have their own constraints. A solar cell, for example, is just a layer of this
phosphorus-doped silicon on boron-doped silicon with metal electrodes on each side.
Figure 1.1: From left to right: a minimal transistor, tens of transistors in a cutaway view
of a chip that contains millions, the chip in a standard integrated circuit package, and the
result mounted to a printed circuit board. Right pictures from [3], [4].
Fortunately some of these constraints can often be relaxed slightly at the cost of reduced
performance, but in general interesting devices always have the following requirements:
• Multimaterial construction: These devices consist of several different types of ma-
terial, and each material must be very pure, sometimes to better than one non-silicon
atom per billion silicon. Furthermore, the interfaces between two different materials
needs to be near atomically perfect. The usual macroscopic approach of making two
parts separately then attaching them leaves rough surfaces and dust and grease and
is not good enough. Usual materials include metals (as electrical conductors), oxides
(like SiO2, often electrical insulators), and especially semiconductors (like silicon).
• High resolution: At least some parts of the more interesting devices need to be below
1 µm thick (human hair is 80 µm in diameter). Compare this to traditional macroscopic
metal machining, where just the roughness of a smooth surface might be around 1 µm!
The combination of these two qualities—multimaterial capability and high resolution—is
the main challenge that microfabrication solves and no other manufacturing method has yet
reached. Achieving this will be our main challenge in this dissertation.
2Silicon has a density of about 5 × 1022 atoms per cubic centimeter. Common levels of purposely added
dopants range anywhere from 1 × 1013 to 1 × 1020 atoms per cubic centimeter, and unwanted impurities
must be below that (less than one unwanted atom per billion others). Electrical purity silicon is one of the
most precise materials humans have ever produced and is far beyond, e.g., natural gemstones.
3Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are tiny gears, vibrating beams, and other mechanical parts
made with microfabrication. Moving parts are made by etching away specific materials to leave air gaps and
can then be moved around with electrostatics by applying a voltage via an attached electrical circuit.

1.1
Microfabrication is Hard
We now know what microfabrication has to do: it places metals, semiconductors, and oxides
together with high resolution. But how does it work, and why is it so slow and difficult?
Microfabrication is a set of different tools combined in what was originally called the planar
process, first conceptualized some 65 years ago [5][6]. Starting with a flat substrate—typically
a silicon wafer—the substrate is passed through many steps, each performed by a different
tool. Some steps deposit a thin layer of a new material across the entire surface, some add a
layer of special material onto which a 2D pattern is drawn with light (“photolithography”),
and some steps selectively etch some materials but not others. This process makes hundreds
of copies in parallel on the same wafer, so a final step cuts this into individual rectangular
chips, which are then packaged and attached to PCBs in larger devices [1][7][8].
Figure 1.2: The steps of microfabrication. A silicon wafer has material deposited, a mask
patterned, the material etched through the mask, and mask removed.
These steps are
repeated up to tens of times for multiple layers until the wafer is finally diced into complete
chips. Each step requires its own precise piece of manufacturing equipment.
This planar microfabrication process can make multimaterial devices by depositing each
material in a separate step. These thin-film deposition tools generally work by introducing
into a vacuum chamber the wafer and a cloud of atoms, which condense into a solid film
on the wafer surface, not unlike the everyday experience of water vapor condensing into fog
on a cold mirror except the condensation might be metal. There are many variations4, all
of which can precisely control film thickness to the nanometer level, sometimes even with
atomic precision (via ALD), and all result in pure materials due to the lack of contaminants
in a vacuum. Thus our first requirement, multimaterial construction, is achieved.
In order to achieve the second requirement, high resolution, in addition to precisely con-
trolling film thickness we also need to make 2D patterns across the wafer. This is achieved
by photolithography, a process in which a layer of light-sensitive polymer photoresist is de-
posited on the wafer and a pattern of light, made with a patterned mask, is magnified and
chemically changes this photoresist in exposed areas. The exposed photoresist can be etched
away, and another etching process used to selectively remove material below those areas, af-
ter which the photoresist is removed. The resolution of this process is limited mainly by the
4Some variations include evaporation and sputtering, which are often described as physical vapor depo-
sition processes, and chemical vapor deposition, in which the vapor reacts on the surface [1].

wavelength of light used and is easily sub-1 µm; 200 nm resolution is decades old technology
while state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography tools approach 10 nm.
The result is impressively capable. Microfabrication makes not only small multimaterial
transistors, but also arrays of many transistors spread across a chip—an integrated circuit
(IC)—and easily mass produces them. Early ICs quickly superseded vacuum tubes in size and
performance. As microfabrication (and especially photolithography resolution) improved,
ICs contained more transistors, quickly increasing from several thousand in the early Intel
4004 microcontroller, to millions in the 1990s, to billions of transistors per chip today (or
even trillions in terabyte memories). This rapid increase in capability, known as Moore’s
Law [6][9], allowed the rapid adoption of computers in every part of society5. Almost as an
afterthought, the same microfabrication process is used to build solar cells, LCD displays,
hard drives, DVDs, accelerometers, LEDs, microfluidic chips, and more.
That’s how microfabrication works. Why do we emphasize its difficulty?
Briefly: it is too complex. A modern CPU might have 80 layers, each of which needs its
own deposition, lithography, and etch steps, not to mention cleaning and metrology steps
in between. This means a total of hundreds or thousands of individual steps, each of which
is performed in a different piece of machinery. A wafer is moved back and forth between
these pieces of equipment6 in a process that takes days at minimum, but more often weeks to
months, and the warehouse-sized factory (“fab”) holding this equipment must be a cleanroom
to minimize dust. Even worse: if a single step messes up, there is often no way to correct
it but to start over from the beginning. Thus each tool needs to be precisely built to be
as perfect as possible, which is naturally expensive. Simpler devices like MEMS often have
fewer layers but the microfabrication process has to be customized to each device, making
them almost equally challenging to build.
To convince the reader this is worth improving, we submit the following evidence:
• 2020 chip shortage, due to time constraints: around 2020–2023, a combination
of economic factors resulted in a significant mismatch between which chips were pro-
duced by microfabrication fabs and what customers required [11]. This affected many
industries in which larger systems (e.g., cars) could not be built without a missing chip.
These problems took years to resolve, despite significant financial incentive, because it
takes that long for a fab to change the chips it makes or for new fabs to be built.
• Inaccessibility, due to cost: the minimum cost to make a single new custom chip,
ordered from an existing fab, is typically at least tens of thousands of dollars7. Building
even a minimal custom fab from used tooling is even more expensive. This limits chip
design to large companies. Well-funded startups can only afford one or two tries to
make a working chip, and this is even harder for researchers or hobbyists (who are
also affected by the multi-month times required to make anything, including MEMS).
5As of 2024 we are running out of further iterative improvements to make to microfabrication, slowly
leading arguably to the end of Moore’s Law. The effect this will have on the industry is uncertain, although
microfabrication and computers are definitely here to stay. We share some thoughts in chapter 7.
6Wafers often spend half their time en route between tools as a consequence of queueing theory [10].
7For simple chips; recent nodes can cost millions. For details and references, see section 7.2.1.

Thus, unlike fields such as robotics or metalwork, where cheap kits and tools are widely
available to teach students, microfabrication has no ecosystem of slowly improving
amateur talent. It remains a niche activity despite its massive importance.
• Supply chain complexity, due to difficulty: the semiconductor supply chain has
become one of the most complex in the world [12], there are many possible points of
failure in a fab, and keeping up with the state-of-the-art requires increasingly fragile,
precise, and expensive microfabrication tools. The largest challenge in building a new
fab is often not the economics, despite its multimillion (or billion) dollar cost, but the
technical problem of setting up even a copy of an existing working fab [13].
These problems have inspired worldwide efforts such as the $52-billion-dollar 2022 US CHIPS
Act [14], which tries to address each of these by improving existing microfabrication.
At this point, we believe it makes sense to recognize that since microfabrication is simulta-
neously important yet difficult, it is worthwhile to spend at least minimal effort investigating
alternative fabrication processes not subject to the same time, cost, and difficulty limits8.
While it is unlikely we will be able to compete with the half-century of intense technological
effort that is microfabrication, an alternative can start small and might help in a subset of
cases—what if we could iterate minimal designs in days instead of months? What if build-
ing a single bad transistor only needed a desktop tool, not a warehouse-sized fab? What if
hobbyists could order simple custom chips as easily as PCBs today? Or will there never be
another way to make a million-transistor computer? It seems likely alternatives can exist as
there’s no law of physics prohibiting construction far faster and with far more precision than
microfabrication other than our skill in designing new ways to move atoms around [16][17].
Thus, in the grand academic tradition of asking difficult questions, we’ll follow this thought
and see if we get anywhere interesting.
So: in what ways other than the planar microfabrication process can we make high-resolution
multimaterial devices, both transistors and beyond?
1.2
Existing Microfabrication Alternatives
The reason we continue to use microfabrication despite its difficulty is we have no alternative
simultaneously capable of the multimaterial patterning and high resolution required to make
useful devices. But partial alternatives certainly exist. Here we list a number of manufac-
turing methods9 that can get close to microfabrication’s resolution and material capabilities
and, despite falling short of this particular goal, often find a niche for themselves.
8As the author, I admit a personal motivation: frustration with these limits of microfabrication while
teaching Berkeley’s EE143 microfabrication lab course or building MEMS devices [15] even in our excellent
research fab. It’s not fun to spend more time waiting for tools to finish then doing more useful research.
9The reader may be familiar with a distinction in macroscopic manufacturing tools between subtractive
and additive processes: a subtractive process, like woodwork or CNC milling, begins with a block of material
and removes mass to carve it to shape, while an additive process like welding or 3D printing adds material.
Although this division breaks down for more complex methods, microfabrication is arguably a combination
of repeated additive then subtractive cycles. The following processes, excepting FIB milling, are all additive
(or “direct write” [18][19]) as this more easily satisfies the requirement to use multiple materials.

1.2.1
Inkjet Printing
Inkjet printing is perhaps the most well-known of all alternative manufacturing methods
that pattern multiple materials with high resolution. Small liquid ink droplets are dispensed
through a small (microfabricated!) nozzle via mechanical pressure or thermal expansion.
Scanning the the dispensing head over a substrate while switching inks allows 2D multima-
terial printing. Many nozzles can be operated in parallel for fast printing—at the upper end,
200×103 nozzles across 40 printheads, each at 80×103 drops per second per nozzle, gives 16
billion drops per second [20][21] . It is possible to layer inks to build 3D structures [22][23].
However, despite these abilities, inkjets still can’t compete with microfabrication.
Figure 1.3: Left: the basic inkjet mechanism, in which liquid ink is expelled in droplets from
a micron-scale nozzle by piezoelectric mechanical pressure or thermal expansion. Center left:
an inkjet-printed full adder circuit [24]. Center right: printed thick insulating and conducting
inks makes a 3D coil onto which a connector is soldered [23]. Right: EHD printing achieves
250 nm resolution [25].
A large limitation of inkjets is that they only work with liquid inks within a certain viscosity
range.
This prohibits the use of standard semiconductor materials—for example, silicon
is only a liquid when molten above 1414 ◦C which is infeasible to work with10. Instead,
inks are generally polymer-based in a liquid organic solvent that evaporates after printing.
Conductive traces are possible by printing metal nanoparticles in liquid followed by sintering
[26][27], but semiconductors are limited to low-performance complex polymers and metal
oxides [24][28]. These material difficulties, compounded with reliability and accuracy issues,
have limited the largest inkjet printed circuits to about 100 transistors [24][28].
Inkjets also have a low resolution limit: the method cannot print well with resolutions below
about 20 µm (in printing industry terms, 1200 dots per inch).
It is possible to use the
spreading of droplets or chemical forces to achieve smaller features in one dimension [29].
Both resolution and viscosity limits can be improved by changing the deposition process to
electrohydrodynamic jet (EHD) printing, where an electric field pulls a liquid into a sharp tip
from which a smaller droplet is ejected [30]. This has been shown to reach 250 nm resolution
[25][31] and is commercially available at 1 µm [32]. But materials must still start in a liquid
phase and the reliability issues of clogged or spreading liquid inks are not improved.
10Most rocks are silicates, so molten silicon might be considered lava.

1.2.2
Resin 3D Printing and Two-Photon Lithography
Another category in high-resolution manufacturing is 3D printing methods that use liquid
polymer resins specially formulated to be light-sensitive to harden to a solid upon exposure to
the right wavelength. These can be solidified with a light pattern projected with conventional
optics (not unlike photolithography), in which case the process is called stereolithography
(SLA), or cured at the small focus of a laser, called two-photon lithography.
Figure 1.4: From left to right: resin printing techniques use focused light to create one layer
of a 3D object at a time, a small tubing adapter made with SLA next to a matchstick [33],
a multimaterial lattice printed by switching resin baths during an SLA print [34], and a
significantly smaller lattice made with two-photon lithography [35].
These printers are usually only capable of printing a single material at once, and that ma-
terial must be a light-sensitive polymer resin (a category even more restrictive than inkjet
ink). There is some limited multimaterial capability: it is tricky but possible to change
materials by moving the part under construction between multiple resin baths during the
print. Postprocessing a print with electroless plating can make conductive traces [34], and
piezoelectrics can be printed by embedding particles in the resin [36].
But these methods begin to approach interesting resolutions. While SLA 3D printing can
only achieve perhaps 10 µm minimum features, two-photon lithography printers, which for-
mulate their resin molecules to require absorption of two photons (not just one) to solidify
allowing the intensity of a focal point of a laser to draw below the light diffraction limit, can
regularly demonstrate almost 100 nm resolution [37]. This compares to photolithography
(though not precise sub-100 nm thin film deposition methods).
The main strength of these resin printing processes is their 3D geometry capabilities, which
can build photonic lenses [38] or MEMS actuators [39]. Microfabrication cannot make very
complex 3D structures as that would require many photolithography layers which vastly
increases fabrication time and cost11. However, the material limitations of resin printing are
far too strict for broader applicability in electrical devices.
11Though this has been done in limited circumstances. See [40], which “3D prints” complex sub-millimeter
metal mechanisms by microfabricating tens of layers of electroplated metal.

1.2.3
Aerosol Deposition and Cold Spray
Both inkjet and resin printing were limited primarily by their materials. There exists a
different category of fabrication methods capable of printing more interesting metals and
ceramics: small particles of material, either solids or liquid ink and from the nanometer
to micrometer scale, are shot onto a surface in an air jet. This is vaguely similar to the
sputtering or evaporation thin-film deposition methods of microfabrication, but faster, less
controllable, and with some ability to draw patterns instead of uniformly coating a surface.
Many varieties exist: cold spray [41], aerosol deposition [42], cluster beam deposition [43].
Figure 1.5: Left to right: a diagram of cold spray and aerosol deposition, which differ merely
in scale, a copper cable clamp printed by cold spray [44], a silver and polymer strain gauge
aerosol jet printed on aluminum [45], and 3 nm copper nanoparticles deposited into 3D shapes
by an electric field formed by crosses in a microfabricated mask [46].
Material capabilities are very good and comparable with microfabrication [47]—cluster beam
deposition has even been used as a microfabrication thin-film deposition tool [48][43]. It is
possible to use liquid inks [49] or solid metals and ceramics which deform then form covalent
bonds to the substrate (for details, see chapter 3) [50][51]. Multimaterial structures are easily
made via serial deposition. Cold spray methods are used industrially [41] to produce hard
ceramic coatings reaching over 90% of bulk properties and to 3D print large metal items
[52][42][44]. Transparent ceramics and piezoelectrics are possible [42], and mixing particles
gives material gradients [53]. Transistors have been aerosol jet printed with semiconducting
inks [54][55][56][57], and depositing pure and doped silicon works [58][47][59].
The main limit of these methods is resolution [60], which requires extremely precise airflow.
An aerodynamic lens is a particular fluid dynamic structure that focuses a given particle di-
ameter [61]; sufficiently good control allows resolution down to ≈10 µm [62] but is ultimately
limited by Brownian motion (section 4.2.1). Some promising experiments12 use electric fields
from charged masks to direct charged nanoparticles during deposition with sub-micron re-
sults [63][69][68], but this has not been explored fully or developed into a general printing
method. As we will see shortly, the method proposed in this dissertation is essentially aerosol
deposition with a better electrostatic focusing method bolted on top.
12These papers [46][63][64][65][66][67][68] were among the strongest a priori evidence that this dissertation’s
proposal could eventually work. [64] demonstrates minimum feature sizes as low as 35 nm!

1.2.4
Other Methods
Besides inkjet, resin printing, and aerosol deposition, there are many less common fabrication
techniques still worth mentioning [70]. Some scale to higher resolutions than microfabrication
with impressive capabilities, but all currently have some material or practicality limit that
has prevented their use for semiconductor device manufacturing.
Figure 1.6: Left to right: circuit traces from tungsten and SiO2 made with FIB [71], a statue
electrochemically printed in copper [72], geometrical patterns made from assembled DNA
molecules [73], and 48 iron atoms arranged on a copper surface via STM [74].
Focused beam tools: some methods electromagnetically focus a beam of electrons or atoms
in vacuum, then use the narrow beam to interact with the surface of a material [75][76]. This
includes scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), but the beam can locally initiate a chemical
reaction with a surrounding gas to deposit material [77] as in focused electron (or ion) beam
induced deposition (FEBID and FIBID)—or cure photoresist, in electron beam lithography.
A focused ion beam (FIB) tool etches away material. These methods can reach sub-10 nm
resolution but are very slow with limited material choices (e.g., no doped semiconductors).
Combination “multibeam” FIB, FIBID, and SEM tools are used commercially to investigate,
debug, and rewire small parts of microfabricated integrated circuits13 [71][78][79]. Extensions
of these methods have managed to deposit single atoms with sub-100 nm resolution [80]. All
these are similar to what we propose; see section 6.5.4 for a detailed comparison.
Spatial atomic layer deposition (ALD): standard ALD, which creates films of atomi-
cally precise thickness by repeatedly layering certain gas precursor molecules, is common in
microfabrication. By focusing these gases through a small nozzle scanned over a substrate
it is possible to draw 2D patterns [81][82][83][84] (for CVD: [85][86]). However, the chem-
istry limits materials to what chemical precursors are available, and the nozzle resolution
is a large 100 µm giving its atomically thin prints somewhat unwieldy large width-to-height
ratios, making any devices simultaneously wider and slower to make than is practical14.
Electrochemical printing: it is possible to deposit pure metals electrochemically [87] on a
substrate submerged in a liquid bath through a small (microfabricated) nozzle with near 1 µm
resolution [72][88]. Parallelism to print large objects is possible [89]. This method is restricted
to metals capable of electrochemical deposition, i.e., no insulators or semiconductors.
13A FIB tool was likely used to make the chip cross-section in figure 1.1.
14It is possible that spatial ALD/CVD makes a good companion method to this dissertation’s nanoparticle
printing process, which should be generally more capable but worse at controlling film thickness.
9
Laser direct write: like focused beam tools, a laser can induce local material deposition
[90]. Laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) directs a gas-to-solid reaction that can print
metal [91] but is very slow. In laser induced forward transfer (LIFT), a thin film of material
is suspended over a substrate where it (or a donor layer) is selectively hit by a focused laser
to expand and fly off onto said substrate [92]. This can work with a broad range of materials
including solid metals, but minimum resolution is typically limited to 1 to 20 µm.
DNA nanotechnology: in a dramatically different approach, it is possible to generate DNA
strands that fold in liquid solution into nanoscale structures with near 1 nm resolution and
atomic precision [93][94][73]. This makes millions of copies of the same structure, randomly
arranged. Significant research is in progress, but there is not yet a reliable way to make
electrical devices from these or connect them to even microfabricated circuitry.
Scanning probe lithography: in atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), a near atomically sharp tip is dragged over a surface with subatomic
resolution to image it. This can instead be used for fabrication by selectively heating a
substrate, transferring ink (“dip-pen lithography”), or even electrostatically pushing indi-
vidual atoms [95][96][74]. These methods reach the highest resolution of anything discussed
(comparable to or exceeding focused beam methods) and have been used to build parts of
transistors [97], but are impractically slow and generally only capable of moving a single
type of material at a time. Best used in combination with other methods.
1.3
Our Proposal: Nanoparticle Printing
We are now well-positioned to design a new fabrication method that avoids the limitations of
existing methods to achieve the multimaterial high-resolution capabilities that semiconductor
devices require.
In order to print standard materials—metals, semiconductors, and oxides—we’ll use vacuum
deposition similar to aerosol deposition or focused beam tools (or the physical and chemical
vapor deposition processes used in microfabrication itself). Methods that operate with or in
a liquid, like inkjet printing, two-photon lithography, and electrochemical printing, are too
strongly restricted by chemical compatibility and material properties of their liquids. The
ability to control the pressure, temperature, and composition of the environment around any
part under construction is much more likely to provide in high-quality results than remaining
in standard atmosphere or liquid.
To reach sufficiently high resolution, we’ll ignore the small nozzle approaches of inkjet and
electrochemical printing (which are limited to about 1 µm and can be unreliable due to
clogged nozzles), focused light methods like photolithography and two-photon lithography
(which are mostly diffraction-limited and constrain material properties), and gas jet focusing
of aerosol deposition (which is limited to 10 µm by Brownian motion and inability to more
precisely control fluid flow). We’ll instead use the electrostatic focusing found in EHD print-
ing and focused beam tools. This has no fundamental resolution limit as the electromagnetic
field scales well below atomic level; the final theoretical resolution (which will be sub-1 µm)
will come from other implementation details (chapter 6).
10
Specifically, we’ll try to make the following idea work: begin with nanoparticles (clumps of
atoms, as individual atoms would be too slow) of standard microfabrication materials, focus
these electrostatically in vacuum, and impact them onto a substrate, where they should meld
with the surface as in aerosol deposition methods. Switching between types of particles would
allow multimaterial prints. If successful, nothing should prevent manipulation and printing
of pure (and doped) semiconductor nanoparticles at very high resolutions.
Figure 1.7: A cartoon of the basic idea: nanoparticles are generated (left), focused and
accelerated in vacuum via electric fields between electrodes (gold, center), and finally shot
onto a substrate, which is moved by a motorized XY stage in two dimensions to draw a
pattern. Switching between types of nanoparticles would allow depositing different materials.
As we saw in the prior art, this idea is fundamentally similar to gas jet processes like cold
spray, aerosol deposition, and cluster deposition, but we add electric fields to focus particles
beyond the limits of fluid dynamics. It has been recognized that focusing resolution is the
main limit to using aerosol deposition for nanoscale manufacturing [60], and several groups
have previously proposed using electric fields for this [98][99][100][64][63], but none have
figured out an ideal general solution. As we will see, this thesis develops a more capable
electrostatic focusing mechanism that should achieve higher resolution. Our method is also
similar to focused ion beam tools (see section 6.5.4) but uses nanoparticles instead of single
atoms and at lower impact velocities.
In the rest of this dissertation, we’ll discuss our progress engineering each part of this system.
In chapter 2 we will see how to create nanoparticles in inert gas, and chapter 3 will theorize
what needs to be done to print them. Some minimal low-resolution but multimaterial depo-
sition is surprisingly straightforward with aerosols in chapter 4. To achieve higher resolution
we describe the process of electrically charging nanoparticles in chapter 5 as a prerequisite
for chapter 6, where we find electrostatic focusing mechanisms are common across particle
accelerators and mass spectrometry then design our own with techniques theoretically ca-
pable of printing with sub-1 µm resolution. Finally, in chapter 7, we will summarize our
results: although we didn’t manage to demonstrate a complete system or print a transistor,
we came close, showed partial success, and have a short roadmap toward a full demonstra-
tion with no major roadblocks. We’ll show this printing process has the potential to be
easier, cheaper, and faster than microfabrication for some limited applications, achieving
our original goal.

Chapter 2
Nanoparticle Generation
The first step in printing nanoparticles is to, well, somehow obtain nanoparticles. We’ll dis-
cuss what this means then detail our construction of two custom nanoparticle sources.
What is a nanoparticle? For our purposes, a nanoparticle is just a clump of atoms. Assume
it is roughly spherical and we can define its size by its diameter, which we’ll typically want
to be between 5 nm and 50 nm or so (in the nanometer range, thus “nanoparticle”). We’ll
use nanoparticles of all the same type of atom: all silicon or all aluminum, perhaps, though
sometimes we might use slightly doped silicon1 or an oxide like SiO2.
Figure 2.1: A cartoon representation of a simple example nanoparticle. Each gray sphere is
an individual atom. This is about 42 atoms wide, or perhaps 10 nm in diameter, with about
40000 atoms in total. Note many inorganic nanoparticles are small enough that their crystal
structure becomes monocrystalline or amorphous, not polycrystalline [101].
Nanoparticles are common [102]. Any aerosol, like smoke or fog, is simply small solid or liquid
nano (or micro) particles moving around in a gas. Many more complex biological molecular
structures, like viruses or organelles, could arguably be considered nanoparticles. For our
purposes, however, we’ll stick to spherical nanoparticles of a single solid material.
1This is important—it is why printing semiconductor devices with reliable doping should be possible.
12
Why do we want nanoparticles in particular? The trouble comes from our desire to place
small bits of matter serially. We could try printing single atoms one at a time, but that would
be slow2: even at a ridiculously fast 1 million atoms per second, even a tiny 100x100x1µm chip
would take multiple years to print, not to mention this is overkill as we probably couldn’t
place those atoms with atomic resolution anyway. We could speed this up at the cost of
spatial resolution by printing a cloud of several atoms hitting the same area at once3—but
at this point we might as well use nanoparticles, which we’ll see squish together on impact
to give a similar result (see chapter 3) and print faster than atoms when charged (see section
6.5.3). On the other hand, if we printed even larger clumps of atoms (say, 10 µm diameter),
we couldn’t get the sub-1 µm resolution we need for semiconductor devices.

Nanoparticle Generation Methods
Because nanoparticles are so prevalent, significant study has gone toward simple reliable
ways of making them. Breaking down larger material by physical grinding or aerosolizing a
liquid tends to make larger particles, but nanoparticles are small enough they can be grown
from individual atoms sticking to each other under the right conditions.
The most common particle generation methods include:
• Mechanical milling: Large chunks of material are ground down into powder via
mechanical action [104][105]. Resulting particles are larger than at least 100 nm as
smaller particles melt together (elaborated on below). Can be used to alloy materials
together (frequently used in metallurgy).
• Atomization: Also referred to as nebulization or aerosolization. Gas is blown through
a liquid, making small droplets carried as an aerosol in the gas [106]. Used for aerosol
deposition, paint guns, and air fresheners. It is also possible to atomize molten (liquid)
metal, which is a common way to mass-produce metal powder in industry [107], or even
2This has kind of been done, excruciatingly slowly: see [80] or [74], and section 6.5.4.
3Microfabrication thin-film deposition processes like evaporation, sputtering, and CVD arguably deposit
clouds of single atoms over an entire wafer (without patterning), in minutes to hours.
13
blow air through a metal powder instead of a liquid. All these result in fairly large
particle sizes in the micrometer range.
• Electrospray: A high voltage can be used to draw a liquid out from a narrow nozzle
(a “Taylor cone”) and break it into droplets [108][109]. This can make liquid nanoparti-
cles, but the liquid can also evaporate to leave molecular ions or nanoparticles that were
already in the liquid solution [110][111][30][112]. Commonly used in mass spectrometry
to remove molecules from a liquid solution. Slow compared to other methods4.
• Liquid nucleation: One of most reliable ways of making particles truly in the nanome-
ter size range. Atoms or molecules are dispersed in a liquid solution carefully engineered
so these atoms nucleate and stick together to grow nanoparticles [113]. Commonly used
in biomedical applications or research. Pre-grown nanoparticles in liquid are commer-
cially available in many different materials [114].
• Vapor nucleation: Also called gas phase nucleation, vapor synthesis, or aerosol syn-
thesis. Similar to liquid nucleation but in a gas. Commonly occurs in the atmosphere
(for example, cloud formation) [115][116], and making metal particles is possible. Can
even happen in microfabrication processes like CVD [117] or PVD [118].
Note several more methods exist to generate individual atoms as ions for focused ion beam
sources (see chapter 5 and section 6.5.4), but these are generally too small and the production
rate and efficiency too low for what we want.
Of all these methods, which do we choose? Vapor nucleation is the most promising.
Recall our materials need both very high material purity and dimensions below 100 nm. The
need for high purity to sometimes better than one part per billion (see chapter 1) by itself
rules out mechanical milling—which might contaminate particles with atoms worn off the
milling apparatus by mechanical contact—or atomization, liquid synthesis, and electrospray
methods, in which case the particle might be somewhat contaminated by the surrounding
liquid.
Vapor nucleation is a promising option because no atoms are involved save the
material we want and a background gas, which can be chosen to be an inert noble gas (He,
Ar, etc.) that should not react with the nanoparticles.
The nanoparticle size also matters significantly. Sufficiently small nanoparticles (below our
approximate threshold of 1 µm or so, not entirely coincidentally) react very easily with their
surroundings. Because of their size and geometry, a large fraction of their atoms are near
their surface with freedom to move. The resulting surface energies are much higher than
in bulk [119]. This also decreases the melting point of nanoparticles—in fact, nanoparticles
often melt into to each other slightly at room temperature. The result is that nanoparticles
packed together as a powder, like an everyday bag of flour5, will tend to agglomerate until
4We briefly tried electrospray, without much success. Dr. Williams of [111] informed us producing up
to 10k 100 nm particles per second is typical for use in charge detection mass spectrometry. That is a mass
rate of 1 × 10−3 mg h−1, 3 orders of magnitude slower than our spark ablation and laser ablation sources.
5The reader may be familiar with dust explosions from clouds of flour or metal. These are a result of
particle surface reactivity: an exothermic reaction with a surrounding gas, multiplied by the large surface
area of a collection of particles, is a significant amount of energy. Dust explosions are often from more easily
manufactured microparticles; nanoparticles, due to higher surface energies, would be worse.
14
their clumps reach at least micron size scales6 [120]. In order to store nanoparticles, we’ll
need to either keep them in a liquid (which has contamination concerns, as noted previously)
or levitate them in a gas. This last option best fits vapor nucleation.
2.1.1
Vapor Nucleation
This is how vapor nucleation creates nanoparticles [121][122][123][124]:
The material we want to make nanoparticles of is first vaporized into a cloud of its constituent
atoms. This is easy enough to do by any of several methods: add enough energy and any
solid or liquid will evaporate, sublimate, or otherwise break up into a gas or plasma.
As this cloud of atoms cools down, it loses thermodynamic stability (is supersaturated), at
which point multiple effects occur at different rates: atoms condense and form clusters (an-
other name for very small nanoparticles with mere tens of atoms), these clusters collide and
coagulate into larger clusters (which coalesce into uniform crystalline structures), and some
atoms evaporate off existing clusters to make them shrink again. These processes happen
simultaneously at different rates. According to classical nucleation theory, which compares
the growth of cluster surface area (increasing instability due to evaporation) vs. volume
(increasing stability from bulk energy), clusters become stable and continue to grow above
a critical diameter; below this they dissipate [43][125][126][127]. The result is a distribution
of particle sizes (often lognormal [128][102]) around some nonzero mean value. Particles are
mostly rather chunky polyhedra but are close enough to spherical for our purposes.
This can work in vacuum [47][43] but also in gas7 (preferably an inert gas that does not
react). This gas can modify the process by, e.g., adjusting the cooling rate or atom collision
frequency. It is also possible this gas reacts with the nanoparticles to add an oxide layer or
other coating, possibly making multimaterial nanoparticles [60][128], and trace contamina-
tion levels can be maintained below the limits required in microfabrication [129]. As we will
see in chapter 4, using a gas medium also lets us conveniently move nanoparticles.
Many options exist to implement vapor nucleation [130][101]. The atom vapor can be gener-
ated by directly heating a solid [131], magnetron sputtering [132], electrical joule heating, or
a laser, and the resulting cloud moved though assorted pressure differentials and geometries.
Accurate quantitative analysis of nucleation is possible but somewhat involved [125], so for
purposes of this work we’ll start with trial and error based on existing literature results.
In order to develop our proposed nanoparticle printer, we began by building a spark ablation
nanoparticle generator but eventually switched to laser ablation to improve consistency,
material capability, and system compatibility.
6Selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printing, which melts together layers of metal or plastic powder with
a laser, is limited in resolution by its particle diameter, which cannot be below 1 µm for this reason [120]. If
we successfully print nanoparticles, we will have turned this previously undesired effect to our advantage.
7This nucleation process also works in liquid—that’s what aforementioned liquid nucleation is—and is
closely related to how crystals grow in general.
15
2.2
Spark Ablation
As the first step in developing a nanoparticle printer, we built a spark ablation nanoparticle
generator as a source with which to test nanoparticle manipulation and printing.
Spark ablation begins with repeated electrical spark discharges between two electrodes of
the desired material. The large current of each spark through a small area on the surface of
the electrodes results in localized joule heating, vaporizing that part of the electrodes, from
which vapor nucleation proceeds. A background gas at significant pressure is required for
the initial spark and can also carry the nanoparticles away to a point of use.
Figure 2.2: A minimal cartoon illustrating spark ablation nanoparticle generation. A spark
locally heats and vaporizes two electrodes, the vapor from which condenses into nanoparticles
which are pushed along in a gas flow.
This method was first introduced in 1988 [133] and has since seen wide use [134][128][68]
with little change to its fundamental principles8. Its advantage is simplicity9: the only equip-
ment required for a minimal system is several electrodes and tubing assembled with merely
millimeter precision in atmosphere and a small high-voltage circuit. Metal nanoparticles
are easy, and spark ablation has also been shown to make doped silicon nanoparticles [58].
Although the electrodes must be conductive so creating insulating nanoparticles directly is
not possible, metal nanoparticles can be oxidized if the surrounding gas contains oxygen
[128], giving us all the basic materials semiconductor devices need.
We constructed the system shown in figure 2.3. The spark discharge apparatus itself is held in
an airtight KF-25 6-way cross vacuum fitting to allow control of pressure and gas movement.
Two metal electrodes of the material we want to create nanoparticles out of and about 1 mm
in diameter are held in miniature brass drill chucks, which are connected to custom vacuum
feedthroughs built of stainless steel KF-25 fittings, copper wire, SLA 3D printed parts from
Formlabs Durable resin [135], and Loctite Hysol 1C epoxy10. The electrodes are connected
to external spark circuitry by alligator clips11 on the feedthroughs. The electrodes can be
8Spark ablation generators are commercially available from [51] (a company founded by Dr. Schmidt-Ott
of [133] and [128]). These off-the-shelf generators are well-engineered with optimized electrode geometry and
improved circuitry but cost (quoted) $80k each. We chose to build our own for better system integration,
to more easily handle multiple materials in the future, and to avoid dwarfing the rest of the nanoparticle
printer cost as tabulated in section 7.2.1.
9Contrast this with cluster beam synthesis methods, which more conventionally heat metals to increase
their vapor pressure and need a high vacuum [43], or laser ablation which needs a sufficiently capable laser.

removed and replaced by unfastening the KF-25 clamps holding them to the 6-way cross
and are adjusted until the gap between the electrodes is 1 mm to 2 mm12. We were thus
able to change the electrode material to anything in a thin cylindrical form factor including
off-the-shelf copper, steel, and gold wire13, or even pieces of a shattered p-type silicon wafer
fit into the chuck14.

12While this worked, we recommend future engineers build a system to more easily finely adjust the
distance between these electrodes, which is an important quantity in spark behavior.
13A 55 mm long 0.38 mm diameter 24K (0.9995 purity) gold wire was purchased from an eBay vendor
for $29, equal to the raw material cost plus a significant markup. This demonstrates the extreme material
efficiency possible in nanoparticle printing (elaborated on in section 7.2.3). A minimal microfabrication gold
evaporation or sputtering target needs to be significantly larger and thus often costs $10k or more.
14Cylindrical silicon rods are available but much less common than flat wafers, especially in electrical
semiconducting grades. This is another point in favor of laser ablation, which can use flat material targets.
17
Perpendicular to the electrodes are two aluminum tubes of 4 mm inner diameter, each about
1 cm from the electrode centerpoint. One tube about 150 mm long connects to a vacuum
chamber continually pumped to a steady-state pressure of about 1 Torr (below 1% of at-
mospheric pressure, 760 Torr), while the other is about 100 mm long and connected to a
needle valve (and rotameter for flow measurement) to atmosphere. Air is continually pulled
at about 1 L min−1 through the needle valve, past the spark discharge electrodes—where it
hopefully picks up nucleated nanoparticles from spark-generated vapor—and into the vac-
uum chamber. Note replacing air with argon would reduce oxidation, but in both cases our
small nanoparticles should primarily follow the airflow rather than gravity (see chapter 4).
We estimate the pressure of the air around the spark electrodes to be between 0.5 and 1
atmospheres. An ideal setup might increase this pressure up to several atmospheres of pres-
sure, which results in higher breakdown voltage15 and spark energy and thus more material
vaporized and a higher nanoparticle generation rate [136].
The next step is to create sparks between the electrodes. A spark can be created by applying
a high voltage that exceeds the breakdown voltage of the surrounding gas at its pressure and
distance, which is given by Paschen’s law as in figure 2.4. The resulting electron avalanche
makes a conductive plasma pathway that short-circuits the electrodes, causing a large current
and significant heat. The longer this current can be sustained, the larger the spark16. Repeat
this process to continually generate nanoparticles.
Figure 2.4: A graph of Paschen’s law, which gives the voltage required to cause gas breakdown
via electron avalanche (Townsend discharge) between two electrodes at a given pressure and
distance (which are not independent). Curve data (from [137]) is approximate; these curves
can vary significantly [138]. At high pressures, the lower gas mean free path requires a larger
voltage to accelerate electrons to avalanche energies. At low pressures, there are too few
stray electrons and gas atoms to produce an avalanche. Our spark discharge setup is slightly
to the right of center. Note also there is never breakdown below a minimum of a couple
hundred volts even if electrodes are very close together. This will be important in chapter 6.
15The dependency of spark behavior on pressure means the pressure cannot be varied solely to optimize
nanoparticle nucleation. This is another downside of spark ablation that laser ablation does not share.
16This is a miniature lightning bolt.
18
We created these sparks with the circuit of figure 2.5.
An XP Power FS20-12 2kV DC
5mA power supply was connected in parallel with a 47nF high voltage capacitor and the
spark electrodes. The power supply slowly charged the capacitor until it exceeded the gas
breakdown voltage, typically around 1.5 kV, at which point the full charge of the capacitor,
around 50 mJ, was discharged in a spark. Increasing spark energy should increase vaporized
material and, somewhat, particle size [136][134]. This process repeated at about 10 Hz to
20 Hz, with random fluctuations [136], rate limited by the power supply current. Nanoparticle
production rate is proportional to frequency; the literature exceeds 150 Hz [136].
Safety note: high voltage is dangerous. The low kilovolt level and 50 mJ spark energy
used here is enough to potentially cause electrical injuries. As safety measures, high
voltage wires were placed safe distances apart to avoid breakdown in air between wires,
the vacuum chamber was connected to earth ground, a bleeder resistor discharged the
capacitor, and the system was completely disconnected when not in use.
Figure 2.5: Top left: picture of a spark between electrodes seen through viewport. Bottom
left: spark circuit diagram. Right: measured voltage across electrodes vs. time (albeit at a
lower pressure and voltage than typical), showing multiple sparks with variable timing.
At this point we almost have all the hardware required to implement spark ablation except
that we are missing a way to detect and measure the resulting nanoparticles to know whether
it worked. This is nontrivial as each sub-100 nm particle is too small to be visible in the 1 µm
diffraction-limited resolution of an optical microscope and even a cloud of nanoparticles in
gas is still too diffuse to be seen. Instead, the standard tool for nanoparticle and aerosol
detection and measurement is a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) from aerosol science
[102]. A DMA takes as input a stream of nanoparticles in gas (precisely like we hope to make),
electrically charges these nanoparticles (typically via radiation-based diffusion charging; see
chapter 5), then detects an electric current from particles hitting a conductive plate (a
19
Faraday cup). Carefully deflecting particles with an electric field allows only a subset of
particles with a particular air drag mobility coefficient to be detected, and scanning over
these subsets produces a histogram of nanoparticle diameters.
But although DMAs are
widely used in the literature [136], we were not able to access one. This does not matter too
much yet—this project’s focus is on nanoparticle deposition and manipulation; the particles
themselves can be characterized further in future work.
Instead, we chose to directly deposit nanoparticles on a surface where a sufficiently large
deposit built up over time should be visible and perhaps measurable via optical or electron
microscope. This is also a common practice in aerosol science, where it is called impaction
[102] (and is also the principle behind aerosol deposition): nanoparticles are either caught
in a gas-permeable filter or shot out of a nozzle where their inertia suffices to make them
impact a surface (for more details, see chapter 4). We implemented these methods by adding
a filter17 or a 0.21 mm ID nozzle 1–3 mm from a substrate, respectively, to the setup vacuum
chamber as shown in figure 2.6.
After initial filter paper tests, we continued only with
nozzle-based impaction to allow the use of many kinds of substrates.
Figure 2.6: Left top and bottom: cartoons illustrating aerosol collection via filter or im-
paction, respectively. Center: nanoparticles moving through metal tubing from spark abla-
tion generator into secondary vacuum chamber are captured by a filter attached to the open
tube end. Right: the filter is replaced by a dispensing needle placed several millimeters from
a substrate (that could be any flat surface but here is actually a custom XY stage).
We are finally ready to test nanoparticle generation. As pictured in figure 2.7, we began
with copper electrodes and observed reliable deposits on filter paper, steel, and silicon after a
deposition time of tens of seconds. Gold deposits well on steel but not glass, in which case it
adheres to itself but flakes off the substrate. This is frequently seen in standard microfabri-
cation due to gold’s inability to oxidize; an adhesion layer of chromium or titanium is placed
between SiO2 and gold. All these are excellent signs: we successfully transferred material
from electrodes to substrate and can conclude nanoparticle (or microparticle) generation is
at least minimally functional.
17As filter paper we used Filtrete Ultra Allergen vacuum bags, which claim to trap 99% of airborne particles
1 µm or larger. For a more repeatable result, [58] chose Millipore Durapore 0.45 µm PVDF filters.

spark discharge electrodes. SEM EDS analysis suggests the black film may be carbon.
Now that we have a working spark ablation nanoparticle generator, we can perform at least
some minimal characterization as previously noted before continuing to study nanoparticle
movement in later chapters.
21
Rate measurement: we approximated the production rate by measuring copper electrodes
(figure 2.8) before and after generating nanoparticles for 1 hour (spark rate 1 Hz to 5 Hz).
We found a total mass loss of 0.6 mg, i.e., nanoparticles are made at 0.6 mg h−1 (if 10 nm,
3.5 × 1010 particles/s). The literature, using a better spark power supply capable of 100 Hz
operation, reports anywhere from 1 to 30 mg h−1 [136]. This is a good sign we have success-
fully replicated the prior art. These are also convenient numbers for microfabrication: at
only 0.6 mg h−1 a reasonably sized 10x10x0.01mm chip18 could be printed in 15 hours.
Nanoparticle size: as stated earlier, the nanoparticle size distribution can be approximated
by analysis of deposits. We impacted copper nanoparticles on a clean silicon wafer for 2 min
to create the large deposit pictured in the bottom center of figure 2.7. Based on that image
as well as the SEM19 results shown in figure 2.9, it appears the majority of particles fell
below ≈100 nm and formed a thick solid (and cracked) film; a minority of particles were
1 µm to 10 µm in diameter. This is excellent: we are generating sub-micron particles and
future work should be able to characterize and control this further.
Figure 2.9: Left: SEM image of copper deposit on silicon. Observe the thick cracked film
in the center and some larger particles near the top. Center: energy dispersive x-ray spec-
troscopy (EDS) image showing elemental composition. Blue is Si, green is O, red is Cu:
apparently the copper is heavily oxidized (as expected due to our use of air; see section
4.3.3). Right: close-up SEM image of deposit center showing a cracked film presumably
formed of agglomerated sub-100 nm particles plus several larger particles.
Although our spark ablation nanoparticle generation appears to be a success, the method
has several problems. First, it cannot create insulating nanoparticles without inconvenient
gas-phase oxidation reactions [128]. Second is its inconsistent generation rate: nanoparti-
cles are generated in groups at each spark instead of in a continuous stream. Finally, the
sparks creates very significant20 electromagnetic interference (EMI). These limitations all
have workarounds (conductive particles can be oxidized, particles can be buffered into a
steady stream, and EMI can be shielded), but were enough to prompt us to experiment with
a second vaporization method: laser ablation.
18This is typical. Chips made with the SkyWater SKY130 130 nm microfabrication process are 12 µm of
transistors and wiring atop a silicon substrate [139], and most chips are several millimeters on a side.
19After testing the sample to ensure no particles would be released into the SEM chamber as required by
its maintainers. We chose to minimize SEM usage for the rest of this dissertation over these concerns.
20We observed 9 V oscillations on a nearby 12 V DC lab power supply due to spark-generated EMI.
22
2.3
Laser Ablation
We implemented a laser ablation nanoparticle generator after finding the previously men-
tioned limits of spark ablation. This laser-based process is very similar. Instead of vaporizing
electrodes with joule heating from a spark, material targets are instead vaporized by a laser;
the rest of the apparatus can remain identical. Compared to spark ablation, EMI should be
insignificant, the generation rate more constant, and material capabilities broader.
Figure 2.10: A simple cartoon illustrating laser ablation nanoparticle generation. A laser
of the correct wavelength and intensity heats and vaporizes material, which condenses into
nanoparticles which are pushed along in a gas flow.
This method is widely used with a variety of conducting, semiconducting, and (unlike spark
ablation) insulating oxide materials [140] and has existed since at least 1981 [141][142]. The
fundamental laser vaporization process is the same as used in laser cutting and machining
[91] since 1962 [143]: a laser is absorbed in a material, generally via exciting electrons, and
the energy is quickly coupled to the surrounding nuclei as heat21. If the incoming laser
power is sufficiently larger than the rate at which heat is conducted and spread throughout
the material, part of the material will become hot enough that it vaporizes. The material
target can be a flat surface or a microparticle aerosol [147][148][149].
For our purposes, we need only that the laser (a) is of the correct wavelength to be quickly
absorbed and (b) has peak intensity sufficient to heat material to vaporization. Metal ma-
chining most most commonly uses 1064 nm wavelength lasers [150], and higher intensities can
be achieved by pulsing the laser (in nanoseconds or shorter) instead of a lower constant aver-
age power (“continuous wave”). The laser ablation source of [142] used a 1064 nm Nd:YAG
pulsed laser (5ns and 10–30 mJ per pulse) to evaporate metals within a helium carrier gas at
1 to 2 atmospheres of pressure. Adjusting gas flow controlled nucleation conditions.
Historically, these lasers have been rather expensive (above $10k), but diode-pumped solid
state (DPSS) lasers have recently become significantly cheaper and accessible. We acquired
an xTool 1064 nm DPSS laser module designed for metal etching [151] with 2 W average
optical power, 15 kW peak power, 20 kHz pulse rate, 7 ns pulse width, and 100 µJ per shot
for less than $400 new. Its stock lenses produce a 30 µm diameter spot size with 20 mm
throw and perhaps 1 mm depth of field. It is controlled by a standard 3.3 V PWM signal
and 24 V power supply, making it easy to integrate into our own custom systems.
21There are minor variations to this basic physical process, e.g., a sufficiently intense and fast (femtosecond)
laser can completely strip electrons via thermionic emission before they transfer heat elsewhere, and the
remaining positively-charged nuclei undergo Coulomb explosion [144][145][146].
23
Safety note: high-intensity lasers are very dangerous as they can easily blind you.
Above around 500 mW optical power (a class 4 laser), even scattered light can cause
eye damage. The 1064 nm 2 W pulsed laser used in this work is easily in this category.
To ensure safety, we built a full enclosure around the laser, added safety interlocks to
only turn on the laser with the enclosure closed and software in the correct state, and
ran it only when wearing high-quality laser safety glasses (ThorLabs LG10) rated to
bring the worst-case intensity below maximum permissible exposure limits.
Figure 2.11: Top: CAD models of laser ablation nanoparticle generator, some with cover
removed to show interior workings. Bottom left: assembled laser generator. Bottom center:
material targets can easily be moved out of generator to be changed out with different
materials. Bottom right: rotation causes the laser to etch a characteristic circular trace.
Similar to our spark ablation nanoparticle generator, we designed an airtight chamber with
4 mm ID gas tubing input and output. A 1064 nm-transparent borosilicate glass disc allows
24
the laser to enter the chamber and hit a material target in a 10 mm wide space between the
tubing. All material targets are flat discs 10 mm to 25 mm in diameter which are easy to
acquire. Because the laser is focused on a sub-1 mm2 spot much smaller than the targets, it
is typical to use some system to scan the laser across the target surface [142][140]. We built
a motorized rotary two-axis scanning mechanism. The result is the system shown in figure
2.11. This was attached to a nanoparticle impaction setup similar to the spark ablation
generator but with a larger vacuum chamber described in section 4.3.
As an initial experiment, we scanned the laser across a copper target at 0.3 mm s−1 at 50%
of its maximum power for a total time of 15 s, impacting the result onto glass. The result
is shown in figure 2.12: this created a large 700 µm deposit implying copper nanoparticles
were successfully generated, transported, and impacted. This speed is comparable to (if not
faster than) our spark ablation nanoparticle generator results.
Figure 2.12: Left: copper deposited on a glass slide. Right: a close-up view showing the
deposit may have 100 µm tall topography at its center.
Figure 2.13: Left: material targets. Clockwise from top left: copper, aluminum, titanium,
black acrylic (PMMA), alumina, gold, silver, platinum, silicon. Right: materials impacted
onto glass slides. All materials work save for alumina. The PMMA deposit is barely visible.
25
Given our initial success with copper, we next tested a wide range of materials. Our generator
was constructed to allow quick and easy material changes by swapping out the material target
to any flat disc of diameter below 25 mm, letting us try the following: copper (101 alloy,
99.99% Cu, McMaster-Carr), aluminum (1100 alloy, > 99% Al, McMaster-Carr), titanium
(99.995% Ti sputter target, ACI Alloys Inc), black acrylic (PMMA), alumina (96% Al2O3,
remainder SiO2), gold (2024 Armenia 1 gram gold 100 Dram Noah’s Ark BU coin)22, platinum
(2024 Austria 1/25 oz platinum Philharmonic BU coin), silver (2024 Armenia 1/4 oz silver
100 Drams Noah’s Ark coin), and silicon (boron p-doped wafer).
Each material was etched with the laser moving at 10 mm s−1 over the surface and at 50%
maximum power.
Gas flow rate was set to approximately 0.5 L min−1.
Deposition was
continued for 1 min for each sample onto a glass slide. The results are shown in figure 2.13:
copper, silver, gold, and platinum produced dark deposits. Titanium, aluminum, and silicon
produced white deposits. Alumina produced no visible deposit, and PMMA resulted in a
very faint deposit with uncertain molecular structure. These are excellent initial results;
it appears laser ablation nanoparticle generation works, and future characterization and
improvement efforts can likely make a reliable convenient nanoparticle source.
We did attempt to quantify the nanoparticle production rate by measuring the mass change
of both the material target and substrate during the material experiments of figure 2.13 but
found no measurable difference above 0.1 mg over our 1 min deposition time23. This implies
the generation rate is below 6 mg h−1, but the similarity of deposits to our spark ablation
results suggests the generation rate is at least 0.6 mg h−1. This rate, between 0.6 mg h−1 to
6 mg h−1, is again reasonable for printing chips in hours.
2.4
Metrics and Improvements
We are now able to generate nanoparticles via either spark ablation or laser ablation and
are ready to proceed with considering their deposition in chapter 3. However, we have only
achieved the bare minimum. Although we can generate particles, we only have rough proxy
measurements of their diameters and other properties. While this is fine for the moment—
we thought it more important to confirm we can print nanoparticles before spending time
refining the nanoparticle sources themselves—this characterization and refinement is an ideal
target for future work.
An advanced nanoparticle printer might add the following:
Nanoparticle characterization: we would like to know the precise distribution of nanopar-
ticle diameters as well as their shape, optionally using this to optimize the ablation and vapor
nucleation processes—are the particles crystalline? Are they actually spherical or instead
multiple smaller particles necking together? Are they oxidized? As mentioned earlier when
22Gold, silver, and platinum are most readily available in a flat cylindrical form factor as minted coins.
We chose the cheapest coins commercially available of sufficiently large diameter. Costs were < $100 on
average per metal, making this as affordable as spark ablation wire and again significantly cheaper than
microfabrication material sources which typically have to be much larger.
23Longer deposition times were not attempted for fear of overheating the laser module.
26
we approximated particle sizes from SEM images, precise size distributions can be better
measured via a differential mobility analyzer (DMA), a cascade impactor (which uses a com-
bination of aerodynamic lenses and inertia to similarly select particles of a certain diameter
[102]), or charge detection mass spectrometry [111]. Size as well as particle geometry can be
determined to some extent by inspection of particles with a scanning or tunneling electron
microscope (TEM) [149] or atomic force microscope (AFM) after deposition.
Nanoparticle size control: to make a very precise and repeatable manufacturing method,
it would be preferable to control (and not just measure) the distribution of nanoparticle
sizes—perhaps we want nanoparticles of exactly 5±0.5 nm. However, all discussed nanopar-
ticle generation methods result in a wide distribution of particle diameters (say, a lognormal
distribution [128][102] from 5 nm to 30 nm) and more precise control is notoriously difficult
and may not be possible without using a process other than vapor nucleation. But there
is an alternative: it is relatively straightforward24 to sort particles by diameter in the same
DMA or cascade impactor tools used for characterization, a similar but less precise virtual
impactor [102], a time-of-flight filter based on mobility in gas [152], or a quadrupole mass
filter as used in mass spectrometry and discussed in section 6.3.2 [132][153]. We can simply
select the subset of nanoparticles of the correct diameter to print and recycle the rest.
Deposition efficiency: ideally 100% of the material vaporized from target electrodes is
transformed into nanoparticles and deposited onto the substrate. That this is theoretically
possible is a strong benefit of nanoparticle printing that is not possible in microfabrication,
where a significant fraction of material (easily far above a majority, depending on how one
calculates) goes to waste (see section 7.2.3). This efficiency can be quantified by measuring
the mass of a target material and deposition substrate before and after moving material
from the former to latter. One spark ablation paper in the literature [136] found a 22–38%
efficiency, i.e., at least 62% of vaporized material was lost by deposition onto tubing sidewalls
before being deposited as desired on the substrate, but noted this is mainly due to diffusion
and can be reduced by increasing gas flow to minimize transfer time.
All these results and possibilities make us confident that precise reliable multimaterial
nanoparticle sources are feasible and practical.
With that determined, we are ready to
consider what happens to nanoparticles after they are made: how we will deposit them
and how this can be achieved by manipulating them with a combination of gas drag and
electrostatic forces.
24The company [51] that sells a spark ablation generator also sells an aerosol-based particle size selector
with claimed 0.1 nm diameter resolution for 1 nm to 10 nm particles.
27
Chapter 3
Deposition Theory
Now that we have nanoparticles, we can get to the fun part: printing.
More specifically, we need to consider what physical processes need to happen to attach
these nanoparticles to the substrate or part under construction. Understanding this is a
prerequisite for designing any printing mechanism. We’ll review the physics and literature of
similar nanoparticle deposition processes to find out what is possible and in what conditions
(e.g., nanoparticle impact speeds). We’ll then briefly discuss systems to move nanoparticles
around and conclude we should focus on the gas/aerosol and electrostatic systems we later
pursue in chapters 4, 5, and 6.
3.1
Deposition Review
When proposing our nanoparticle printing process in section 1.3, we wanted nanoparticles
to hit the surface of a part under construction, then stick. What does that mean? How does
that work? Most macroscopic things don’t spontaneously stick together.
Roughly speaking, the materials we’re interested in (metals, semiconductors, and oxides)
consist of individual atoms bonded equally to all their neighbors; they are near-infinite 3D
grids of atoms. Now suppose you were to take two pieces of the same metal with atomically
flat surfaces and push these flat pieces together with no air or grease or other contaminants1
in between. The atoms would line up, the electrons forming bonds would spread across the
now-nonexistent gap, and the pieces would meld together into one as if they were never two
separate parts [154]. In Feynman’s words [155], “there is no way for the atoms to “know”
that they are in different pieces”. This process is often called cold welding2.
In our case, we want to cold weld nanoparticles to larger surfaces, which turns out to be
particularly effective due to high nanoparticle surface reactivity (as in chapter 2).
1Another common contaminant is an oxide layer from the surface reacting with atmospheric oxygen.
2Why don’t we see this more often on the macroscale? It’s extraordinarily difficult to make metal surfaces
flat and clean enough, especially at large sizes. But galling on tight screw threads is in part cold welding,
and spacecraft can experience cold welding between their metal parts in vacuum.
28
We’ll begin by considering what happens when a nanoparticle hits a flat surface at some
velocity. Sometimes the nanoparticle will deform and cold weld to the surface. This inter-
action has been widely studied in several research areas that approach the same problems
from separate directions3. These methods mainly differ in particle size and impact velocity
(or, equivalently, the kinetic energy per atom of the moving particle before impact).
Figure 3.1: Assorted effects when nanoparticles hit surfaces, graphed by approximate particle
sizes and impact velocities. Kinetic energy is computed as KE = 1
2mv2 assuming particles
consist of 40 amu atoms. Thermal energy kBT at 25 ◦C is 26 meV. Single atomic bonds are
1 eV to 10 eV [103]. Inspired by similar graphs in [42] and [158]. See also figure 3.2.
Single atoms: suppose a single atom hits a surface [156]. This is a common part of many
microfabrication thin-film physical vapor deposition (PVD) tools (which have many atoms
impacting in parallel). If the atom was moving slowly, with some probability (the sticking
coefficient) it will form temporary bonds then move around on the surface with thermal
energy as an adatom. Eventually it may form a stronger bond. Many atoms make a thin film.
This describes evaporation and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [118] but applies to any low-
speed collision [159]. The structure zone model [160][161] notes a transition from porosity to
small then large grains with substrate temperature, and film stress varies significantly [162].
If the incoming atom velocity and thus kinetic energy were greater than kBT thermal energy
or the ≈1 eV of chemical bonds, the extra energy is enough to modify film properties slightly
[163]. This is also the regime sputter deposition tools typically operate in [164]. At even
higher velocities, the incoming atom has enough kinetic energy to collide with many atoms in
the substrate, sometimes making some fly off the surface (“sputter”) so material is removed
instead of added. This applies to ion milling, FIB, and ion implantation [75][1].
3For a broad overview, we can recommend the combination of [118], [156], [43], [42], and [157].
29
Clusters (1–10nm): the next smallest4 particles, clusters5, are clumps of several to several
thousand atoms, that is, small nanoparticles with diameters up to tens of nanometers. These
have a variety of behaviors similar to single atoms [43]. At low impact velocities, below about
0.1 eV per atom, these clusters merely bond as-is to the surface. Depositing multiple clusters
can stack them without deformation, making a porous film. However, increasing the impact
velocity and energy to 1 eV is enough to allow the clusters to deform and make solid films,
which are good enough to form metallic ohmic contacts and PN junctions [171][172][47].
Varying process conditions can produce amorphous, nanocrystalline, and polycrystalline
films [47] and, especially with a heated substrate, these clusters move around the surface
similar to single adatoms (but surprisingly far: up to microns [171]) and form epitaxial films
[173][174]. Higher velocities (10 eV per atom) begin to cause sputtering and erosion effects,
and even faster speeds with small clusters still gives ion implantation6.
Industrially, clusters in the erosion regime can be used to smooth microfabricated surfaces7
in gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) processing [176][48][177]. Cluster deposition [125] is less
common. It (specifically ionized cluster beam deposition, ICBD, from 1975 [178][47]) has
been used commercially for DRAM contact hole filling [179] but, in general, the complexity
of cluster sources [43] means it has no significant benefit over evaporation and sputtering
for standard microfabrication (for our printing process, however, using larger particles than
atoms is worthwhile to allow higher print speed in chapter 6).
Larger particles act progressively more macroscopically. Specifically:
Low-speed bounce (large particles below 100m/s): when a particle hits a surface
at low speeds, it can bounce8. Below ≈100 m s−1, there is not enough kinetic or thermal
energy available to reform bonds or bond the particle to the surface except for Van der Waals
forces, so the particle elastically compresses slightly then rebounds, its inertia overcoming
any minor surface attraction (unless it is so slow, perhaps below 5 m s−1 [157], that surface
attraction dominates [102]) [157][158][181][182][183]. Single atoms can somewhat bounce:
they adsorb then desorb from a surface (with sticking coefficient probability) [184].
Aerosol Deposition, Cold Spray (10nm–100µm): when particles larger than clusters
hit a surface at intermediate velocities, typically 100 m s−1 to 1000 m s−1, they can undergo
plastic deformation to conform to the surface while cold welding [42][185][41][52]. This works
at room temperature (though more heat helps) with only a partial temperature increase (not
necessarily to melting) at the collision point as kinetic energy is converted to heat [186].
There is both a material-dependent [187] minimum critical velocity (which can be predicted
with solid mechanics as the onset of shear instability) and maximum velocity (notably a bit
below the 1 eV per atom milestone) above which a particle fragments, does not fully adhere,
and leaves an impact crater (hydrodynamic penetration) [186][188].
4Deposition of organic molecules exists as soft landing in mass spectrometry [165][166][167][168][169].
5Clusters were widely studied in the 1960s through 1990s for their interesting physics [170][43]. This
research also led to vapor nucleation nanoparticle generation methods [142] and the C60 buckyball molecule.
6Molecular ion implantation used for shallow MOSFET doping is arguably a form of cluster deposition.
7EUV photolithography mirrors are smoothed with single argon atoms (ion beam figuring, IBF) [175].
8This is relevant for sub-1 µm tin droplets in EUV light sources [180].
30
Impacting these large particles over wide areas can produce thick solid films that exceed
95% of bulk density, are gas-tight, and have high optical transparency [185][42]. This is used
in the semiconductor industry to apply nanocrystalline yttria coatings to semiconductor
equipment plasma chambers [189] and to manufacture some sputtering targets. To clarify
nomenclature: aerosol deposition and cold spray are so called because the main method to
accelerate 10 nm–100 µm particles to impact speeds is as an aerosol in an air jet (see sections
3.3, 4.2.1). Cold spray is feasible at atmospheric pressures; the smaller particles of aerosol
deposition have higher air drag and require partial vacuum for deposition (see section 4.2.1).
Thermal spray methods are cold spray at high temperatures. Other names exist9.
High-speed erosion (above 1000m/s): sufficiently fast particles have enough kinetic
energy to vaporize a good bit of both themselves and the surface they impact. This is the
hypervelocity regime [197]. Hypervelocity acceleration of micrometer-scale particles is useful
for studying in-space micrometeoroid or cosmic dust impacts [198][199][157]. Particles above
1 mm and from low speeds to hypervelocity are common as kinetic projectiles.
3.2
Deposition Parameters
Given the above deposition regimes, what parameters should our proposed nanoparticle
printer use? The literature suggests four properties are most important to control deposition:
impact velocity, particle size, temperature, and material.
Figure 3.2: Left: what happens when a nanoparticle hits a surface? Right: depending on
their initial velocity, particles can cohere, deform, and meld together (molecular dynamics
simulations from [200]). This can be explained by noting that when a particle is at a given
velocity, all its atoms have that same velocity, and the kinetic energy of each atom (1
2mv2)
turns into heat on impact and is available to reform the 1 eV to 10 eV chemical bonds between
atoms. The total kinetic energy of the pre-impact particle is this multiplied by the (large)
number of atoms. 1 eV per atom is equivalent to about 2000 m s−1. See also figure 3.1.
Velocity: the most important parameter in any of these physical deposition processes is
the speed at which nanoparticles impact a surface (for us, the substrate and part under
construction). This is because deforming then bonding the particle to the surface requires
9Other names for air jet deposition include micro cold spray [190], hypersonic plasma particle deposition
(HPPD) [191][59][192][193][194][60], vacuum kinetic spray [195], and nano-particle deposition system [196].
31
reforming chemical bonds, which needs energy, and the most convenient source is the kinetic
energy of impact as in figure 3.2. According to figure 3.1, we probably want to choose impact
velocities between 100 m s−1 and perhaps 3000 m s−1. Because the ideal velocity varies with
material and particle size [188], we would ideally be able to precisely control the velocity
within that window to fine-tune deposition conditions experimentally.
Particle size: as mentioned in chapter 2 (and later chapter 6), printing larger nanoparticles
is faster than printing single atoms, and we’ll also see in chapter 4 that larger particles are
easier to focus to high resolutions. But there is a tradeoff: larger particles have more mass and
are harder to accelerate to the required impact velocities, and, of course, we can’t reach sub-
100 nm printing resolution if the particles are larger than 100 nm in diameter. The best size
range for our purposes—achieving high-quality materials with high resolution—is probably
1 nm to at most 50 nm, mostly within the cluster deposition regime that is known to be able
to deposit films with high-quality electrical properties. This is also (not coincidentally) the
size range the nanoparticle generators we built in chapter 2 are optimized for.
Temperature: kinetic energy is not the only source of energy for deforming and bonding
particles; thermal energy can also help. At an absolute temperature T, atoms vibrate with
energy on the order of kBT (where kB is the Boltzmann constant). At room temperature
T = 298 K ≈25 ◦C, kBT ≈0.026 eV, and at silicon’s melting point of T = 1687 K we have
kBT = 0.15 eV, sufficient to cause by itself the initial conglomeration in figure 3.2—which is
why silicon becomes liquid there (but note this is still less than the kinetic energy velocity can
deliver locally to the particle). Furthermore: both the substrate and particle can be heated.
Heating the particle doesn’t mean anything for a single atom but can provide significant
energy with larger particles as in cold spray (giving thermal spray methods) [186][188][192].
This is why single atom methods like evaporation purely heat the substrate as described in
the structure zone model [161]. What should we use? We’ll ignore particle temperature,
start with the substrate at room temperature10, and can eventually add capability to heat
up to the 500 ◦C used by Takagi for cluster epitaxy [47] (being aware that this might cause
adatom movement of up to microns [171], potentially reducing print resolution).
Material: although velocities and other parameters vary with material [188], our material
choices will mainly be determined by the requirements to build useful semiconductor devices
as described in chapter 1: metals, semiconductors, and oxides. Fortunately, these all appear
feasible with minimal variation. It might eventually be useful to also deposit polymers11 as
sacrificial release materials for MEMS devices, but we leave this for future work.
In conclusion: we suspect we need to move particles of 1 nm to 50 nm at velocities of 100 m s−1
to 3000 m s−1 and can eventually add temperature control. Varying parameters might allow
printing assorted materials with a variety of crystal structures: amorphous, nanocrystalline,
polycrystalline, and monocrystalline (epitaxial). This is exactly what we need to print our
desired multimaterial nanoscale devices—if we can achieve these high nanoparticle velocities
while simultaneously aiming the particles with high printing resolution.
10This will allow us to print on low-temperature substrates, like plastics.

3.3
Manipulation Methods
According to section 3.2, we might be able to achieve the high-resolution multimaterial
printing we want if we can shoot nanoparticles of 1 nm to 50 nm diameter at a substrate at
well-controlled velocities somewhere between 100 m s−1 and 3000 m s−1, and with positioning
accuracy below our final desired printing resolution, e.g., 1 µm.
But how can we do that? These are tiny particles (only tens of atoms wide), high speeds
(supersonic), and high resolutions (accuracy within ten thousand atoms)!
Of the four fundamental forces—weak and strong, gravity, and electromagnetism—the weak
and strong forces are irrelevant at these scales and gravity is far too small to be useful12.
We need to use electromagnetism somehow. This includes long-range electrostatic and mag-
netic forces, photons, and matter interactions (since all matter is simply atomic nuclei and
electrons held together by electromagnetism).
• Matter interactions: also called touching stuff. We could put some nanoparticles
on the end of a robot arm then move it extremely fast. But as noted in chapter 2,
we want to avoid having the nanoparticles contact anything else made of atoms before
deposition to minimize the chance those atoms rub off and contaminate the particles,
compromising the sub-part-per-billion atomic purity we require. It is difficult to have
good enough control of chemistry to reliably do better. But there is a notable exception:
many gases, especially the noble (inert) gases (helium, argon, etc.), are single atoms
or molecules that can impact nanoparticles without reacting.
• Photons (light): it is possible to move nanoparticles with photon momentum (optical
tweezers [201][202][203]), but simultaneously achieving velocity and resolution is tricky.
We will use photons instead for electrical charging in chapter 5.
• Electrostatics and magnetics: an electrically charged nanoparticle will experience
a force directly from electric or magnetic fields. This is promising. The nanoparticle
can alternatively have a nonzero magnetic moment, but this is harder to control.
That leaves us two options: moving our nanoparticles (otherwise isolated in vacuum) either
with gas atoms collisions somehow or with electrostatic forces.
This conclusion is well-
supported by the prior art13 in section 3.1: aerosol deposition, cold spray, and some cluster
methods [125] use gas to accelerate particles, while other cluster methods [47] and nanopar-
ticle hypervelocity tests [198] use electrostatic acceleration. We also used gas already in our
nanoparticle generators in chapter 2.
In chapter 4, we will discuss gas-based manipulation of nanoparticles and be able to demon-
strate some minimal multimaterial printing. But it will prove insufficient to reach the full
velocity and resolution we want, so we will turn to electrostatics in chapters 5 and 6.
12Any size particle falling a long 100 m distance in Earth-standard 9.8 m/s2 gravity in vacuum gains a
total kinetic energy of only about 0.0004 eV per atom compared to the 1 eV we need.
13Evaporation and MBE instead use thermal energy to release atoms from a solid of the same material,
but this neither scales up well to larger particles or allows efficient velocity control—the velocity distribution
is Maxwell-Boltzmann [118] instead of the single value we want. Sputtering uses gas impacts.
33
Chapter 4
Aerosols and Printing
As proposed in chapter 3, we will try moving 1 nm to 50 nm diameter nanoparticles by having
gas molecules collide with them, ideally accelerating the nanoparticles to precise high-speed
velocities (up to 3000 m s−1) with high spatial resolution (< 1 µm). If we succeed, we can
print them. How can we go about doing this? First consider how gas collisions work.
Figure 4.1: Cartoon of a single gas atom (or molecule) bouncing off the right side of a
nanoparticle. This causes the nanoparticle to move slightly to the left.
By a gas, we mean a collection of individual atoms1 moving around in what is otherwise
a vacuum. When a single gas atom hits a nanoparticle, it acts like a nanoparticle hitting
a large surface as in chapter 3. If the atom is unreactive and moving slower than perhaps
10 × 104 m s−1 ≈10 eV (often the case; larger velocities risk deforming or breaking the
nanoparticle [204], so we’ll avoid that), it will bounce off the nanoparticle and head in a
different direction. Conservation of momentum dictates this acts like macroscopic collisions
(just like billiard balls) and is at least partially elastic2, so the nanoparticle will be pushed
slightly away from the collision point. Repeat this many times (a nanoparticle is significantly
heavier than a gas atom, so it takes a while), and the nanoparticle can be pushed in whatever
direction we like. (The other relevant interaction is electrons can move between atom and
nanoparticle, which is usually negligible but will matter in chapter 5.)
1A gas can be molecules like N2, not just atoms, with little difference. We use “atom” for convenience.
2Although most collisions are specular (and elastic on average), the atom can temporarily adsorb (stick)
to the nanoparticle giving a diffuse reflection [184][205], and some energy can also be lost or gained from
vibrations (phonons) in the particle to bring it to mean gas temperature [206].
34
Unfortunately, we don’t have a way to precisely shoot gas atoms at a nanoparticle to make
it go exactly where we want3. Instead we’ll allow millions of gas atoms to randomly hit each
nanoparticle, and their average behavior will determine what happens. We will control the
overall gas behavior—fluid dynamics4—to indirectly control the nanoparticles.
An aerosol is exactly this: a collection of nanoparticles in a gas. Aerosols are very common;
examples include smoke, fog, steam, and clouds. Aerosol science [102], the study of aerosols,
has produced useful results and tools like the differential mobility analyzer (DMA) mentioned
in chapter 2. We’ll quickly discuss gases in general then focus on aerosol-specific results.
4.1
Gas Physics
We will briefly review some basic gas behavior. Consider a large number of gas atoms inside
an airtight chamber. The atoms move around, bouncing off the walls and each other just like
they bounce off nanoparticles. This is the kinetic theory of gases, and statistical mechanics
can be used to derive some useful average properties [102].
Figure 4.2: A 3D rectangular chamber holding gas atoms bouncing off the chamber walls
and each other. The mean free path is related to the average distance between gas atoms.
As with nanoparticles, each collision between gas atoms and the surface is elastic on average5,
so at nonzero temperatures the gas atoms never stop moving even if their velocity might
change on each bounce. The atoms’ range of velocities is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution and is fairly broad (some atoms move slowly; other quickly).
The average
velocity increases with temperature and with smaller gas atoms. Standard air is just the
particular gas consisting of about 78% N2, 21% O2, and some Ar, CO2, and other trace
elements, each part of which acts independently according to this same distribution.
3Atomic billiards! But collisions are only somewhat elastic on average; single shots might be unpredictable.
4In continuum mechanics, “fluid” refers to both gases and liquids since both continuously deform under
applied shear stress and otherwise act similarly.
5Collisions equilibrate the temperature of the gas and chamber until this is the case; the atoms of the
chamber surface vibrate according to their temperature and transfer energy to or from colliding gas atoms.
35
From the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution we can derive that the average kinetic energy of
the gas atoms (each moving in a random direction) at absolute temperature T is 1
2kBT in
each of the x, y, and z directions for a total of (again, in a random direction)
3
2kBT
(4.1)
where kB = 1.381 × 10−23 J K−1 = 8.617 × 10−5 eV K−1 is the Boltzmann constant.
At
25 ◦C, any gas atom has about 0.039 eV of kinetic energy. An argon gas atom, for example,
would move on average (root mean square velocity6) at 431 m s−1. Nanoparticles will also
randomly bounce around and eventually gain the same 3
2kBT kinetic energy, but this applies
to the entire particle (not its individual atoms), so a 10 nm nanoparticle would only move
at 2 m s−1.
This doesn’t help us achieve the high velocities (up to 3000 m s−1) we want
to accelerate nanoparticles to, and it might make positioning nanoparticles with sub-1 µm
resolution difficult. We’ll address this shortly as Brownian motion.
Also relevant is that gas atoms hitting a surface, whether it be part of the chamber sidewall
or the side of a nanoparticle, apply a force. The average force (over time) per area is the
pressure, which is often the best way to measure the number of gas atoms in the chamber.
These are related by the ideal gas law
PV = NkBT
(4.2)
where P is the absolute pressure, V is the total volume of gas, and N is the total number of
gas atoms. Normal Earth atmosphere is air at a pressure of about 101 325 Pa or 760 Torr7.
Removing gas molecules from the chamber reduces the pressure; if below atmospheric we call
it a vacuum. Pressure is always positive (achieving perfectly zero pressure is near-impossible),
and for some applications (including ours; see sections 4.2.1 and 4.3.3) the difference in
otherwise small pressures (say, 1 Torr and 1 × 10−7 Torr) can be significant.
The rate at which atoms hit a surface (creating a pressure) is the impingement rate
J =
P
p
2πmgkBT
(4.3)
where J (gas atom impacts per unit area per unit time) is the impingement rate and mg is the
mass of a gas atom. In standard 760 Torr atmosphere, the surface of a 10 nm diameter particle
is hit by about 9 × 1011 gas atoms per second. This is an extremely large number.
A final important parameter is the distance between gas atoms8. It is often more convenient
to use the average distance a gas atom travels before a collision with another gas atom. We
call this the mean free path ℓ, calculated by
ℓ=

(4.4)
where dg is the kinetic diameter of the gas atom, about 0.36 nm for Ar, N2, and O2 [103].

4.1.1
Nanoparticle Air Drag and Brownian Motion
Given how gases behave, we can now consider how they make nanoparticles move.
We’ll consider the simple case where a nanoparticle with initial velocity v suddenly appears in
the center of a chamber with gas otherwise in equilibrium at some pressure and temperature.
This will take us surprisingly far. Note this is equivalent to the case where the nanoparticle
has no initial velocity but the gas is moving with velocity −v on average. It is only the
relative velocity that is important.
If there are no gas atoms (zero pressure), the nanoparticle will of course move forever at
velocity v. But in a gas, the nanoparticle collides with the gas atoms, transferring its kinetic
energy to the gas until the gas temperature is raised and the system is at equilibrium. The
nanoparticle is slowed down until it has the same relative velocity as the surrounding gas
(plus its randomly-directed thermal motion from section 4.1). This is air drag9!
Air drag is the main interaction between a nanoparticle and a gas. As suggested in the
introduction to this chapter, if we make gas atoms move somewhere on average, air drag will
drag nanoparticles along (and if we move nanoparticles without moving the surrounding gas,
those nanoparticles will quickly slow down). If we want to precisely move nanoparticles, we
should quantitatively understand the effects of air drag as well as its interaction with the
previously mentioned thermal (Brownian) motion.
Other nanoparticle-gas interactions besides drag include chemical reactions (unlikely with
noble gases, common with oxygen) or exchanging electrons (important in chapter 5), and air
drag itself has many subtle effects (e.g., thermophoresis). We will ignore these for now.
There are two ways to analyze drag: bottom-up statistical mechanics calculations accounting
for how nanoparticles are randomly bumped around, or a top-down approximation10 that
treats the gas as a continuous viscous fluid. We’ll start with the latter.
Figure 4.3: Two ways to analyze gas-particle drag. Left: a particle moving to the right
experiences many collisions with gas atoms, each of which slightly redirects the particle
course and, on average, slows it down.
Right: as the number of gas atoms approaches
infinity (a continuum), collisions are averaged out so a particle moving to the right (shown
with gas streamlines moving to the left) has a straighter path but is still slowed down.
9Drag exists in all gases, not just air, but the term “air drag” is more common than “gas drag”.
10Navier-Stokes can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases with Chapman-Enskog theory.
37
The reader may be familiar with Stokes’ law, which says the force ⃗F due to drag on a sphere
of diameter dp moving at velocity ⃗v through a fluid of dynamic viscosity µ is
⃗F = −3πµ dp⃗v.
(4.5)
In other words, a particle moving relative to a gas experiences a force in the direction opposite
its motion, proportional to its current (relative) velocity, vaguely similar to friction.
This equation is derived by assuming the surrounding gas is a continuum, then simplifying
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations at low speeds around a sphere with a no-slip
boundary layer. The result is accurate11 for large everyday objects.
However, this equation is often incorrect for nanoparticles since they are much smaller than
the mean free path ℓbetween air molecules (compare ℓ= 70 nm in atmosphere to a 10 nm
particle) so the no-slip boundary condition does not hold. In other words, the nanoparticle
is so small the approximation that the gas is a smooth continuum breaks down. This is
quantified by the Knudsen number Kn =
ℓ
dp, the ratio of mean free path ℓto particle
diameter dp. Kn can be thought of as the degree of non-continuous fluid behavior and in our
case is much greater than 1, a region referred to as free molecular flow12 [207].
It is sometimes possible to add a term to Stokes’ law to compensate for small nanoparticle
diameters. Specifically, the Stokes drag force is multiplied by 1/C defined by
C = 1 + 2ℓ
dp
· (c1 + c2e−c3
dp
2ℓ)
(4.6)
where c1, c2, and c3 are empirical constants, approximately c1 = 1.17, c2 = 0.52, c3 = 0.78
for air [102][205]. This is called the Cunningham-Millikan-Davies slip correction factor and
has the distinction of being used in the Millikan oil drop experiment that demonstrated the
existence of charge quantization [208]. The downside of this method is limited applicability
due to the empirical fit (which assumes standard pressure and temperature air).
An alternate and more general method to compute the drag comes from a first principles
analysis of hard sphere collisions. There are many minor variations to this method; see [205]
for an excellent discussion. We will use the form (referred to as “Epstein’s Law”):
⃗F = −8 + πφ
12
r
2πmg
kBT Pd2
p⃗v = −β⃗v,
(4.7)
where ⃗F is the drag force, φ ≈0.9 is a constant indicating the fraction of diffuse vs. specular
collisions, mg is the mass of each gas molecule, kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and
temperature, P is the gas pressure, dp the particle diameter, and ⃗v the particle velocity. For
convenience, we will sometimes abbreviate this as the viscous damping coefficient β.
11Stokes’ law applies at low Reynolds numbers. Assuming continuum flow, a 10 nm particle at 3000 m s−1
in 25 ◦C 760 Torr air has Reynolds number Re = 2, well below the Re ≈2000 onset of turbulence.
12“Free molecular flow” also refers to the point at which the mean free path is larger than the vacuum
chamber holding the gas, which is not quite the case for most of our systems.
38
Advantages of Epstein’s law include a clear relation to temperature, pressure, and gas molec-
ular mass. The major downside is this only applies to the free molecular flow Kn ≫1 regime,
but this is satisfied for our nanoparticles in almost all cases13. Importantly, note the drag is
directly proportional to velocity as in Stokes’ law, just with a modified magnitude.
Figure 4.4: A comparison of Stokes, Cunningham, and Epstein drag models in 25 ◦C 760 Torr
air, where the mean free path is about 70 nm. Air drag of nanoparticles larger than the mean
free path (low Knudsen number) is modelled by Stokes drag, while Epstein drag is accurate
for smaller particles. Cunningham drag interpolates between the two.
Minor model refinements exist for additional accuracy14. Small nanoparticles might require
a lower Epstein φ parameter [184][205][213], and gas-particle temperature differentials might
require additional corrections [206]. If particles were larger we might want to add secondary
fluid continuum forces including the Basset force, gravity buoyancy, Magnus or Saffman lift
due to particle rotation or shear flow; Saffman forces help model aerosol deposition [50]. For
our smaller particles in large Knudsen numbers (and compared to the larger electrostatic
forces in chapter 6), we will ignore these (unless particles are nonspherical [102]) [214].
One additional effect we cannot ignore is diffusion due to Brownian motion.
Earlier, we noted there were two ways of calculating drag. The first is the simple velocity-
dependent force we just discussed, which we will refer to as viscous drag. The other method
accounts for each individual collision of a gas atom with a nanoparticle.
Gas atoms hitting a nanoparticle cause it to have jagged motion: short straight-line move-
ments changing directions upon each collision as shown in figure 4.3. With sufficiently many
gas atoms, the force on the particle almost averages out to viscous drag—but not quite15.
13A 10 nm diameter particle in 760 Torr atmosphere has Kn ≈7 ≫1, and Kn increases at lower pressures.
14See ion mobility spectrometry [209][210][211][212], which makes very precise nanoscale drag calculations.
15That gas collisions cause both drag and Brownian motion is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
39
The remaining motion is slow, random, and omnidirectional (though for a particle moving
quickly, it is more noticeable perpendicular to the particle’s primary direction of motion).
This is called Brownian motion or diffusion16 and is not accounted for in viscous drag. Given
time, a particle will move arbitrarily far from the path we would otherwise predict.
Brownian diffusion is very significant for small particles [102] but can be tricky to analyze
because of its large number of collisions and discrete nature. It does not have a single simple
analytical formula like viscous drag. There are several ways of dealing with this:
• Computer simulation of random gas collisions is accurate and also replicates viscous
drag but does not simplify analysis and is computationally expensive17 [215][216][217].
• Average Brownian motion (ignoring motion with viscous drag) can be probabilistically
but analytically approximated with Fick’s laws of diffusion.
• Brownian motion gives particles 3
2kBT mean kinetic energy. If a particle is trapped in
a potential energy field, this can give us a probability distribution for its position.
We’ll approximate particle motion as viscous drag plus independent Brownian movement
(this is the Langevin equation [217]) given by one of the latter two approaches.
Using diffusion, a statistical mechanics analysis [102] can find that Brownian motion makes
particles move an average (randomly oriented) distance18 (beyond viscous drag) of
xdiffusion =

In a 2D plane, a 10 nm nanoparticle diffuses 460 µm on average each second in atmosphere.
It is clear this will be important when we attempt to achieve sub-1 µm resolution.
16“Brownian motion” generally refers to the random movement of a single particle and “diffusion” to the
average behavior of a group. In this dissertation we will use both terms interchangeably.
17Recall we calculated a 10 nm particle has 9 × 1011 collisions per second in atmosphere.
18Specifically, the mean squared displacement is 2nDt where n is the dimension (1D, 2D, or 3D). Here we
are mainly concerned about 2D particle motion perpendicular to the main direction of travel.

4.2
Aerosol Transport
We’ve established that nanoparticles are moved with a gas flow according to a viscous drag
force (given by Epstein’s law) with simultaneous diffusion (Brownian motion). These laws
are enough to analyze particle motion in gas flow in tubing like we used in chapter 2.
First we’ll establish how long a nanoparticle takes to react to a gas flow [102]. As suggested
earlier, suppose a nanoparticle of mass m starts with velocity ⃗v0 relative to the surrounding
gas (for example, it is moving 10 m s−1 while the gas is still, or the particle is still while the
gas moves 10 m s−1 in the other direction). The particle follows Newton’s second law while
drag applies a force proportional to velocity by19 viscous damping coefficient β giving
⃗F = m⃗a = −β⃗v

Solving for how the velocity evolves over time, we see this particle slows exponentially with
a time constant (the relaxation time) τ = m

(4.12)
In the time it takes to equilibrate velocity, the particle will travel a finite maximum distance

That is, the gas will push the particle until the particle is moving at the same relative speed
as the gas, and in this time (about 3τ) the particle will move a distance S = |τ⃗v0|.

We can see that even at high 1000 m s−1 initial velocities a particle will stop and match the
gas flow movement within nanoseconds and micrometers in atmospheric pressure and can
take microseconds and move millimeters in 1 Torr vacuum. Incidentally, this is one place
where the precise vacuum pressure matters: if we want particles to travel multiple meters
against the gas flow without an additional force20, this would require a significantly lower

are close to zero compared to 760 Torr atmospheric pressure.
Let’s consider particle motion through a series of chambers and pressure gradients, which
illustrates a number of important and useful effects.
Figure 4.5: Gas (black arrows) flows into a left chamber (perhaps a nanoparticle generator),
through tubing and a narrow opening into a right (vacuum) chamber at significantly lower
pressure, and out into a pump. Nanoparticles (red circles) follow the gas as soon as they are
created but start to deviate from gas streamlines in the low-pressure vacuum chamber.
Gas flow and pressure gradient: Before considering nanoparticle motion, note how the
gas moves through this system. Gas is continually added on the left, removed from the right,
and flows as one might intuitively expect21. The two chambers are each mostly at constant
pressure, but the pressure can drop through the thin tube connecting them (in vacuum
engineering, this is quantified as the conductance22 [207]), and especially across the small
opening into the right vacuum chamber. This leaves the chambers at different pressures (gas
flow is driven by pressure gradients). We will assume gas flow is independent of particles
(which are sufficiently small and sparse).
Flow into vacuum chamber: It is worth elaborating on how the right vacuum chamber
is at low pressure at steady state even though gas is flowing into it. This is a differentially
pumped vacuum system23. Similar setups are common in semiconductor process equipment
to keep process gas at a specific pressure or in scanning electron microscope electron guns.
In mass spectrometers these move analytes from high pressure to vacuum, and the opening
is referred to as a skimmer24 [219][220][221]. The small opening can be engineered (e.g., as
an orifice plate or de Laval nozzle) to create a large pressure differential and often operates
in the choked flow regime [207].
Particle motion: Due to short relaxation times and stopping distances as in table 4.2,
particles almost exactly follow gas streamlines to move from the left chamber (where they
21A full treatment of fluid dynamics is out of scope of this dissertation.
22Conductance allows simple analysis of vacuum systems in free molecular flow. It acts similar to networks
of electrical or thermal conductivities.
23A larger differentially pumped system might have separate vacuum pumps for each chamber.
24Skimmers have variations from simple to complex. For example, an ion funnel [218] uses ponderomotive
force to guide charged particles toward an orifice, similar to the quadrupole we will investigate in chapter 6.

were perhaps created by vapor nucleation), through the tubing, and into the right. Once in
the right chamber, however, their stopping distance is long enough that they start to break
away from streamlines due to inertia; the lower the pressure the larger this effect. If they
hit a chamber wall or surface, assume they stop moving. We will want to deposit particles
on surfaces, but if any make it to the vacuum pump they can be caught by a filter.
Particles in tubing: Besides air drag, particles in flow through a narrow tube experience
three major effects: Brownian diffusion (as previously discussed), thermophoresis, and elec-
trostatic forces. Diffusion causes nanoparticles to move throughout the tube and possibly
stick to the tube sidewall [102]. Thermophoresis, the effect that gas atoms near a hot surface
have higher kinetic energy, can cause nanoparticles to move away from the tube wall if the
tube is warmer than the gas flow or toward it if cooler [222][102][126][223]. Finally, charged
particles will be attracted to electrically conductive tubing walls via image charge or possibly
to charge built up on electrically insulating tubing [224][225]. We typically want particles
to move through tubes like this without being lost by sticking to their walls, so we might
choose to use large tube diameters, maximize gas speed to minimize residence time, or heat
the tubes to induce thermophoretic force [126].
Gravity: So far we have ignored the effect of gravity on particle motion, and we can justify
continuing to do so. Equating the force from g = 9.8 m/s2 Earth gravity to air drag in
atmosphere gives a 10 nm particle a terminal velocity v = τ ·g of only 3×10−7 m s−1 compared
to the much larger25 4.6 × 10−4 m diffusion in 1 s we computed in section 4.1.1.
All that suffices to understand basic particle motion in a gas. In order to achieve our goal
of printing particles on a surface at 100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1 with sub-1 µm resolution, we’ll
need to carefully consider the motion of gas and nanoparticles through velocity-increasing
nozzles and around surfaces.
4.2.1
Nozzles and Why We Want Vacuum
Consider what is required to print particles onto a surface via aerosol manipulation. When a
gas flow is aimed at the surface, it breaks and turns to either side. If particles follow the gas
streamlines exactly, as happens at high pressures (due to low stopping distances), they will
be blown off to the side and will not reach the surface26. In order to print particles, we need
their stopping distance to be long enough that they can diverge from the gas streamlines and
instead travel straight onto the surface via inertia. This is done by making the gas pressure
above the substrate be low: a partial vacuum27.
We then need to design the gas flow to focus particles to a narrow area (our sub-1 µm reso-
lution) and high speed (we want 100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1). This is the job of a nozzle.
25This is subtly misleading because diffusion increases with square root of time, but the conclusion holds.
26Except maybe through Brownian diffusion, which is very imprecise.
27This won’t be high vacuum because we’re continually adding gas into the area.
43
Figure 4.6: In order for nanoparticles (red circles) to be printed onto a surface, they can
be accelerated and focused within a nozzle, but once exiting the nozzle they must continue
to travel straight to reach the surface despite gas streamlines (black arrows) turning to the
side, which can be achieved by making pressure P low. The distance L between nozzle and
substrate is often comparable to nozzle diameter Dnozzle. Also, Brownian diffusion causes
particles to spread out from the centerline anyway, decreasing resolution.
We can approximate what the pressure P above the surface must be even before knowing
more specifics of the gas airflow. Particles travel a distance L between nozzle and substrate,
and L must be nonzero and often greater than nozzle diameter Dnozzle so the gas has some-
where to go. Dnozzle is limited by manufacturing and flow rate concerns to be larger than
0.1 mm to 1 mm, so assume L ≥1 mm. We know the particle stopping distance S has to be
significantly larger than this, i.e., S > L (preferably S ≫L because we want particles to
have nonzero velocity upon impact). This dimensionless quantity S/L is called the Stokes
number [102]. According to table 4.2, particles above 1 µm diameter might have S > L in
760 Torr atmosphere, but below 100 nm a lower pressure closer to 1 Torr is required. This
explains the divide between cold spray and aerosol deposition we saw in chapter 3: cold spray
uses large particles so it works at atmospheric pressures, but aerosol deposition needs vac-
uum; its literature reports pressures of 0.1 Torr to 10 Torr28 [185]. Even lower pressures are
counterproductive as they require bringing the gas closer to the free molecular flow regime
even upstream of the nozzle, limiting focusing drag force and increasing diffusion.
How much particle focusing and acceleration is possible? We want high resolution (< 1 µm)
and high speeds (100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1). The literature has several nozzle geometries:
Aerosol impactors: at its most basic, a nozzle can be just a narrow cylinder through
which particles travel as in figure 4.6. Printing resolution is larger than the nozzle diameter
Dnozzle (generally > 100 µm) due to gas drag and Brownian diffusion. Velocities are limited
by choked flow to about sound speed (< 400 m s−1). This simple mechanism finds use in
the aerosol (cascade) impactors (as mentioned and used in chapter 2) that aim to efficiently
collect nanoparticles on a substrate for later analysis with no need for high resolution or veloc-
ity [102][226][227][228]. Mass spectrometer interfaces are similar sans substrate [219]. These
were briefly applied as “gas deposition”, a precursor to aerosol deposition [229][230].
Converging-diverging (de Laval) nozzles: Initial work in the 1980s [231][232][233] found
that in a converging-diverging nozzle29, nanoparticles are given inertia to move toward the
28This pressure range is why we used 760 Torr and 1 Torr as example pressures throughout this chapter.
29These de Laval nozzles are also found on rocket engines.
44
nozzle center as the gas flow through the nozzle converges, and as the flow diverges (often
at lower pressure) the drag force pulls particles away from the center. Proper nozzle design
balancing these forces with particle inertia can result in focusing particles in the gas flow
into a beam significantly more narrow (100x in theory) than the mechanical diameter of
the nozzle, so a 100 µm nozzle, about the smallest feasible to build, can print with down to
1 µm theoretical resolution (ignoring Brownian motion). These nozzles are now ubiquitous
in cold spray and aerosol deposition [234]. The gas velocity through these nozzles can be
somewhat supersonic (in practice, below about 1000 m s−1 [59]); particle impact speed is
somewhat lower than this (often < 700 m s−1) [235] after particles slow down as they cross
gas streamlines (bow shock, in supersonic nozzle flow [236][237]) between the nozzle and
substrate [238]. Also, focusing depends strongly on particle diameter [236][237][239].
Sheath gas and collimation: Modifications can be made to converging-diverging nozzles,
e.g., gas relief channels can reduce pressure for higher impact speeds [235], a stream of gas
with particles can be surrounded by a sheath gas stream and the result compacted in a nozzle
[240][239], or a collimating section can be added [241]. These latter methods can provide
additional focusing and also help increase pressure upstream of a nozzle to maintain choked
flow for high speeds. Some setups achieve experimental 10 µm to 20 µm printing resolution
(the best demonstrated with aerosols to our knowledge) and 2 µm theoretically (neglecting
Brownian motion), but with only 100 m s−1 velocity [239][241][242][240].
Aerodynamic lenses: Serially stacking converging-diverging nozzles (which can be as sim-
ple as a single orifice each) can better focus nanoparticles: this is called an aerodynamic lens
[214][243][244][245][246][247]. A calculator exists for easy design [61][248]. Though smaller
particles are harder to focus due to their lower inertia and higher diffusion, aerodynamic
lenses provide a design framework that has been used to focus particles as small as 1 nm to
10 nm [244][125], though focusing resolutions are generally > 100 µm, velocities are usually
< 100 m s−1, and many particles are lost by adhesion to the lens sides. Deposition works
[249], but the end of such a lens often opens into high vacuum to create particle beams for
mass spectrometry or spectroscopy. [214] gives an expression for particle beam broadening
due to the initial angular spread from Brownian motion when entering high vacuum.
We can see these aerosol nozzle particle focusing methods can approach the printing velocities
and resolutions we want but cannot quite reach them. They are somewhat further suboptimal
for deposition as discussed in chapter 3 for the following reasons:
• Velocity limits: gas flows are generally limited to slightly-supersonic < 1000 m s−1, and
particle speeds are somewhat slower than this. Though aerosol deposition and cold
spray reach the 100 m s−1 to 500 m s−1 minimum speeds required for deposition, the
higher velocities (3000 m s−1) we hypothesized may be useful do not seem feasible.
• Resolution limits: the highest printing resolution experimentally demonstrated to date
is only 10 µm [241] (for > 500 nm particles; smaller is harder) and it is not clear
whether better is possible. Below we give another argument that sub-1 µm resolutions
are unlikely due to Brownian diffusion.
• There is significant gas flow around the part under construction, which may damage
fragile printed objects or be affected by substrates heated for epitaxy.
45
As a final argument that further development of aerosol-based focusing is unlikely to lead
to our desired printing resolution, consider limits due to Brownian diffusion. In the setup
of figure 4.6, suppose particles are perfectly focused into a tight beam (< 10 nm diameter)
within a nozzle then leave at a maximum 1000 m s−1 and travel a minimum 1 mm distance to
the substrate (again, the surrounding gas pressure must be sufficiently low for the particle to
make it to the substrate). In the 1 µs of travel time, we can approximate how far particles can
diffuse perpendicular to their direction of travel using equation 4.8; twice this is the minimum
particle placement resolution. The printing resolution is limited both by diffusion/placement
and by particle size (1 µm particles cannot print a line < 1 µm wide).
Figure 4.7: A rough model of aerosol printing resolution limits as described above. Achieving
a given resolution (100 nm, 1 µm, 10 nm) requires both a small particle size and low Brownian
diffusion, but increasing the pressure to minimize diffusion eventually means the particle
stopping distance is too short and it never hits the substrate. There is only a small region
(shaded light gray) where 1 µm printing may be possible; 100 nm never is, and unfortunately
this requires large (> 100 nm) particles less likely to make high-quality electronic thin films.
It makes sense that the literature’s best printing resolutions are just under 10 µm.
We can conclude that aerosol nanoparticle manipulation is close but insufficient; it can nei-
ther focus nor accelerate particles as much as we would like to make interesting devices.
In order to achieve higher velocities and resolutions, we will have to consider methods not lim-
ited by Brownian diffusion, i.e., electrostatic forces in vacuum (as a limit, recall single-atom
focused beam methods can achieve sub-10 nm resolution and > 1 × 104 m s−1). It is worth
dedicating our effort (chapters 5, 6) to investigating these instead of pure aerosols.
However, aerosol manipulation is still useful. It is convenient for moving nanoparticles around
before printing (we used it already in chapter 2) and might be used for bringing nanoparticles
into vacuum in a controlled way before further electrostatic manipulation. Furthermore,
aerosol focusing will let us test multimaterial deposition albeit with low impact speeds and
bad resolution. We’ll try that now.
46
4.3
Experimental Implementation
Although aerosol deposition cannot by itself reach the full range of deposition velocities
and high resolutions we want, it can print nanoparticles with the minimum 100 m s−1 to
500 m s−1 velocity required for minimal particle-substrate adhesion and with sub-1 mm (not
sub-1 µm) resolution. We constructed such a system to demonstrate multimaterial printing
with the nanoparticle sources we built in chapter 2. Because the system includes moving
nanoparticles into a vacuum chamber, it is also an excellent starting point to build a future
electrostatic focusing and acceleration apparatus as described in chapters 5 and 6.

ticle generator. Right: second version with larger chamber and laser nanoparticle generator.
47
Safety note: vacuum chambers are generally safe except for minor implosion concerns.
Placed in standard atmosphere, a 300 mm cube vacuum chamber has a pressure differ-
ential of one atmosphere (101 kPa or 760 Torr) giving a potential energy of 2.7 kJ that
can be suddenly released. This risk is easily minimized by sufficiently robust construc-
tion. This is also significantly safer than pressure vessels (like gas cylinders or common
workshop air compressors): even the best vacuum chamber has a pressure differential
of at most one atmosphere, but pressure vessels can be pressurized to potentially tens
or hundreds of times atmospheric pressure with proportional stored energy.
We actually made two iterations of the same system. The first was built around the spark
ablation nanoparticle generator from chapter 2. This system was replaced with the second
which instead used the the laser ablation nanoparticle generator and also added a larger,
higher-quality vacuum chamber. The systems otherwise worked similarly.
Both systems were constructed with a vacuum chamber as required for printing nanoparticles
(see section 4.2.1). The first system used a custom30 cylindrical chamber (220 mm diameter
by 270 mm tall); the second had a commercially-built31 high-vacuum-capable chamber with
a 300 mm cubical interior. Both were pumped with an 160 L min−1 Edwards RV8 rotary
vane vacuum pump and monitored by an Edwards APG-M-NW16 Pirani vacuum gauge.
The chambers could both reach a base pressure of under 5 × 10−2 Torr within a couple
minutes as expected. Progressively lower vacuum levels need progressively better hardware
(see [207]). In our case, we needed only 1 Torr pressure, well within the low vacuum range
that only requires a single pumping stage, and only used air (any semiconductor process
gas, for example, would need much more attention paid to safe usage, venting, and exhaust).
This meant we were able to take shortcuts for the first chamber: wire feedthroughs were
custom made with laser-cut acrylic32 bolted with o-rings to the aluminum baseplate, for
example. The second chamber was made with significantly more care including CF flanges
and commercial electrical feedthroughs and should be capable of reaching high vacuum
(< 1 × 10−5 Torr) if a second pumping stage (e.g., turbopump) were later added.
After leaving the nanoparticle generators, aerosols were moved through standard 1/4 inch
(4.6 mm ID) stainless steel instrumentation tubing connected with compression and VCR
face seal fittings, eventually reaching the nozzle, a 20 mm long 0.21 mm ID (27 gauge) steel
dispensing needle inside the vacuum chamber positioned 1 mm to 3 mm from the substrate.
Total flow distance from the nanoparticle generator to nozzle was 380 mm or 800 mm for the
two system versions, respectively. During operation, an input gas valve was adjusted to allow
about 0.5 standard liter per minute gas flow (air) through the nanoparticle generators to
each chamber. When entering the vacuum chamber through the nozzle and with our vacuum
pump, this gas flow resulted in steady state chamber pressures of 0.5 Torr to 1 Torr. Based on
the choked flow assumption and similarity to mass spectrometer inlet capillaries [219][220],
we estimate nozzle gas (and particle) exit velocities were 100 m s−1 to 350 m s−1.

webcam, and light. Center: custom XY stage. Right: inside of second version while printing
the gold line from section 4.3.3 on an alumina substrate clamped to the XY stage.
Besides the large vacuum chambers, the largest addition to these systems beyond the basic
impaction setup we used in chapter 2 was a motorized XY stage able to move the substrate
(clamped on top of the stage) with respect to the nozzle in order to print 2D patterns. It is
preferable to move the small and light substrate while keeping the nozzle, which is connected
to rigid tubing, fixed in place33. Small vacuum-compatible XY stages with nanometer pre-
cision are commercially available34. We built our own stage from stepper motor linear slide
modules, open loop stepper motor drivers, and open source 3D printer control software. This
XY stage could move about 40 by 40 mm with estimated 10 µm repeatability. Besides the
stage, we also added a USB webcam camera and LED light inside the vacuum chambers to
observe the printing process. None of the XY stage, webcam, or light needed special care to
survive the vacuum35.
Figure 4.10: Left: BSAC logo in copper on paper, printed in 45 min. Right: the printing
process at (a) 0 min, (b) 15 min, (c) 30 min, (d) 45 min.
33The electrostatic focusing system of chapter 6 replaces the nozzle and is larger and heavier. But then,
given charged particles, we might additionally deflect particles electrostatically in XY (like scanning electron
microscopy) for fast small motion. A mechanical XY stage is still necessary for long-distance movement.
34Piezo motor or voice coil stages with optical feedback are >$5k from [250][251][252].
35This worked because (a) we used no harmful process gases and (b) we did not need high vacuum which
offgassing or virtual leaks from these parts might prohibit. We also found no heat dissipation problems.
49
As an initial test, we printed the logo of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC)
with copper nanoparticles on paper. Using the deposition conditions outlined above with the
spark ablation nanoparticle generator and moving the XY stage created the successful result
shown in figure 4.10. The stage was moved at 0.1 mm s−1 below the nozzle; at this speed,
the total print took 45 min to complete. This could be sped up significantly by increasing
the nanoparticle flow rate or printing thinner lines. The printed lines had a dense inner
portion about 160 µm wide and a fainter 400 µm outer portion, respectively thinner and
thicker than the 0.21 mm nozzle. Nanoparticles were continually generated, so in order to
print disconnected patterns (the “B” and rectangular border, for example), the stage was
moved at a faster 1 mm s−1 between these thereby creating only faint (diagonal) lines36.
It is interesting to note standard microfabrication cannot replicate this. Specifically, micro-
fabrication cannot deposit a metal shape on paper substrates37 because the paper would not
survive the wet chemical photoresist developing and removal steps required to pattern the
metal, not to mention whatever process is used for etching.
4.3.1
Multimaterial Printing
As emphasized in chapter 1, semiconductor devices are made of multiple electronics-grade
materials, and one of the most interesting possibilities of a nanoparticle printer is the ability
to pattern multiple such materials in a single tool.
We already demonstrated generation of nanoparticles from 8 different materials and printing
on glass, steel, and silicon in chapter 2. We have also printed copper on paper. What remains
to be shown is that multiple materials can be added to the same part38.
To prove this is possible, we printed lines of copper, silver, gold, and silicon (in that order)
on an alumina substrate. Specifically, we began with a 25 mm diameter alumina disk (96%
Al2O3, remainder SiO2) then deposited one material at a time, moving the substrate at
0.1 mm s−1 for 2.5 min each with the same parameters used previously, to create 15 mm long
lines. After each line, the laser nanoparticle generator was stopped, opened, and had its
material target changed out, all while the substrate remained at vacuum.
The successful result is shown in figure 4.11. All lines were about 500 µm wide; more detailed
geometry measurements are shown in section 4.3.2.
This is significantly wider than the
0.21 mm nozzle. Interestingly, each material demonstrated subtly different behavior despite
being deposited in the exact same conditions (including laser nanoparticle parameters, gas
flow rate, and print speeds). Copper and silver stuck to the substrate and printed well-
defined clean lines. The gold adhered to both itself and copper and silver lines beneath but
not to the substrate, resulting in a film that flaked off (especially when blown away by gas
escaping the nozzle). As briefly noted in chapter 2, the poor adhesion of gold to alumina is
due to its inability to oxidize. This is a known effect in microfabrication solved by depositing
gold films instead on an intermediate Cr or Ti film as an adhesion layer. The printed silicon,
finally, produced a thin yet tall ridge (see section 4.3.2).
36In future work this could be replaced with a proper beam blanking mechanism.
37Except maybe with a shadow mask, which has other drawbacks. See elaboration on this in section 4.3.1.
38Given a functional printer this might seem trivial. It somewhat is—that’s why printers are interesting.
50
Figure 4.11: Left: copper, silver, gold, and silicon lines printed (in that order) on an alumina
disk. Right: clockwise from top left, the intersection of Cu/Au, Cu/Si, Ag/Si, and Ag/Au.
Despite this result, more work remains to produce a working multimaterial semiconductor
device (for example, a diode); we have yet to reliably print even simple conductors besides
gold. We believe this is solvable: we discuss the major roadblock, oxidation, in section 4.3.3.
The other problem is low film quality: as hypothesized in section 4.3.2, these lines are porous
with sub-bulk qualities. The way to fix that (see chapter 3) is to print with higher particle
impact velocities using something better than aerosol deposition.
But we have still shown another feat microfabrication cannot replicate: this simple pattern
was printed in 10 min, but it would have taken microfabrication many hours to make this
because each different material requires its own deposition, lithography, and etch steps.
For completeness, there is one microfabrication technique that can achieve similar results:
stencil lithography [253][254], where a thin membrane with holes (a shadow mask) is placed
in between an evaporator material source and a substrate in high vacuum39. The mask can be
moved to change where material is deposited [255]; switching materials allows multimaterial
deposition. Sub-100 nm patterning has been achieved. However, deposition rates are slow
(1 nm s−1), so patterning large arbitrary custom structures takes unreasonably long, and the
stencil can become clogged over time. As a result, this is used only for occasional nanoscale
research tasks. Nanoparticle printing, though it has yet to achieve the same printing resolu-
tions, has neither of these limits and should be better suited to general applications.
39This can be modeled as apertures subject to the emittance theorem (see chapter 6).
51
4.3.2
3D Printing
Up until now, we have only discussed printing in 2D40. Theoretically a nanoparticle printer
can easily extend this to 3D: simply print multiple 2D patterns on top of one another41.
Doing this requires each layer to be thick but might allow printing MEMS.
We can get some preliminary evidence that printing thick layers is possible. We used a 3D
laser confocal microscope to measure the cross-section of the Cu, Ag, Au, and Si lines we
printed in section 4.3.1 with results shown in figure 4.12. These lines were about 500 µm
wide and 10 µm tall with the exception of silicon that formed a 50 µm high peak.
We can also use these cross-sections to estimate the volume of the printed lines and, from
there, the rate at which material was deposited. The volumes of these 15 mm long lines
are, for Cu, Ag, Au, and Si, 0.033 mm3, 0.039 mm3, 0.053 mm3, and 0.095 mm3.
Since
each was printed in 150 s, this gives possibly unrealistically high mass deposition rates of
7.1 mg h−1, 9.9 mg h−1, 25 mg h−1, and 5.3 mg h−1.
In chapter 2, we estimated the laser
ablation nanoparticle generation rate at only 0.6 mg h−1 to 6 mg h−1. We can conclude that
a large fraction of material was successfully transferred as nanoparticles from material target
to substrate (i.e., high efficiency) and these lines are probably porous with lower density than
bulk, as expected from low particle impact velocities (see chapter 3).
Figure 4.12: Left: height profiles of the lines printed in figure 4.11 showing 3D geometry.
Right: a 3D conical silicon deposit in midair stuck to tweezers.
These deposits may be thick enough for 3D printing, but we can do better: focusing the
same nanoparticles to a smaller area (and with higher impact velocities) as we eventually
hope to do should produce thinner yet taller lines. It might also improve the rough surface
(which is likely due in part to forces from impacting gas).
Also, in a separate experiment while printing silicon on glass, we noticed a large silicon
deposit detached from its glass substrate (see figure 4.12). It stuck to a pair of tweezers used
to pick it up, technically becoming a freestanding structure. This supports the hypothesis
that nanoparticle-printed structures are sufficiently solid to form 3D shapes.
40Aside from mentions of aerosol 3D printing in chapter 1, which remain promising.
41Overhanging geometry can be made by printing then later etching away a sacrificial support material.
52
4.3.3
Conductors and Oxidation Problems
We can print multiple materials, but we should also show they still exhibit the electrical
behavior necessary to make semiconductor devices. A good first step is confirming expected
conductors (and semiconductors) are electrically conductive and insulators are not.
We confirmed printed gold is conductive. We deposited another 15 mm gold line on alumina
(an insulator) with the same parameters as in section 4.3.1. As previously noted, the gold
formed a solid film that flaked off due to poor adhesion to the alumina substrate, but it
was still sufficiently solid to confirm conductivity. On a probe station, we positioned two
micromanipulator probes about 100 µm apart atop one gold flake and measured a resistance
of about 4 Ωfluctuating slightly with time (and removing the probes left visible scratches).
This is conductive; we attribute the somewhat high42 resistance and fluctuations to the
hypothesized porous structure and resulting minor local joule heating. This should be fixed
by creating a more solid film by increasing particle impact velocity as in chapter 3.
Figure 4.13: Left: gold line printed on alumina. Center: gold flakes off substrate. Right top:
two probe tips on edge of gold line. Right bottom: visible scratches with probes removed.
However, repeating this with copper gave no measurable conductivity. It seems metals (and
Si) other than gold are not conductive when they should be. This is problematic.
The problem is almost certainly oxidation: oxygen molecules that hit a surface will often
react with the exposed atoms43 to form an oxide that happens to be an electrical insulator.
Copper becomes44 CuO or Cu2O, aluminum becomes Al2O3, silicon becomes45 SiO2. The
gas flowing through our system was air, which contains much more than enough oxygen to
oxidize the surface of nanoparticles nearly as soon as they are created, so the final printed
material might be mostly insulating oxides with, at best, small isolated pockets of conductive
metal that were incompletely oxidized. Gold is the exception as it is the only metal without
a thermodynamically stable oxide. Oxidation is why welding needs inert gas, soldering needs
flux, and why iron rusts46. The oxidation hypothesis is further supported by our EDS image
of printed copper in chapter 2 which found significant oxygen.
42A solid 100 by 100 by 5 µm gold film should have 0.0049 Ωresistance.
43Sometimes oxygen can also diffuse through a material to oxidize more atoms underneath.
44Copper oxides are P-type semiconductors, but it is hard for us to take advantage of that right now.
45This is useful in microfabrication to purposely grow thin films of SiO2 on silicon [1].
46Rust is just iron’s oxide, but it happens to expand and become mechanically unstable when grown.
53
In other words: if our experiments were repeated but all oxygen were magically removed
from the surrounding air, everything would still work and our printed copper, silver, and
other metals would be conductive, and the silicon would likely be properly semiconducting.
If not for oxygen, we might have printed diodes and transistors by now.
The best solution47 to the oxidation problem is exactly this: to remove oxygen (and water
vapor, which contains oxygen and can act similarly) from the chamber. Perfect removal is
near-impossible, so we should ask exactly how much oxygen our process can tolerate.
We would like nanoparticles to remain (at least mostly) oxide free from their creation until
they are printed48 and covered with another layer of particles. Suppose this takes several
seconds.
Using equation 4.3 we can calculate it takes about 1 s for oxygen at a partial
pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr to completely cover a surface; this is a good minimum pressure
target to aim for though lower is of course preferable.
Reaching oxygen pressures below 1×10−6 Torr is well within vacuum technology capabilities
and is commonly used in microfabrication evaporation for this same reason [118]. This falls
within the high vacuum regime (8 × 10−5 Torr to 8 × 10−9 Torr [207]); the typical approach
is to bring a sufficiently good vacuum chamber down to a full vacuum (no gases including
oxygen) then optionally backfill it with some other non-oxygen gas if desired (as used in
sputtering [118]). What makes things a little more difficult is we need near-atmospheric
pressure for the nanoparticle generators; those sections of our system need gas with part-
per-billion oxygen levels. Argon is sold with part-per-million oxygen impurities but can be
further filtered before flowing into a gas chamber to reach these low levels [58]. All this
does require significant attention paid to chamber materials, cleanliness, and vacuum pump
stages, but it may be worthwhile: another benefit of high vacuum is a large gas mean free
path with negligible Brownian motion, and we may be able to take advantage of this to
achieve high precision as discussed in chapter 6.
It is also useful to monitor oxygen and water vapor levels to confirm the desired low oxygen
pressures are reached. Monitoring methods include [257] electrochemical sensors, optical
sensing (spectrometry) [149], and residual gas analyzers [207].
Unfortunately we were unable to obtain a sufficiently good vacuum system within the time
and budget constraints for this dissertation49, so we will have to postpone printing non-gold
conductors and semiconductors to future work.
However: we can still conclude multimaterial nanoparticle printing, the first half of what we
need to create a better device fabrication technology, seems feasible. Since were not able
to reach the second half—high particle resolutions and impact velocities—with aerosols, as
proposed in 3 we will now consider electrostatic manipulation of nanoparticles to further
refine their movement.
47An alternative solution is to make the gas actively reducing (often “forming gas”, a 5% H / 95% N2
mixture) to counteract oxide growth, but this might create other problems.
48Interestingly, the impact and deformation of the larger particles of cold spray can break through their
surface oxide coating, allowing printing metals in atmosphere. This doesn’t work on our smaller scales [256].
49We did briefly try using 1ppm nitrogen gas flow instead of air, but we saw no benefit as expected as the
resulting 1 × 10−3 Torr oxygen partial pressure in the nanoparticle generator remained too high.

Chapter 5
Nanoparticle Charging
So far we have created nanoparticles, moved them in a low-pressure gas, and achieved
some limited multimaterial printing success, but also found we need additional control over
nanoparticle motion if we want to print truly small or high-quality structures. That control
will come from electrostatic manipulation in chapter 6, but in order to move nanoparticles
with electric fields, we must first electrically charge the nanoparticles.
That is, we must somehow add or remove electrons from each nanoparticle without affecting
the positively-charged atomic nuclei thus leaving the particle with a negative or positive
charge, respectively—and we need to do this while the particles remain suspended in midair
to avoid compromising their material purity. This is nontrivial.
5.1
Charging Methods
Fortunately for us, plenty of nanoparticle charging prior art exists in the academic literature.
Aerosol studies often charge nano- to micron-scale particles as the first step in measuring,
collecting, or otherwise manipulating them. Charging (albeit for single atoms and molecules)
is also fundamental to mass spectrometry, focused ion beam tools, and trapped-ion quantum
computing. Charging methods include (but are not limited to) [102][76]:
• Diffusion charging: Suppose particles are in a gas and some gas molecules are ion-
ized (unipolar, i.e., either positive or negative, not both). When an ionized molecule
collides with a particle via Brownian motion, an electric charge is sometimes trans-
ferred. Repeated collisions can build up a large charge. If the gas has both positive
and negative ions (a bipolar distribution), this can instead discharge.
• Field charging: This is diffusion charging in the presence of a uniform electric field,
which more efficiently charges larger particles due to electric field distortions around
the particles. Diffusion and field charging are often combined.
• Corona, flame, radioactive, and photoelectric charging: These are all methods
to charge the gases that then charge particles via diffusion and field charging. Corona
55
charging uses high voltage breakdown of the gas, flame charging uses thermionic emis-
sion via the high temperature of a flame, radioactive charging uses an α or β source,
and photoelectric charging uses the photoelectric effect.
• Photoelectric charging: Photoelectric charging can directly charge nanoparticles
without diffusion or field charging as an intermediary [258].
Photons of sufficient
energy (often UV or x-ray) hit a surface, are absorbed by electrons, and give them
sufficient kinetic energy to leave the particle. This is the dominant mechanism for
charging dust around a star or in the interstellar medium [259].
• Electron impact ionization: Bombarding nanoparticles with electrons can give them
a negative charge or, via secondary electron emission, a positive charge [260][261]. Used
in mass spectrometry for charging molecules; has been used for cluster beam deposition
[178][47]. Requires high vacuum for the electron mean free path to be sufficiently long.
Important in lunar dust behavior along with photoelectric charging [262].
• Electrospray ionization: A way to simultaneously generate and charge nanopar-
ticles using a liquid medium (see also its description in chapter 2). Used as a mass
spectrometry ion source or a liquid metal ion source (LMIS) for focused ion beam tools
[76][108][109]. It is possible to charge nanoparticles [112], but we will ignore this as
the process is messy, material-dependent, and might compromise material purity.
• Field and thermionic emission: More a fundamental physical effect than a charging
method. Electrons are pulled from a material surface with a sufficiently strong electric
field (field emission) or break away with sufficiently high kinetic energy from high
temperature (thermionic emission). Commonly used for, e.g., electron microscopes.
Is used for electron impact ionization. Sometimes flame charging makes nanoparticles
emit electrons via thermionic emission in addition to field and diffusion charging. Field
emission is also responsible for charging limits as described later.
• Spark ablation: The same spark ablation process used to generate nanoparticles can
also allow some to end up with a charge due to the large ion concentration in the
spark arc, not dissimilar from corona charging. The resulting nanoparticles have a
distribution of positive, negative, and neutral charges [128].
All these methods have different capabilities. They result in different charge distributions
(some percentage of nanoparticles are positively charged, neutral, and negative) and have
different efficacies on nanoparticles of different diameters (e.g., field charging is more effective
for larger particles). Many nanoparticle charging applications, such as mass spectrometry or
the differential mobility analyzer (DMA) previously mentioned as a way to sort nanoparticle
diameters, prefer methods that more reliably give a single electrical charge to all sizes of
nanoparticles. This makes it easy to sort nanoparticles based on mass-to-charge ratio.
What qualities do we want from a charging method? As we will see later, we prefer nanopar-
ticles to have as high a charge as possible, and we would also like to ensure all nanoparticles
(instead of only a small fraction) are charged. To choose a method, we should first discuss
maximum charge limits.
56
5.1.1
Charging Limits
There is a limit to how much charge can be put on a nanoparticle. If the negative charge
is increased by adding electrons, the nanoparticle can have such a negative charge that any
additional added electrons are spontaneously repelled. Likewise, if electrons are removed to
leave a positive charge, there is a point at which repulsion between the positively charged
nuclei is sufficient to break up the nanoparticle. This limit can be approximated [102] by
comparing the surface electric field strength Es needed to remove an electron (i.e., field
emission) or nucleus to the field present on the surface of a charged particle of diameter dp
from Gauss’s law Es = (ne)/(πϵ0d2
p), where n is the number of elementary charges on the
particle, e ≈1.60 × 10−19 C is the elementary charge, and ϵ0 ≈8.85 × 10−12 F m−1 is the
permittivity of vacuum. This maximum number of charges n is
n ≤πϵ0Esd2
p
e
.
(5.1)
The precise value of Es, often modeled with Fowler-Nordheim theory, is heavily dependent
on the surface.
For a rough estimate, Hinds [102] suggests Es ≈9.0 × 108 V m−1 and
Es ≈2.1 × 1010 V m−1 for electron and nucleus emission, respectively.
There are limits for the diffusion and field charging methods mentioned above: a charged
nanoparticle will electrostatically repel similarly charged gas molecules, reducing the likeli-
hood of further charging[102]. All these charge limits can be quantitatively graphed:
Figure 5.1: The limits to nanoparticle charging, from [102]. Above the positive ion limit,
removing additional electrons will cause a nanoparticle to break apart via repulsion between
positive nuclei; above the electron limit, adding more electrons is impossible as any new
electrons are spontaneously repelled due to excess negative charge. The Rayleigh limit is the
point at which liquid droplets break up overcoming surface tension. Contrast these with the
much lower maximum charging limits achieved by field and diffusion charging or the average
charge achieved in standard atmosphere due to background radiation.
57
For our desired nanoparticle diameters of approximately 5 to 50 nm, we see that positive
charge is limited to hundreds of unit charges and negative charge sometimes to the low tens:
if we positively charge nanoparticles, we can fit a higher net charge. But also note that
field and diffusion charging may struggle to add even a single charge to a sufficiently small
nanoparticle, far from the theoretical maximum.
The best nanoparticle charging method for us is likely photoelectric charging. It is theoret-
ically able to charge particles to their maximum limits, unlike diffusion and field charging,
and is much more capable at charging sub-100 nm diameter nanoparticles. It also results in
a positive charge which has a higher maximum charge limit than negative charging, giving
an advantage over electron impact ionization. Finally, it may be the simplest to implement
in whatever printing system we build because it depends little on the nanoparticle material,
gas, or ambient electric field: arbitrarily high photon densities have negligible effect on elec-
trostatic nanoparticle movement, unlike the high densities of gas ions or electron densities
needed for other charging methods.
5.2
Photoelectric Charging
How does photoelectric charging work, in detail, and how do we implement it? The funda-
mental idea is the photoelectric effect: when a photon arrives at the surface of a material, it
can be absorbed by an electron which converts that photon into energy (kinetic and poten-
tial). If this step change in energy is sufficiently high, the electron might escape the surface
of the material. Famously1, this requires each individual photon to have sufficient energy2.
Increasing the number of photons (the intensity) will not affect the photoelectric effect; it
will merely be able to move more electrons at the same time.
Simply put: if we shine light of sufficiently high energy (low wavelength) photons at nanopar-
ticles, electrons should jump off, leaving the nanoparticle positively charged.
How much energy does it take to remove an electron from a nanoparticle? First consider some
edge cases. The energy required to remove an electron from a (neutral) atom is customarily
termed the ionization energy, while the energy to remove an electron from an infinitely large
surface of some material is called the work function Φ. The ionization energy is typically
higher than the work function. The energy required to remove an electron from a (neutral)
nanoparticle of intermediate diameter is somewhere between these. Furthermore, as soon as
one electron is removed from a nanoparticle, the particle will have a positive charge, making
it more difficult to remove the next electron, and so on.
This energy can be approximated in the same way as we previously computed the maximum
charge limit in equation 5.1, but more care is required to match empirical data [264][265].
Specifically, the energy is well-modeled by the bulk work function, plus the energy required
to move an electron from a spherical particle with a given charge, plus a correction to the
original work function due to image forces on a sphere instead of a plane. This energy to
remove the nth electron from an initially neutral nanoparticle of diameter dp is:
1This won Einstein the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.
2Usually. Sometimes lower-energy photons can combine to ionize material (multiphoton ionization) [263].

Table 5.1: The additional energy (measured in eV) beyond the work function Φ required to
remove the nth electron from a spherical particle of the given diameter according to equation
5.2. Sufficiently small particles have a maximum charge as previously noted with equation
5.1. The rightmost column labelled “∞” shows the limit as the particle diameter approaches
infinity, i.e., it becomes the infinite surface used to define the work function, and is zero by
definition. As an example of using this table, a 10 nm diameter nanoparticle of work function
5 eV would require photons of at least 5 + 0.40 = 5.4 eV to reach a charge of +2.

materials [103]. Work functions vary with crystal orientation; average values are used here.
Note that ionization energy is not defined for compound materials such as SiO2.
59
Work functions themselves are material-dependent and typically determined empirically.
Some are listed in table 5.2 for reference along with ionization energies.
For any given material, we can condense the information from equations 5.1 and 5.2 and
table 5.2 into a single graph as shown in the figure below for copper. This sort of plot makes
it clear that charging will be most reliable with photon energies significantly higher than the
work function, perhaps around 10 eV.
Figure 5.2: A graph of the energy required to positively charge a copper nanoparticle vs. its
diameter, created from equations 5.1 and 5.2 and table 5.2. We see that smaller particles
require more energy to reach a given charge and also have a lower maximum charge limit
(above which a particle will break apart). The first three ionization energies of a single
copper atom are shown on the left for comparison. The regime between the single atom
and our models is not entirely empty but is complex due to quantum effects; atomic cluster
studies report that energies fluctuate with single digit numbers of atoms [142][266][170].
5.2.1
Photoelectric Quantum Yield
There is another relevant factor we have not yet considered: how many photons are required
to charge a nanoparticle?
We can assume each photon results in at most one emitted
electron (so a +10 charge requires at least ten photons), but not all photons impacting a
surface succeed. The fraction of photons that successfully remove an electron is called the
photoelectric quantum yield, and this also varies with nanoparticle diameter—fortunately in
our favor, in that smaller nanoparticles are easier to charge [259][267][265]. The photoelectric
quantum yield is another complex material-dependent property, but approximate typical
values might be [259] on the order of 0.5 for 1 nm diameter nanoparticles (i.e., 50% of
photons result in an emitted electron), 0.1 for 10 nm, and 0.01 in diameters above 100 nm,
though efficiencies can easily be lower, e.g., 0.001 is not uncommon. Higher energy photons
tend to give higher yields, which suggests it may be more efficient to choose photons with
energies above the minimums previously calculated.
60
5.3
Photoelectric Engineering Considerations
We now know the minimum photon energy required to charge our nanoparticles. From figure
5.2, we want 5 eV to 20 eV, where the higher end of the range is preferable to reach higher
charge and increase quantum yield. How can we build a charging system out of this?
5.3.1
Light Sources
The first step in nanoparticle photoelectric charging is to generate the light used to do so.
Light is more commonly classified by wavelength than energy per photon, so recall that a
photon of a particular wavelength has a fixed energy given by the relation
E = hc
λ
(5.3)
where E is the photon energy, h = 4.14 × 10−15 eV s is Planck’s constant, c = 3.0 × 108 m s−1
is the speed of light, and λ is the photon wavelength.
Our desired 5 eV to 20 eV light
sources have wavelengths 248 nm to 62 nm (with lower wavelengths preferred). Visible light
is 400 nm to 700 nm; we are well past this into ultraviolet (UV) light. UV is often divided
into the approximate categories [268] UVA (400 nm to 315 nm), UVB (315 nm to 280 nm),
UVC (280 nm to 200 nm), and vacuum UV (VUV) (200 nm to 10 nm)3 [269].

3This includes the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range in 13.5 nm EUV lithography. Other common pho-
tolithography wavelengths are 365 nm (mercury lamps), 248 nm, and 193 nm (KrF and ArF excimer lasers).
61
There are limited known good ways to generate UV light in the range we want, and many
are fixed to certain UV wavelengths; some are shown in table 5.3. An additional difficulty
(and the reason the vacuum UV range is so-called) is that below 100 nm wavelengths (above
10 eV) there is no solid material transparent to these wavelengths that can be used as a
window, so lower wavelengths must both be generated and used within vacuum chambers4
[270]. Specifically, the best SiO2 glass (crystalline quartz) is transparent down to at most
142 nm; materials such as LiF and MgF2 reach 100 nm to 110 nm [271].
Gas-based lamps are the most common of UV light sources [269]. In gas discharge lamps
(also called arc lamps), a low-pressure gas is electrically ionized into a plasma that emits
a gas-dependent spectrum of light. This includes mercury arc lamps, the most historically
prevalent UV source, which has a spectrum including peaks at (among others) 365 nm,
254 nm, and 185 nm. Also notable are H and He lamps. He gas discharge lamps are used for
UV photoelectron spectroscopy [272]; broad-spectrum deuterium arc lamps for UV-vis spec-
troscopy. The 13.5 nm source for EUV lithography is made with a tin plasma gas [273]. An
improvement over gas discharge lamps are excimer lamps [274][275], which drive particular
gases in particular excitation states to produce mostly monochromatic light [276]. Excimer
lamps are mechanically simple and robust [277]. Particularly common are Xe2 excimer lamps
at 172 nm that balance low wavelength with the ability to use cheap glass windows.
Excimer lasers output in the UV range [273]. These use similar principles to gas lamps
with high power focused output at the cost of complexity and efficiency. They are available
in (mostly) fixed wavelengths, the most common of which are the 248 nm KrF and 193 nm
ArF lasers used for photolithography, pulsed laser deposition [146], and medical purposes.
It is also possible to use nonlinear optics to convert frequencies of other lasers to UV, e.g.,
to generate 118 nm from tripling the 355 nm third harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser [278].
LEDs are solid state and can be made to emit UV light [279][280][268]. These are currently
popular for UV curing, sterilization, gas analysis, and more in the UVA–UVC range. How-
ever, current UV LEDs are limited (and an active research area): efficiency drops with lower
wavelength, and the current lowest wavelength research LEDs are about 230 nm. 235 nm is
commercially available [281]. These are not suitable for our wavelength requirements.
Synchrotron light sources achieve high energies (e.g., 5 eV to 30 eV or 40 nm to 250 nm)
within a tunable precise wavelength band (millielectronvolts) [270][282][283]. Photon inten-
sities are much higher than what can be achieved by filtering a broad-spectrum gas UV lamp
to that wavelength band but total power is somewhat low in absolute terms. These are useful
for photoionization and photodissociation chemical studies but are large and expensive. We
do not need their wavelength resolution or tunability.
Of all these methods, gas-based excimer lamps may be our best option: they combine high
energy (low wavelength), high output, high efficiency (both in light generation and in that
their spectrum is narrow), simplicity, and relatively low cost. The 172 nm wavelength seems
particularly promising except for its somewhat low 7.21 eV energy, which would limit us to
single-digit charges for particles below 10 nm according to figure 5.2.
4Fortunately, we happen to be moving nanoparticles specifically within a vacuum chamber.
62
5.3.2
Light Intensity
We now know what wavelengths of light will work, but how much of it do we need? To reach
a charge of n, each nanoparticle will need to be hit by at least n photons but needs more if
the photoelectric quantum yield ϕ, the fraction of photons that result in an emitted electron,
is low. With ϕ = 0.1, a nanoparticle charge of +10 would require 100 photons. Also note
that, as will be discussed later with ion optics, we want nanoparticle charge to be as high as
possible and some variation in the number of charges per particle is acceptable.
Suppose nanoparticles of diameter dp move at velocity v across an distance of length L over
which UV light of sufficiently low wavelength shines at some irradiance (photons per area)
Je, some fraction of which ϕ are absorbed and result in an electron emission.
Figure 5.3: Nanoparticles of diameter dp moving at velocity v through a region of length L
into which UV light shines at intensity Je.
Then the resulting positive charge n of each particle is approximately
n = πd2
pLϕJe
4v
.
(5.4)
If we want a charge n ≥10 with dp = 10 nm, L = 100 mm, ϕ = 0.1, and v = 100 m s−1, we find
Je = 1.27×1021 photons/m2s. At a wavelength of 172 nm, Je = 1470 W/m2 = 147 mW/cm2.
This is somewhat high but feasible to achieve, especially over a small area. 172 nm Xe2
excimer lamps are commercially available with irradiance above 100 mW/cm2 (before focus-
ing) [277][284]. Recent promising work in microfabricated flat microcavity plasma lamps can
achieve higher intensities in smaller form factors with over 20% efficiency [285].
5.3.3
Charge Loss Mechanisms
Once nanoparticles are charged, there are several ways they might become discharged or lost
that we should be aware of. First, as discussed in 4, charged particles moving in gas through
narrow tubing have a greater attraction to its sidewalls (where they can stick and thus be lost)
via image charges or adsorbed charges. Second, field and diffusion charging mechanisms can
also discharge particles by transferring their charge to gas (in our case, by electrons moving
from gas atoms to nanoparticles when they collide) [286][287]. Finally, a related effect is
that sufficiently high-energy UV light [288] or electrons [289] can be absorbed by and ionize
gas atoms instead of nanoparticles (the first ionization energies of Ar and N2 are 15.8 eV and
15.6 eV [103]; interestingly, Ar– is unstable—its electron affinity is negative).
63
5.4
Experimental Tests
We now know roughly how to charge nanoparticles in theory: shine a sufficiently strong
UV lamp at them. Furthermore, the literature confirms this works experimentally: many
groups have successfully built similar nanoparticle photoelectric chargers for studying com-
mon aerosols [286][258][290], fundamental nanoparticle photoemission tests [291][267], and
mass spectrometry ion sources [292][293].
We attempted to build our own photoelectric nanoparticle charger. Unfortunately we were
unsuccessful, but we ran several partial experiments with useful lessons that can be applied
in future work. Building a charger continues to seem feasible.
Safety note: UV light is invisible and harmful to humans, capable of causing eye dam-
age and long-term skin cancer (though diffuse UV lamps are less dangerous than a laser,
which concentrates power). There is some evidence the human maximum permissible
exposure limit to 200 nm to 222 nm light might be larger than at longer UV wavelengths
[294], but for safety we considered the worst-case UV scenario. The UV lamp was oper-
ated away from skin, usually in a closed container, and while also wearing UV-blocking
safety glasses (ThorLabs LG10, which also block 1064 nm laser light in chapter 2).
Figure 5.4: Left: UV lamp, operating (imaged safely with a camera). Although its 222 nm
light is invisible, its output spectrum also contains some visible violet light. Right: the
important optical components inside the lamp (its original control board excluded). The
drive circuit converts low voltage DC to high voltage to drive the lamp bulb, whose output
is partially reflected out of the lamp with a mirror then filtered to block UV above 230 nm.
The most important part of a photoelectric nanoparticle charger is its UV lamp. Although
we predicted good results with a 172 nm lamp with over 100 mW/cm2 power and noted in
section 5.3.2 that these capabilities are commercially available, the best UV source we were
able to obtain5 was a $100 222 nm KrCl excimer lamp [295] meant for disinfection purposes
with a reported UV optical power output of 0.12 mW/cm2 (with 90% of this between 214 nm
to 226 nm) at a 5 cm distance from the lamp (or 0.0107 mW/cm2 at 20 cm). We confirmed
5This lamp was affordable compared to other sub-230 nm lamps, well-constructed, and easy to work with.
64
these specifications by measuring current generated in a UV photodiode (SD008-2171-112,
Advanced Photonix) sensitive to 220 nm to 280 nm with a 0.019 A W−1 response at 222 nm
and a 0.076 mm2 active area. Placing the diode 5 cm from the lamp generated 15 nA from
which we calculated an intensity of 1.04 mW/cm2, about 10x higher than specified (this error
is likely due to our poor-quality uncalibrated measurement setup, but, if correct, the higher
intensity would be helpful for our purposes).
We will conclude the lamp outputs about
1 × 1018 photons/m2s to 1 × 1019 photons/m2s at 5 cm.
To demonstrate nanoparticle charging, we chose to take our existing aerosol deposition
setup from chapter 4 and, between generating nanoparticles and impacting them, charge
the nanoparticles by flowing them through a 7 mm ID UV-transparent glass tube (quartz;
we measured over 50% transmittance at 222 nm via photodiode) while irradiating them with
our UV lamp. This general strategy appears to work in the photoelectric nanoparticle charger
literature [258]. To detect nanoparticle charge, we deposited the nanoparticles onto an elec-
trically isolated but conductive steel substrate attached to a Keithley 487 picoammeter (i.e.,
we built a Faraday cup).
Figure 5.5: Top: cartoon of charging experimental setup built into chapter 4 apparatus.
Nanoparticles are charged by UV light then deposited onto a conductive substrate where their
charge creates a current detected by a picoammeter. Bottom: pictures of implementation.
The UV lamp was covered for safety (not shown) while in operation.
Although this setup was crude, we calculated it might work. According to tables 5.1 and 5.2,
222 nm light (5.58 eV) should charge 10 nm copper particles up to +3. The nanoparticles
travel 80 mm through UV light of our calculated lamp intensity (1 × 1018 photons/m2s to
1 × 1019 photons/m2s).
Nanoparticle velocity was determined by gas flow speed, which,
assuming the flow conditions as chapter 4, is likely about 1 m s−1 through the 7 mm diameter
65
glass tube. Assuming 10 nm diameter particles with a photoelectric quantum yield of ϕ = 0.1,
equation 5.4 suggests each particle (depending on lamp intensity) obtains a charge of 0.6 to
6, i.e., at least one charge per particle on average.
To compute the rate at which nanoparticles deposit charge, assume from chapter 2 we
produce particles at 0.6 mg h−1. Assuming 10 nm diameter copper particles, this is 3.5 ×
1010 particles/s. Assume 90% are lost in the system for assorted reasons, so a net total of
3.5 × 109 particles/s are generated, sent through tubing, and deposited. At one charge per
particle, the charge deposition rate should be 3.5 × 109 charges/s or 0.6 nA.
We ran the experiment with copper nanoparticles and observed particles depositing on the
substrate, but we measured an average charge deposition of (0.00 ± 0.01) nA (controlling for
presence of UV light and signal noise). Noise limits only let us measure down to 0.01 nA, less
than two orders of magnitude below our expected 0.6 nA signal. That is: we are confident
particles moved through the UV charger and deposited on the substrate with whatever
electric charge they possessed, but we observed no current meaning we remain unsure whether
they were charged or not.
We hypothesize that particles were successfully charged when hit with a photon but a range
of factors lowered the resulting signal below the range we were able to detect:
• Perhaps charging was successful but the increased charge increased particle loss sticking
to tubing walls between charging and deposition. A more careful reading of the existing
literature [258] reveals charged particles are often collected quickly after charging.
• From chapter 2, the particles have a range of diameters; they are not uniformly 10 nm.
If the average particle size is larger but charge per particle is constant, the deposited
current decreases. Smaller particles might not be charged with our 222 nm light.
• Diffusion (dis)charging—gas atom collisions—may have reduced charge per particle.
• The photoelectric quantum yield might have been less than the assumed 0.1.
• Because particles were insulators, their charge might not have transferred to the sub-
strate (Faraday cup). Solving the oxidation problem as outlined in chapter 4 would fix
this. We used copper nanoparticles due to their low work function; gold nanoparticles
do not oxidize but have a higher work function (see table 5.2).
Any of these could easily have decreased the signal by an order of magnitude; all together,
we are not surprised our signal was not above the 0.01 nA we could measure.
This suggests useful steps to build and successfully demonstrate a working nanoparticle
generator in future work. Increasing UV lamp energy and intensity can increase charge per
particle, using non-oxidizing conditions might deposit charge reliably, collecting particles
quickly minimizes losses, and increasing measurement resolution is also helpful.
Finally, as a separate test, we tried operating the UV lamp inside the vacuum chamber.
This might be useful in the future for charging nanoparticles in vacuum to minimize gas
interactions. Unfortunately, as shown in figure 5.6, at pressures below 10 Torr the lamp
stopped working; its light output changed. Further experimentation suggested an amusing
66
reason: the lamp construction consisted of a low-pressure KrCl gas in a sealed glass tube
with metal electrodes on each side (i.e., both outside the tube and touching atmosphere).
In standard operation, a high voltage AC potential between these electrodes capacitively
couples to the gas inside to drive a plasma: this is a dielectric barrier discharge lamp [277].
However, when the surrounding atmosphere reached sufficiently low pressures, the lamp
drive electrodes instead coupled to this atmosphere to make a gas discharge plasma from
this surrounding gas (in our case, air) instead of the desired KrCl. Fixing this problem is
straightforward but requires a different lamp geometry6.
Figure 5.6: Left: close-up picture of the UV lamp bulb in normal operation. The lamp
tube is a double-walled hollow cylinder; low-pressure Kr and Cl gas is contained between
the walls. There is a mesh electrode around the outside cylinder and a solid electrode in the
center area (also at atmospheric pressure). Right: at low exterior pressures, the indicated
small cylindrical area (the closest distance between outer and inner electrodes at exterior
pressures) becomes an excited air (nitrogen and oxygen) plasma. The color has changed due
to different plasma composition.
In conclusion, we understood the theory behind charging nanoparticles but were not able to
convincingly demonstrate this in experiment. However, we believe we understand our failure
and can modify our apparatus to work in the future; problems included inability to obtain
a sufficiently bright UV lamp, insufficient measurement resolution, and poor setup. The
literature [258] still provides a convincing existence proof that a charger is possible.
We are now ready to continue our journey to figure out how to manipulate and focus nanopar-
ticles with electric fields in chapter 6, though our current lack of charged particles to exper-
iment with means we will have to continue in theory only.
6We were not able to fit the construction of a custom deep-UV lamp within our project’s scope.

Chapter 6
Electrostatic Manipulation
We are finally ready to discuss the final step required for nanoparticle printing: using electric
fields to move the particles. The approaches of previous chapters were not sufficiently precise
or fast to build a good nanoparticle printer, but electrostatics can do better. Furthermore,
contemplating this will let us write down quantitative theoretical limits on how good and
fast nanoparticle printing can ever possibly be1. We will have some success.
Recall that chapter 3 concluded printing semiconductor devices requires shooting particles
of 1 nm to 50 nm diameter at a substrate at well-controlled velocities somewhere between
100 m s−1 and 3000 m s−1 and with positioning accuracy below our final desired printing
resolution, perhaps 1 µm. (Afterward, all we have to do is move the substrate back and
forth on an XY stage while switching materials to have a multimaterial nanoscale printer,
and these last parts are—relatively—easy, as demonstrated in chapter 4.) Furthermore, we
argued the two feasible methods to do this are manipulating the nanoparticles with gas
molecules or with electric fields.
We considered the first nanoparticle manipulation approach, colliding nanoparticles with gas
atoms, in chapter 4. Although we found these aerosol methods were capable of conveniently
transporting particles in several ways (and we were able to successfully print some basic
multimaterial structures with them), theoretical limits from Brownian motion meant this
would never be able to focus nanoparticles to achieve printing resolutions below 1 µm (in
practice, 10 µm, and only for larger particles). These methods also had poor control over
nanoparticle impact velocity. Achieving convenient semiconductor device manufacturing as
contemplated in chapter 1 requires something better, and the only remaining possibility is
electrostatic manipulation.
Thus, in this chapter, we investigate moving nanoparticles with electric fields. We will assume
nanoparticles have a fixed electric charge (perhaps 1e to 100e) according to our methods in
chapter 5, then design electric fields to move them to our desired positions and velocities.
Since we were unable to implement nanoparticle charging in chapter 5, we will run computer
simulations instead of physical experiments, which we leave to future work.
1The superlative language in this chapter introduction may not be perfectly justified, but we think our
arguments (see, for example, section 6.5.3) are sufficiently solid to excuse our use of the literary device.
68
6.1
The Focusing Problem
The one problem we haven’t solved yet is how to deliver nanoparticles to a very small area.
We have solutions for everything else (nanoparticle generation, large-scale manipulation, and
charging), so let’s simplify this last problem as far as possible.
Suppose we take our printer from chapter 4, add a photoelectric charger from chapter 5, and
deliver charged nanoparticles into a vacuum chamber. The chamber would be at our choice
of gas pressure, possibly down to high vacuum if desired2.
We now have what appears to be a simple physics problem: charged particles start with
random position, speed, and direction in a circular area 100 µm to 1000 µm wide (depending
on aerosol nozzle qualities). We want to move as many particles as possible into a much
smaller area, printing them onto a substrate within 1 µm or better. How can we do this?
The answer—the rest of this chapter—turns out to be surprisingly complex and nuanced.
Figure 6.1: Left: starting with an aerosol printer as built in chapter 4, move the nozzle away
from the substrate and there is room to add an electrostatic mechanism to focus particles.
Right: an annotated cartoon of how this mechanism has to work (drawn turned 90 degrees).
A wide beam of particles needs to be focused to a smaller area. Call the direction of movement
from source to substrate “axial” and the perpendicular direction(s) “radial”.
To analyze this problem, we will assume3 particles mostly travel forward in a single direction
(they won’t stop or travel sideways very much, for example), which forms a nanoparticle beam
(that particles travel close to the average beam position is called the paraxial approximation).
Name the direction from nanoparticle source to substrate the axial direction, and movement
perpendicular to that the radial4 direction (a cylindrical coordinate system). A particle with
2Nanoparticles can be moved to high vacuum with a skimmer as briefly mentioned in chapter 4.
3We will justify this assumption in many cases in section 6.3.1, but we will also actually find reasonable
circumstances where particles travel backward for a short while in section 6.4.2.
4Sometimes “transverse” is used instead of radial and “longitudinal” instead of axial [296].
69
a radial position of zero is centered on the beam axis; our particles start with random radial
positions in 0 µm to 500 µm and need to end with positions less than 0.5 µm—100x to 1000x
smaller! We also want particles to end up with a high and well-controlled axial velocity.
For later reference, record the starting and ending conditions we want:
Start (exit nozzle)
End (deposit)
Beam diameter
0.1 mm to 1 mm
< 0.001 mm (< 1/100th input)
Axial velocity
±50% in 100 m s−1 to 300 m s−1
±10% in 100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1
Particle diameter
±50% in 1 nm to 50 nm
(no change)
Particle charge
±2 in 1 e to 100 e
(no change)
Table 6.1: Particle input and desired output conditions. We will add additional constraints
(emittance) later in table 6.3. The beam diameter is double the maximum radial position of
any particle. We can choose mean values for speed, diameter, and charge inside the given
range, at which point the tolerance represents variance around that mean. Particle charges
are integer multiples of the elementary charge e. Tolerances are approximate.
All these parameters vary, and the combined wide parameter range is the primary reason
focusing is so difficult: the same mechanism that focuses a +3 charge 20 nm particle moving
at 300 m s−1 is unlikely to also focus a +1 5 nm particle at 100 m s−1 by the same amount.
Initial particle speed is determined by aerosol nozzle (chapter 4) and is dependent on particle
size. As in chapter 2, particle generation results in a broad size distribution (perhaps a 500%
spread in diameters, almost an order of magnitude—e.g., 5 nm to 25 nm), though we can
select a narrow slice of this via filtration (at the expense of lower throughput). We assume a
50% variation is a good compromise between consistency and nanoparticle generation rate,
but note particle mass scales with the cube of the diameter, so 50% diameter variance is a
350% mass variance! Finally, particle charge is somewhat controllable as discussed in chapter
5 but may vary (different diameters give different photoionization thresholds, etc).
6.2
Electrostatic Nanoparticle Movement
To analyze particle movement, we will begin by reviewing basic electrostatic forces. The
fundamental law governing charged particle movement is the Lorentz force, which states
a particle with charge q and velocity vector ⃗v in an electric field ⃗E and magnetic field ⃗B
experiences the force ⃗F = q( ⃗E + ⃗v × ⃗B). We also have Newton’s second law, of course, with
⃗F = m⃗a for particle mass m and acceleration ⃗a. Together, these laws completely determine
how a particle moves inside a given time-varying electromagnetic field5. Assume for now the
particles and fields are inside a perfect vacuum. Applying a voltage across two conductive
electrodes makes an electric field ⃗E in the empty space between them.
To simplify calculations we make several assumptions. First, assume each particle is merely
5To a good first approximation.
This ignores relativistic effects and emitted radiation (cyclotron or
bremsstrahlung/braking), for example, but the effect on our particular calculations will be negligible.
70
a point mass and charge6. Second, ignore magnetic fields—since particles are relatively slow,
the force from electric fields will be much greater7. Finally, assume electrode electric fields are
quasielectrostatic, i.e., depend only on electrode voltages at that instant8, and are unaffected
by the particles (image charge effects). Thus the force on each particle is merely
⃗F ≈q · ⃗E
(6.1)
(that is, a particle in an electric field experiences a force in the direction of the field, scaling
with charge and field strength), and now we can proceed with straightforward calculations.
A basic demonstration of electrostatic movement is as follows. In a perfect vacuum, add two
conductive pieces of metal (“electrodes”) and apply a constant voltage between them. This
creates an electric field in the space in between and around the electrodes. The strength
of the field is approximately the voltage divided by distance (measured in volts per meter).
Now put a particle of nonzero charge q in midair between these electrodes (if the particle
has no charge, nothing happens). The particle will be pushed with force ⃗F = q · ⃗E, and its
trajectory can be determined by ⃗F = m⃗a (we use vector notation ⃗v for any 3D vector).
Figure 6.2: An electric field (red arrows, conventionally drawn from high to low potential,
which we call the direction of the field) is created between electrodes, in this case by applying
a 100 V potential difference. Note the field curves at electrode edges. Positively charged
particle A is pushed in the field direction (from chapter 5, our particles will generally have a
positive charge). Particle B has a negative charge, so it is pushed in the opposite direction.
Positively charged particle C has initial velocity ⃗v0 and continues in that direction but is
also pushed down like particle A, resulting in a parabolic trajectory.
These basic ideas are enough to start considering what it takes to achieve particle movement
to solve our focusing problem of section 6.1: how can we focus a beam of particles?
6This is valid as the nanoparticle diameter is much smaller than any other system dimension. We assume
also negligible effects from magnetic moments, which is reasonable given we use no magnetic fields.
7A 1000m/s particle in a reasonably large 100 mT field experiences a force equivalent to a single charge in
a 100 V m−1 electric field, but most fields in this work are orders of magnitude greater, perhaps 100 V cm−1
= 10 kV m−1 or more. SEMs and particle accelerators have much higher particle velocities resulting in larger
magnetic Lorentz forces and therefore make more use of magnetic fields instead of electric fields.
8This is valid because we use no magnetic fields and also because the frequencies at which electric fields
change will be below 1 MHz with wavelengths (300 m) far greater than the size of the system or nanoparticle
travel path. This will simplify electric field calculations.
71
6.3
Radial Focusing
Now that we have a way to create electric fields and analyze their effects on particle motion,
it is time to turn to solving the particle movement challenge presented in section 6.1 and
table 6.1. We can divide this problem into two parts:
• We need to focus particles in the radial direction, from a broad beam over 100 µm wide
to a much more narrow beam less than 1 µm wide. This gives high printing resolution.
• Simultaneously, we want to adjust particle velocities in the axial direction so the impact
velocity is well-controlled and within the 100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1 range.
It will turn out the final solutions for these two subproblems are somewhat independent, so
we will address them one at a time. Radial focusing is more difficult; we will start there.
As an illustrative partial solution, consider a broad beam of positively-charged nanoparticles
we would like to print on a substrate as in figure 6.3. If the substrate is at a known voltage
and a ring-shaped high voltage electrode is set just above, an electric field will be formed that
pushes particles inward radially (in addition to some axial acceleration) to move through the
hole in the high-voltage electrode before impacting the substrate. The final printed deposit
is smaller than the original beam diameter; the particles are focused. This setup also has
some significant drawbacks, but we can use it to introduce some important ideas.
Figure 6.3: Left: 3D computer simulation of a beam of nanoparticles deflected inward by an
electric field (red arrows) to impact a smaller area on the substrate. Right: the electric field
in a 2D plane (blue) can also be visualized as a potential energy surface (height measured
in volts) that particles travel through, with 2D projections of particle paths above.
The first idea is we can use computer simulation to calculate the exact shape of the electric
field and resulting particle motion. Although we also use hand calculations and intuition
to make some approximate broad statements and check the simulation (e.g., comparing the
magnitudes of particle kinetic energy and electric potential can suggest how much focusing
happens), the full field shape is complex. The specific software we use is SIMION 8.29 [297].
9SIMION [297] is industry-standard software for simulating particles in electric fields to design ion optics.
Fields are computed by solving the Laplace equation via a finite difference method, then particle trajectories
are found by integrating ⃗F = m⃗a over time. (We also use Python [298] and Blender [299] to display results.)
72
Second, instead of visualizing the electric field as arrows, we can draw an electric potential
surface as shown in the right of figure 6.3. We take a 2D cross-section of the 3D geometry
and graph the potential at each point on it. Higher potential is higher voltage; electric field
lines point downhill. Particles move in this potential like how large objects would fall down
a slope due to gravity. These plots are more exact and easier to draw than arrows.
Now: this radial focusing method partially works; what are the downsides?
One primary drawback is the need for substrate charge. The method has actually already
been used to good effect in the literature to print structures from nanoparticle aerosols
[46][63][300][69][68] (also cited in chapter 1) or electrohydrodynamic jets [30][301][302][303].
But the substrate must be at a known voltage or charge10, which conflicts with our desire to
print arbitrary geometry with both conductors and insulators (for transistors, for example),
which change the field shape (section 6.5.2). We’d like to focus particles without relying on
the substrate’s electrical properties, so we need a different method.
Other important flaws are that focusing requires very low particle axial velocities or very
high voltages, and there is a fundamental minimum to how much focusing is possible—we
would never be able to fit the entire 0.1 mm incoming beam of table 6.1 into a sub-1 µm spot.
These limits are the same as for Einzel lenses, which we will discuss in the next section.
6.3.1
Ion Optics, Einzel Lenses, and Emittance Limits
We still need to figure out how to focus particles radially, but we now have the additional
constraint that the focusing mechanism shouldn’t include the substrate as an electrode.
This makes things harder. Fortunately, significant prior art exists, and there is a beautifully
simple expression (emittance) that tells us what we need to do.
Ion optics (or charged particle optics, or electron optics) is the study of moving electrically
charged particles (electrons or atomic ions) with electric and magnetic fields in vacuum
[296][304][305]. The name comes from certain behavior analogous to light ray optics. Ion
optics sees use in in scanning electron microscopes, particle accelerators11, mass spectrome-
ters, trapped ion quantum computing, cathode ray tube displays, and focused ion beam tools
(see section 6.5.4), among others (see appendix A). The field is mature, and the focusing
problem as laid out in section 6.1 is very familiar—it is almost identical to concerns in SEMs
and FIBs except that the use of large nanoparticles is uncommon. Ion optics has a simple
(partial) solution to the focusing problem: the Einzel lens [305][306].
An Einzel lens focuses a beam of charged particles. The beam travels through the lens and is
made to converge, just like a converging optical lens does for light [306]. The Einzel lens itself
consists of three ring electrodes with the center ring at a different voltage from the other
two; the particle beam travels through the holes in the rings. Particles are slowed down
by the first pair, slightly change direction depending on their distance from the beam axis,
then are sped up to their original velocity (and energy) by the second pair. To a first-order
approximation, the direction change is proportional to radial position.
10Attracting particles to a charged pattern is xerography; this is how paper laser printers work.
11SEMs and particle accelerators can use magnetic instead of electric fields due to higher particle velocities.
73
Figure 6.4: Einzel lens simulation in the same style as figure 6.3. Left: 3D render of lens and
particle trajectories. Right: the potential energy field of the lens. The particles don’t meet
exactly at the focal point (the beam diameter is nonzero) due to some variation in incoming
particle mass, velocity, and nonzero incoming angle.
In order to focus a beam, the height of the Einzel lens potential surface (its voltage times
particle charge) must be close to the incoming kinetic energy of the particles. If the lens
energy is low, particles are focused more gradually (the focal point is further away); if too
high, the particles are reflected backward.
This is the first indication an Einzel lens is not the right tool for us. Our nanoparticles
have a wide range of masses and thus kinetic energies (possibly 350% variation; see table
6.1). Thus different particles will be focused significantly differently or not at all (more
correctly, particles with a different mass-to-charge ratio will be focused differently; with the
laws ⃗F = q ⃗E = m⃗a, we have ⃗a = (q/m) ⃗E so the ratio is the only determinant of particle
trajectory). This is an extreme case of chromatic aberration12. A second related problem is
large fast particles need unrealistically high voltages to focus.

Table 6.2: The kinetic energies (total, not per atom as in chapter 3) of assorted copper
nanoparticles at different velocities, in electronvolts. A 1000 m s−1 10 nm particle with a
single charge needs an Einzel lens voltage of up to 14 600 V to be focused. Note this requires
high vacuum; it would cause Paschen breakdown (see figure 2.4) at higher pressures.
If we were to filter particles even more to reduce variation in diameter and thus energy, and
only use smaller particles at low speeds, this might start to work; there already exist several
papers studying Einzel lenses to focus nanoparticles for deposition [308][309][99][100]. But
there is another reason Einzel lenses are insufficient for what we want to do.
12In ion optics, chromatic aberration primarily refers to focusing imperfections due to a spread in particle
kinetic energies. Reducing chromatic aberration is possible in only limited cases [307]. Spherical aberration
is imperfect focusing due to lens shape, separate from the more fundamental emittance limits we will discuss
soon. Astigmatism is deformation of the beam radial symmetry; we neglect it here. See [305] for more.
74
Einzel lenses have a second fundamental limit: emittance. Perfect focusing is impossible.
The emittance limit actually applies to virtually all ion optics, including our first radial
focusing method in section 6.3, and even if all particles were the same diameter with the
same charge and velocity (so there is no chromatic aberration).
The limit goes like this. Any beam of nanoparticles spreads out at some nonzero angle and
at its narrowest point has some nonzero diameter—a beam is never perfectly collimated or
focused. We can define a quantity called the beam “emittance” equal to the beam diameter
times the spread angle at some point. It turns out this is a conserved quantity: no matter
how we bend and focus the beam, the emittance will never decrease (but it can increase).
If we want to focus the beam by decreasing its diameter, the beam angle must increase to
compensate—and basic geometry limits the half-angle to 90◦.
Figure 6.5: Cross-section cartoon of theoretical focusing limits due to emittance. Any beam
of particles has nonzero half-angle θ0 and at its narrowest some nonzero diameter dB0. The
diameter-angle product dB0θ0 is the emittance. In an energy-conserving system (like particles
moving in electrostatic fields in vacuum), the only way to reduce emittance is by removing
some of the beam, e.g., with an aperture, giving a beam with a different diameter dB1 and
angle θ1 (though brightness will decrease). Focusing the beam while keeping all particles
will at best preserve emittance giving dB1θ1 = dB2θ2, and θ2 < 90◦limits how small dB2 can
be. (Also, the diameters and angles can be replaced with areas AB and solid angles Ω.)
This theorem is well-known in ion optics (with minor variations; for a better discussion see
[296]). Stated with a bit more precision: consider the movement of ions in a perfect vacuum
through a non-time-varying electric field (potential). It can be shown the Lorentz force in
this case is conservative, i.e., particle energy is shifted between kinetic and potential but
always remains constant. Now consider a group of particles, each with their own initial
positions and velocities. According to Liouville’s theorem from Hamiltonian mechanics, the
density of this group in phase space is constant, so if particles start and end at the same
potential they end with an equally large group of positions and velocities. Alternatively: the
system is time-reversible (could be run backward), so there is no case where two particles
with different initial conditions end up in the same final position.
75
There are several mostly-equivalent ways to define emittance13. In figure 6.5 we define the
minimum diameter14 dB of a beam and the half-angle θ it spreads out at; dBθ is constant.
Note θ is approximately the ratio of radial to axial velocity (when θ is small, i.e., the paraxial
approximation). Instead of dBθ, we can also use the minimum beam area AB = πd2
B/4 and
the solid angle Ω≈πθ2 and conserve ABΩ, but the 2D version remains simplest to use.
dB1θ1 ≤dB2θ2
or
AB1Ω1 ≤AB2Ω2
(6.2)
Again, emittance cannot decrease, given the theorem’s assumptions, though it can increase
via nonlinearity or focusing imperfection15.
This is unfortunate as we want both small
diameter and small angle (for more reliable impact and larger depth of field), i.e., we want
small emittance. But there are minor loopholes.
One main way to decrease emittance in a vacuum is physically removing some of the beam,
maybe by blocking it with an aperture (a hole in a flat plate). The remaining beam can have
lower emittance but contains fewer particles (in our case, this would make printing slower).
To account for this, define the volumetric flux Q (the total volume of nanoparticles moving
in the beam per second) (units m3/s), and define the volumetric brightness Q/(AB ·Ω). This
volumetric brightness16 is conserved even through an aperture.
The other way to decrease emittance is accelerating particles to a higher axial velocity, which
stretches out the beam to give a smaller solid angle while keeping area constant. Particles
must start and end at different potentials. This is called an “immersion lens” for analogies
to light optics; a basic Einzel lens is not one as its start and end potentials are identical.
Increasing axial velocity va while preserving radial velocity vr reduces angle θ approximately
linearly (and Ωscales with 1/v2
a), so vaθ or v2
aΩis conserved17.
These quantities are the main figures of merit for a particle beam: the minimum beam area
AB (or diameter dB), solid angle Ω(or half-angle θ), axial velocity va (note radial velocity vr
satisfies θ ≈vr/va and Ω≈π(vr/va)2), and volumetric flux Q. We can write these together
as the “reduced volumetric brightness”, which is conserved similar to emittance:
Q1

.
(6.3)
This is enough to understand how much focusing is theoretically possible18.
(Incidentally, the same theorems can apply near-identically in light optics [314][315], specifi-
cally linear optical systems. For a given beam of light, define the “´etendue” G = n2AΩ(units
m2sr) for area A, solid angle Ω, and index of refraction n, then also define the “radiance”
L = Φ/(AΩ) (units W/m2sr) using radiant power Φ (units W). Combine these together as
“basic radiance” L/n2 = Φ/G = Φ/(n2AΩ) (units W/m2sr). Basic radiance is conserved
13Accelerator physics in particular uses more complex but precise definitions [296][310].
14Sometimes the minimum diameter is called the size of a virtual source.
15Aberrations preserve emittance but can deform it so much it acts increased for practical purposes [296].
16Ion and electron beam systems measure flux as a current and call the result “brightness” [311][304][296].
17Ion beam systems define “reduced brightness” with voltage V instead of squared axial velocity v2
a [312].
18It is possible to refine this limit slightly with spherical and chromatic aberration calculations [313].
76
analogous to equation 6.3. In 2D cross-section using the half-angle θ ≈
p
Ω/π, one can also
define the numerical aperture NA ∝nθ and lens f-number N ∝1/θ. Immersion microscopy
is moving light into a medium of higher refractive index n. Synchrotron brilliance is radiance
per wavelength. All this describes focusing limits to light19.)

Table 6.3: Approximate particle input and desired output conditions. This is the same as
table 6.1 but we also specify the beam half-angle and clarify the diameter is the minimum
anywhere along the beam at that angle. The 5◦initial half-angle is based on our results from
chapter 4. Volumetric flux is the range chapter 2 indicated is feasible.
We can now use equation 6.3 (which includes equation 6.2) to easily calculate whether ion
optics can achieve the focusing we want. For example: unrealistically assuming no chromatic
aberration for the moment, we can focus the beam to a minimum diameter of
dB2 = dB1θ1
θ2
= 0.1 mm · 5◦
30◦
= 16 µm.
(6.4)
That’s not great; we want resolution over an order of magnitude better. This doesn’t improve
much on aerosol focusing (though it should handle small particles better), and chromatic
aberration from the spread of particle sizes and charges would significantly reduce the benefit
as previously noted. We would get some additional improvement from increasing particle
velocity, but our only way to do that is electrostatic acceleration, suffering from the same
chromatic aberration flaws as lenses (see section 6.4.1).
We could also use an aperture to reduce the diameter by another 10x at the cost of reduced
volumetric flux. Since beam area scales with diameter squared, that would leave approxi-
mately 1/102 = 1/100 of the original flux, reducing print speed by orders of magnitude (see
section 6.5.3). This might also run into clogging issues—such a small aperture is microscale,
making this essentially stencil lithography as briefly mentioned in chapter 4.
19The reader may know that a magnifying glass on Earth can focus sunlight to start a fire [314]. Radiance
and ´etendue calculations show this can also work with starlight (albeit with a 10 km wide lens), but not
moonlight. When a sunbeam bounces off the moon, it reflects in a diffuse (Lambertian) way, spreading over
an entire hemisphere and only partially reaching Earth. The resulting ´etendue of moonlight is about 1× 105
times larger and even an infinitely large lens would fail to achieve sufficient intensity. A solution is to make
the moon surface a mirror (avoiding ´etendue change).
77
At this point we see ion optics may be close to achieving our 1 µm resolution—and we can
maybe get there if we’re willing to accept impractical particle filtering and slow print speed
constraints—but we’re uncertain how feasible the result will be. Can we do even better?
There is one final loophole [316] in the emittance theorem: breaking the premise that particle
motion is conservative. We can add a force other than time-invariant electrostatic fields.
6.3.2
Damping and Quadrupole Ion Traps
We just deduced time-invariant electrostatic fields by themselves are not quite good enough.
If we want to focus particles radially with sub-1 µm resolution, we need to actively add or
remove energy from each nanoparticle to get around the emittance theorem.
One (impractical) approach is to change the electric fields with feedback. For example, if we
were able to somehow track the position of a nanoparticle, we could adjust the electric fields
around it in real time (by changing electrode voltages) to direct its motion. Unfortunately,
tracking each individual particle is infeasible20: we might have over 1 × 1010 particles per
second, each moving at 1000 m s−1 over tens of millimeters, where each particle is less than
100 nm wide and has charge q < 100e (not very far from single atoms), and tracking needs
sub-1 µm precision with microsecond time resolution. These tracking system specifications
are somewhat ridiculous to meet. We must make do without closed-loop control21.
Instead, our solution is to add a damping force. In addition to time-invariant electric fields,
add a force that slows down (dampens) particle motion in all directions22. Over time, each
particle will lose both kinetic and potential energy until it has moved to the local minimum23
of the the electrostatic potential energy field. This is like marbles rolling around in a round
bowl (a potential energy field, albeit due to gravity). Without damping, like our previous ion
optics, the marbles move forever, never stopping. With damping (air drag and friction) they
slow down until they rest at the center of the bowl (the potential local minimum). Setting
the shape of the electric potential lets us direct where the particles end up.
This damping approach is widely used in particle accelerators, mass spectrometers, and other
trapped ion applications. It is simple, works well, and moves all particles to known positions
without needing to track them individually. It is sometimes called “cooling” because slower
organized movement generally means lower temperature24. Commensurate with its impor-
tance, many ways to create the damping force have been developed [316][318][319][320]:
• Buffer gas cooling: This is just air drag as discussed in chapter 4. Impacts from
(ideally inert) gas atoms, here called buffer gas, slow down particles. This is fairly
universal and common in mass spectrometry [321][322][323], particle accelerators [324],
and elsewhere [325], but cools to a nonzero limit. Also called “collisional cooling” [326]
or “collisional focusing” [327][328].
20Tracking and controlling only one particle (not many) is sometimes possible; see feedback cooling.
21Without per-particle closed-loop control. Control of total beam behavior (e.g., current) is possible.
22Damping a beam only in the radial direction would be preferable but we have no way to do so.
23Electric potentials have no local minima; we will address and fix this with ion traps and in appendix A.
24This is tricky as it requires a new definition of temperature for the (usually isolated) particles, e.g., [317].
78
• Laser cooling: A class of techniques that exploit the quantum behavior of particles to
absorb and re-emit photons in specific ways, using photon momentum to slow down the
particle [329] (Doppler cooling, for example, uses the fact that a particle traveling in one
direction will see incoming photons blueshifted and, if those photons’ frequencies were
carefully chosen, will only absorb photons and their momentum from that direction).
Usually only works for single atoms with certain quantum energy levels.
• Cavity cooling: Although standard laser cooling doesn’t work on nanoparticles which
have much messier band structures than single atoms, similar results can be achieved by
clever arrangement of nanoparticles scattering a laser in an optical cavity. This might
be able to cool nanoparticles to near their ground state but methods are still in devel-
opment; it is not obvious how we would implement it25 [332][333][330][334][335][336].
• Sympathetic cooling: Buffer gas cooling but improved by using laser cooling on the
buffer gas (not nanoparticles) to reach lower temperatures [323][337].
• Feedback cooling: In well-controlled circumstances, it actually is sometimes possible
to sense individual particles (either via their electric image charge when resonating
[111][338][321] or optically via scattered light) and sometimes apply electrical or optical
feedback to control their position [339][340][341][342][343]. This remains infeasible for
our large number of particles. Currently investigated mainly for quantum experiments.
• Stochastic cooling: This is the one known way to make feedback cooling practical,
used in particle accelerators: sensing average particle beam asymmetries and applying
a correcting electrical pulse, many times over as the beam circulates [344][345]. Won
the 1984 Physics Nobel [346]. Is not easily applied to our nanoparticles.
• Radiation damping: When sufficiently fast (near lightspeed) particles accelerate,
they emit light with significant momentum, slowing the particle; this can be used to
cool a particle accelerator beam [347][319][318]. Related to synchrotrons.
• Electron cooling: Like gas cooling, except the gas is replaced with a beam of electrons
[348][349]. Used in particle accelerators.
• Ionization cooling: Like gas cooling, except the gas is solid matter (in which nuclei
are ionized as the beam passes through). Shown for muon particle accelerators [350].
• Evaporative cooling: When multiple particles in a beam interact, they share energy
(again like gas cooling) with some distribution; if the fastest are removed (evaporated)
from the beam or trap, the remainder are slower on average [351][352][353].
Of all these methods, buffer gas cooling seems the only feasible option for our nanoparticle
printer. Other methods don’t work on nanoparticles (laser cooling), require much higher
speeds and longer times (stochastic cooling), or lose nanoparticles (evaporative cooling).
Fortunately, buffer gas cooling is also simple to implement: all we have to do is let some
small amount of gas float near the nanoparticles (instead of using high vacuum), and the
particles will be slowed as discussed in section 4.1.1. Ideally the gas should be inert (e.g.,
argon, not oxygen; see section 4.3.3) to avoid chemical reactions with the particles.
25There is some evidence cavity cooling might eventually work for particle beams [330][331].
79
How can we use this buffer gas cooling method to focus particles?
We must create an electric potential field such that an incoming beam of particles, when
slowed by the buffer gas, falls into our desired beam shape. This potential must be lower at
the center at the beam and higher elsewhere. As discussed in appendix A, this cannot be
done with static electric fields due to Earnshaw’s theorem. However, an oscillating field of
the correct shape, generally formed by four parallel rods—a quadrupole—creates an average
potential that pushes particles toward the center, focusing the beam like we want!
Specifically, as detailed in appendices A and B, the oscillating field causes particles to vibrate
back and forth (micromotion), but asymmetry causes particles to feel a time-averaged force
(the ponderomotive force) toward regions of lower electric field magnitude, which acts like
the conservative force of a potential field (the pseudopotential).
Figure 6.6: Particles moving left to right through a quadrupole ion trap with buffer gas, in
the style of figures 6.3 and 6.4. Left: the trap consists of four electrode rods with oscillating
voltages. Right: although the fields oscillate, particles experience an average force over time
which forces them toward the center like a quadratic potential well (the pseudopotential);
see appendix A. When air drag is applied, particles fall down the potential into the center
of the well, focusing the particle beam in a completely different way from an Einzel lens.
This quadrupole setup is relatively easy to design and build reliably. This same configuration
is common for focusing beams of heavy atoms or molecules, either in particle accelerators,
where it is called a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) beam cooler [317][354][355][324][356]
[357], or in mass spectrometers, called a linear quadrupole ion trap [358][321][359][328].
There is one major problem with quadrupole focusing: because buffer gas is omnidirectional,
it also slows down particles in the axial direction. Particles will slow down and eventually
stop over time due to air drag (according to the stopping distance in chapter 4) [328], as
shown in figure 6.7. This is unavoidable since particle motion is exponentially damped with
the same time constant in all directions, so by the time a particle loses 95% of its radial
velocity, for example, it has also lost 95% of its axial velocity. Particles cannot be fully
focused without becoming stuck. A straightforward solution to this axial slowing problem is
superimposing an additional axial electric field to keep particles moving. There are multiple
ways to do this, so we address it in depth in section 6.4. For the remainder of this section,
we assume this is a solvable problem and only consider particle radial motion.
80
Figure 6.7: Trajectories of particles (different colors) moving left to right in a quadrupole
trap. Left: with no air drag, particles move in simple harmonic motion plus an additional
micromotion oscillation. The beam diameter stays the same size it was initially. Right:
when air drag is added, particles move toward the center, falling down the potential shown
in figure 6.6. The beam is focused! However, the particles slow down and eventually stop in
the axial direction; they’d never make it to a substrate. We will fix this in section 6.4.
Assuming axial motion works, we are ready to consider how much we can focus particles.
Consider a single particle in a quadrupole trap. The pseudopotential is formed by electric
fields with nearly infinite resolution, so if a particle were perfectly damped the particle could
be centered nearly exactly. However, the buffer gas molecules continue to hit the nanoparticle
and shift it off center. We’ve brought back Brownian motion! Brownian motion is our main
limit to focusing; for several other considerations see section 6.3.3.
We can approximate the smallest beam diameter we can focus particles to by comparing the
quadrupole pseudopotential, which narrows the beam, to Brownian motion, which expands
it. In appendix A we found the quadrupole pseudopotential (equation A.9) has height
eUT(r) ≈qVT r2

(6.5)
where r is the distance of a particle from the trap center, RT is the distance from trap
center to closest quadrupole electrode, VT is the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude between
quadrupole electrodes, and the particle has mass/charge ratio m/q while the oscillation
frequency is optimized26 (equation A.6) for particles with slightly smaller ratio m0/q0.
Brownian motion is random, not a force in a single direction, but we can conveniently analyze
it (as noted in chapter 4) by noting it gives particles some amount of kinetic energy. Particles
can move in the 2D radial plane perpendicular to the beam and Brownian motion gives 1
2kBT
per dimension of movement, so on average particles have a total of 1kBT of radial energy (in
a random direction) when cooled to the temperature of the gas. Since this is only an average
effect, some particles will have more kinetic energy and make the beam slightly wider, but
here we use only 1kBT in our calculations for simplicity.
26Increasing frequency by ω = s · ωmin gives eUT = eUT min/s2 and (equation 6.6) dBquad = s · dBquad,min.
81
If we set Brownian energy 1kBT equal to eUT(r), we can find an expression for the average
radius of displacement r, and the resulting particle beam diameter dBquad is twice that:

Table 6.4: The beam diameter dBquad nanoparticles of charge q = n·e can be focused to with
a quadrupole built with electrodes of size RT, calculated with equation 6.6 using VT = 100 V
and T = 298 K. We can beat 1 µm resolution, perhaps even 100 nm! Eventually resolution is
limited instead by the diameter of the nanoparticles themselves. These resolutions require
the trap to have particular frequencies as described in appendices A and B; the last row
computes these with equation A.6 for 10 nm Cu particles with q = 1e.
This is excellent: quadrupole ion traps with buffer gas theoretically allow us to focus particles
to sub-1 µm resolutions, finally achieving our original goal from chapter 1! This entire idea
of nanoparticle printing might yet work! However, it requires significant detail.
First, note that with VT = 100 V, T = 298 K, and q = 1e, the beam diameter dB is focused to
≈5% of the space between the electrodes (2RT). A beam starting at dB = 0.1 mm to 1 mm as
in table 6.3 wouldn’t fit in a sub-100 µm quadrupole; we will instead need to focus the beam
through multiple progressively smaller quadrupole stages to reach sub-micron dimensions.
We comment on how to do this (and how to build tiny quadrupoles) in section 6.5.1.
We can improve focus by increasing the trap voltage VT, but only to a point: sufficiently high
voltage will cause electrical breakdown, making the buffer gas into a conductive plasma28.
As described by the Paschen curve in figure 2.4, there is a maximum safe voltage below which
breakdown never occurs. The exact voltage varies with gas, geometry, surface roughness and
other conditions [138]; for this chapter we assume VT = 100 V is always safe29. Alternatively,
we can use a low gas pressure (and trap size), on the left of the Paschen minimum, to
increase the allowed voltage. Many particle accelerator quadrupoles use 0.01 Torr to 0.1 Torr
pressures to reach voltages as high as VT = 1 kV to 10 kV [360][355][357][361][362].
27Approximately. The beam is somewhat Gaussian and subject to some other effects (section 6.3.3).
28Which will distort the electric field, short-circuit electrodes, and generally stop focusing from working.
29We further assume 200 V (VT = 100 V plus 100 V for axial acceleration) is safe in section 6.4.
82
What pressure should the buffer gas be? There is an optimal value. Besides electrical break-
down, at low pressures damping takes longer than necessary (as described by the damping
time constant in chapter 4); high pressures give slower axial movement (section 6.4) and re-
duced micromotion for lower ponderomotive focusing force [355][317]. The gas specifics and
exact damping equation can vary so long as the damping is predictable30. Our simulations
generally use 0.01 Torr to 10 Torr argon in quadrupoles around 100 mm long.
Decreasing the temperature T improves resolution. Some particle accelerator RFQ beam
coolers use liquid nitrogen to reach T = 77 K (vs. 298 K room temperature) [363][362][364].
What about our wide range of particle sizes: 350% variation, according to table 6.3? It
turns out we can probably focus everything at once without worrying about chromatic aber-
ration! All particles will be damped to 1kBT radial thermal motion31 then stay at a constant
minimum diameter which, according to equation 6.6, will only scale with √m so the mass
variation merely doubles the beam diameter.
Particle charge should be as high as possible for better focusing (and higher axial velocity in
section 6.4), though this results in higher space charge effects (section 6.3.3). If we can vary
particle charge based on size (thus mass), as chapter 5 suggests may occur when charging to
a fixed ionization energy, we would reduce mass/charge ratio variation.
We should also note that while simulating quadrupole traps is straightforward, simulating
Brownian motion (see chapter 4), while feasible via statistical methods [215][216][365], is not.
We did not have time to verify a numerical Brownian simulation for our large nanoparticles
at intermediate pressures and so did without. This should not change our conclusions.
6.3.3
Additional Limits to Quadrupole Radial Focusing
We now have a tractable approach to radially focus particles—quadrupoles with buffer gas—
and are ready to tackle the final problem of axial velocity control. But before we switch
discussion from radial to axial particle movement, there are several more32 radial effects we
should mention: space charge, RF heating, and beam expansion outside the trap due to ther-
mal energy. These are all minor but will still affect the ultimate focusing performance.
Space Charge
A beam of nanoparticles contains many particles, and since all these particles have a positive
charge, they will repel each other and make the beam wider, reducing printing resolution.
This effect is called space charge and limits the number of particles in any given beam. Space
charge limits are also a large concern in particle accelerators and electron and ion beam tools.
In these systems, the Child-Langmuir law [296] gives the maximum density of charges that
can be moved axially through a region with a given voltage. But we would like to consider
radial forces for the moment, so we will need to make a different calculation.
30Small quadrupoles can be smaller than the gas mean free path, so quantization effects may appear.
31This is sometimes called thermalization and is roughly why any damping method is called cooling, though
it would be heating if the particles started with a lower velocity.
32Even more effects exist (e.g., electrical noise). See [366] for a review in trapped-ion quantum computing.
83
Define the number flux N ′ as the number of nanoparticles per second moving through the
beam cross-section (N ′ is fixed by the volumetric flux Q and particle diameter dp). When
N ′ is small (as an extreme, N ′ = 1 s−1), particles are so far apart that space charge effects
are negligible and we can achieve the high resolution of table 6.4 without trouble. But if N ′
is sufficiently large, space charge pushes particles out radially.
Figure 6.8: Cartoon of the space charge effect. Electrically charged nanoparticles in the
same beam repel each other with force FSC to make the beam wider (in addition to Brownian
motion), opposing the quadrupole trap ponderomotive force Fquad that makes the beam more
narrow. A total rate of N ′ particles, each with charge q, move through the beam cross-section
(radius rB or diameter dB = 2rB) at axial velocity va.
We can roughly approximate33 the effect of space charge on radial focusing in a quadrupole as
follows [367][360]: compare the quadrupole potential (equation 6.5) to a repulsive potential
from the beam. Approximate the beam as uniform positive charge density within a cylinder
of radius rB = dB/2. Since N ′ is the number of particles per time with charge q moving
through the cylinder cross-section at velocity va, the linear charge density of the cylinder is
qN ′/va (units C m−1). The electric field ⃗E (pointing radially outward) of this cylinder and
corresponding potential energy USC from q ⃗E = −∇USC (setting USC(0) = 0) are

for radial distance r from the beam center. Particles are pushed away from the beam center
via the electric field (i.e., they fall down the potential USC). The beam is stable when this
potential USC is less than the quadrupole pseudopotential eUT(r) (equation 6.5) in the same
way we derived equation 6.6 (but ignoring34 Brownian motion).

33More accuracy could be obtained via particle simulation, modeling the beam with Poisson’s equation.
34This is valid when space charge is a larger effect than Brownian motion; the exact boundary for N ′ we
find will be a slight overestimate of the maximum charge a beam can fit.
84
Rearranging this equation, we find the maximum number flux N ′ that fits in a beam (that
also satisfies equation 6.6) of diameter dB = 2rB with quadrupole trap voltage VT, axial
velocity va, particle charge q, quadrupole trap radius RT, and vacuum permittivity ϵ0:

For example, a beam of diameter dB = 1 µm and va = 1000 m s−1 focused by a trap with
VT = 100 V and RT = 5 µm can move a maximum of N ′
max ≈8.7 × 1010 singly-charged
(q = 1e) particles s−1, which is a current of about 14 nA. We discuss the ramifications of this
space charge limit in section 6.5.3, where it is often the largest constraint on print speed at
high resolutions giving an incentive to use particles of higher mass and lower charge.
RF Heating
Our approximation of a quadrupole as a quadratic potential well for particles has some limits,
and these differences can affect particle motion, typically increasing the beam diameter.
Recall the quadrupole trap works (in appendices A and B) by creating an oscillating electric
field. A particle experiences quick oscillations that we call micromotion, and asymmetry in
the field during micromotion is what provides the average ponderomotive force that makes
the particle act as if it were in a quadratic potential well. This micromotion itself slightly
increases the beam diameter35, but in addition to this, disturbing the particle from an
ideal micromotion trajectory modifies the resulting ponderomotive force which can then be
nonconservative and add kinetic energy. RF heating is any such effect36.
RF heating can happen in many ways. See [323] for an excellent review, or [368][369][365][370]
[371]. Collisions with gas molecules, for example, disturb particle motion and adjust their
micromotion. We can likely neglect single collisions as our nanoparticles are significantly
heavier than the surrounding gas molecules, but the collective behavior (which produces
the drag we use) is statistically nontrivial [365]. Another source of RF heating is multiple
nanoparticles repelling each other37.
This makes nanoparticles rest at a nonzero radial
position, where they have nonzero micromotion.
Finally, particles entering or leaving a
quadrupole out of sync with its oscillations will be deflected in some direction (which is
arguably RF heating); they might only experience half of a micromotion cycle. All these RF
heating effects can be modeled with particle trajectory computer simulations.
Beam Expansion from Thermal Velocity
Our last consideration is what happens when a focused beam of particles leaves a quadrupole,
because there must be some distance between the quadrupole and the substrate we wish to
print particles onto. While in the quadrupole, particles stay within a constant beam diameter
dB but have radial energy 1kBT. As soon as the particles leave the trap at axial velocity va,
35Increase in beam diameter due to expected micromotion oscillations is not usually considered RF heating.
36This occurs in any RF ion trap (see appendix A), hence the name.
37This is what causes space charge repulsion, can also be called intra-beam scattering [372], and can
distribute particles radially by mass/charge ratio [326].
85
the particles will also move outward radially, expanding the beam38. We assume L is small
and va high so drag is negligible. The mean radial velocity vr from kT = 1

r is
vr =

so the beam forms half-angle θ ≈vr/va. If the beam had original diameter dB1 (perhaps

and corresponding beam half-angles for va = 1000 m s−1, assuming density of copper. These
tiny angles give low emittance so the ion optics of section 6.3.1 might actually be useful.
As a result of this effect, we may need to place the output of a quadrupole focusing mechanism
close to the substrate (see section 6.5.1). For example: if 10 nm particles travel with an axial
velocity va = 100 m s−1, then printed spot diameter increases 2vr/va ∗1 µm = 26 nm for each
micrometer of distance L from the substrate; at 1000 m s−1 this is only 2.6 nm. Achieving
high resolution < 1 µm probably requires putting the quadrupole exit within tens of microns
of the substrate. Fortunately, this is feasible: machine tools and XYZ stages easily maintain
position within 10 µm. Quadrupole focusing, as in table 6.4, is the bigger limit.
Alternatively, note the beam exiting the quadrupole can have low emittance (see table 6.5),
so we might allow the beam to travel a long L while expanding, then use standard ion optics
(e.g., an Einzel lens) to focus it back over a similarly long39 L if we can achieve sufficiently
low chromatic aberration. We make some remarks in section 6.5.1.
38This derivation also appears (with experimental confirmation) in [214] for aerodynamic lenses and super-
sonic gas jets [325], and as an upper limit for brightness of electron sources at some temperature [296][373].
39This is how SEMs and FIBs can place their electron and ion optics far from a substrate.
86
6.4
Axial Acceleration
We are halfway to solving the particle focusing problem of section 6.1. We found a way to
radially focus nanoparticles to small sub-1 µm areas by using quadrupole traps with buffer gas
cooling, but also found we will need to somehow keep particles moving in the axial direction
without being stopped by the buffer gas. Furthermore, in order to control printed material
quality (see chapter 3), we want to set the axial speed of the particles when they impact the
substrate to some adjustable value we can choose within va = 100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1.
A solution exists. We will be able to control particle axial speed, i.e., accelerate particles to a
desired velocity. The fundamental trick we will use is that quadrupoles only control particle
motion in the radial direction; axial movement is separate and can be controlled with its
own electric field. We will first present a relatively simple approach (DC acceleration) and
its limits then discuss a more advanced axial acceleration system (a linac).
6.4.1
DC Acceleration
The easiest method to make particles continue to move axially (instead of being slowed and
stopped by gas damping) is to apply a DC40 field in the axial direction, resulting in the basic
1D electrostatic movement discussed in section 6.2.
The most straightforward way to achieve this is to divide the quadrupole electrodes into axial
segments onto which are applied the oscillating voltages required for the quadrupole plus
a DC bias voltage that increases in the axial direction. The oscillating voltage component
creates a quadrupole pseudopotential and the DC bias voltages create an axial field; they add
together by superposition (the electric field is linear in voltage). Particles are now focused
radially by the quadrupole with gas damping and also accelerated axially.
Figure 6.10: Left: we can take the quadrupole of section 6.3.2 and figure 6.6 and apply an
axial electric field by segmenting the electrodes and applying an increasing DC bias ψ to each
set (here, an additional 5 V per segment). Right: The resulting potential and pseudopotential
field the particle moves in is a quadratic well that slopes down in the axial direction.
40By DC for “direct current” we mean an electric field or voltage is time-invariant, as in any ion optics in
section 6.3.1, as opposed to, e.g., the oscillating-in-time electric field of a quadrupole trap.

Particle trajectory simulations show this works. Particles have damped radial motion but
keep moving in the axial direction, eventually producing a narrow beam with the diameter
dBquad we computed in equation 6.6. We have successfully made a highly focused beam!
Figure 6.11: Trajectories of particles in a quadrupole with buffer gas, which focuses them
radially, and DC acceleration, which keeps them moving in the axial direction. We have
successfully made a focused beam! This continues figure 6.7 (and in fact uses an identical
simulation save slightly higher pressure and more particles for visualization). The final beam
diameter should be dBquad from equation 6.6 but, as briefly mentioned in section 6.3.2, the
simulation results are slightly better than this since we only simulate drag and not Brownian
motion. The general behavior is realistic.
This is not a new idea. Axial DC fields, both with and without a quadrupole, are common:
they are the most basic way to move particles electrostatically (see section 6.2).
Any quadrupole using a buffer gas will run into the same axial slowing issue and solution. Us-
ing segmented electrodes to simultaneously create a radial quadrupole field and axial DC field
is common practice in particle accelerator RFQ beam coolers [317][354][374][375][324][356]
[357][376] and mass spectrometry linear quadrupole traps [328][377]. There are also ways41 to
create the axial field without segmenting the quadrupole, reducing the number of electrodes:
the quadrupole electrodes can be tapered and slanted [379][328][380] or crosscut and twisted
[364], or additional DC-only electrodes added around or between the quadrupole electrodes
[381][382][362][378], though this distorts the quadrupole field [328][378].
Axial fields are also used without a quadrupole when focusing is not required. Applications
include (see also chapter 3) ionized cluster beam deposition (ICBD) [178][47] which prints
nanoparticles over a wide area instead of in a focused beam, ion optics for SEMs, FIBs, and
ion implantation, micrometeoroid impact studies [198][199], and electrostatic precipitators
[102]. Axial electric fields have been proposed to further accelerate particles in cold spray
and aerosol deposition42 [98][383][384]. We should also mention ion mobility spectrometry
[210][385][386] which moves molecules in an axial DC field in buffer gas (sometimes with
a radial RF trap, but a simpler ring design, similar to the ion funnels we will mention in
section 6.5.1, instead of a quadrupole as it does not need to minimize beam diameter).
41Confusingly, some of these nonsegmented geometries are sometimes called Linacs [328][378] with no
relation to the generic linear accelerator linac as used in particle accelerators and section 6.4.2.
42This increases particle impact velocity but does not solve the Brownian focusing limit from chapter 4.
88
We can analyze DC axial acceleration as follows.
First, without gas drag, an axial field of total voltage V will accelerate a particle of mass
m and charge q from zero to a speed of va =
p
2qV/m (from KE = qV = 1
2mv2
a); it adds
qV kinetic energy (this is why the volt is a joule per coulomb). This happens no matter
how long the field is. If we made an axial field without a quadrupole by taking just two of
the three rings of an Einzel lens (section 6.3.1)—an “immersion lens”—whether the two ring
electrodes are 100 µm or 100 mm long does not matter (as long as gas drag is negligible); the
particle will reach the same speed as it travels through.
This speed increase from a gas-drag-free axial field varies with the square root of particle
mass and charge. The square root means this is less sensitive than radially focusing with
other ion optics (which depends directly on the mass/charge ratio). This limited chromatic
aberration means we might find DC axial acceleration useful (if still imperfect) for our wide
range of particle parameters if there is ever low gas pressure and we can use a high enough
voltage: a 10 nm q = 10e copper particle needs a high 1460 V to reach 1000 m s−1.
A particle with gas drag in an axial field acts slightly differently: it will try to increase its
speed as before, but because the gas drag force increases with velocity, it turns out particles
will accelerate up to some steady-state drift velocity43, and this drift velocity depends on
the electric field (the voltage per distance), not the voltage itself. If the particle has viscous
damping coefficient β giving drag force Fdrag = −βva (see chapter 4) and is pulled forward
by an axial electric field E as Ffield = qE, it will slow down or speed up until reaching drift
velocity va,drift defined by
Ffield = qE = βva,drift = −Fdrag
so
va,drift = q
β E = K · E
(6.12)
where we define the electrical mobility44 K = q/β [102][205][211]. We can expand β using
our Epstein drag equation 4.7 to see
va,drift = q

where P is the pressure, mg is the gas molecular mass, φ ≈0.9, and dp is particle diameter.
Because the mass of the particle varies with diameter cubed (m = ρπd3
p/6 where ρ is density),
this steady-state velocity scales with m−2/3, which means there is slightly more chromatic
aberration than the
p
1/m = m−1/2 scaling of gas-free acceleration. Furthermore, a particle
only reaches this velocity if the field E is sustained over a long enough distance (roughly the
gas stopping distance, equation 4.14), which requires high voltage V over long distance L for
E = V/L (at shorter distances, the particle accelerates similar to the no-drag case).
Gas breakdown usually limits the maximum voltage we can use to around 100 V (see section
6.3.2), thus limiting maximum electric field and drift velocity. We can compute the resulting
possible drift velocities for particles of our range of sizes to see what might be practical.
43This is similar to the terminal velocity of falling objects on Earth or electron drift velocity.
44Electrical mobility is a crucial parameter in ion mobility spectrometry, where it is used to precisely
differentiate molecules in a different way than the mass/charge ratio in mass spectrometry [210][385].

particles in a field of 100 V applied over a 100 mm distance (E = 1 V mm−1); parentheses
note a longer distance (and thus higher voltage) is required for the particle to reach that

particles with higher charge q have proportionally higher drift velocities. In the top row,
velocities vary with √m ∝d3/2
p , and in the bottom row by m2/3 ∝d2
p.
As shown in table 6.6, axial DC acceleration in gas cannot quite reach the 100 m s−1 to
3000 m s−1 velocities we want for most particles when allowing only 100 V. Other appli-
cations that use axial fields in gas typically accept this: particle accelerator RFQ beam
coolers [374][376][362][364] and ion mobility spectrometry45 use small fields (1 V to 200 V
per 100 mm), because they only need nonzero (if low) velocity. If we want high velocities, we
must use higher voltages, probably in vacuum. SEMs or ICBD and similar [47][199] use high
voltage (> 1 kV) by working in high vacuum and chromatic aberration is either minimal (if
all particles, e.g., electrons, are the same mass and charge) or ignored.
So DC axial acceleration through a quadrupole as in figure 6.10 works but is limited to low
axial speeds. We could achieve high-speed impact velocities by accelerating in vacuum. But
if we want very precise impact velocities that do not vary with particle size at all, we will
need to use something more than a single axial DC field.
6.4.2
Linacs and Controlled Motion
There is a trick that could let us solve two problems simultaneously. At the cost of extra
complexity, we could accelerate particles of different masses to the same velocity, and we
could also reach higher velocities in a gas than with a simple axial DC field.
The trick is to start with segmented electrodes as in figure 6.10 but instead of applying a
simple voltage gradient, we sinusoidally vary the voltage in the axial direction, making a
number of “buckets” in the electrostatic potential. Background gas damping makes particles
fall into these buckets much as it works for the quadrupole (section 6.3.2). We move the
buckets along the axial direction (making the sinusoid a traveling wave) by changing voltages
on each of the segmented electrodes, and the particles move with them. If we construct this
correctly, all particles move as “bunches” inside the buckets precisely at the speed of the
linac with no chromatic aberration. This is a linear accelerator, or linac.
45Ion mobility spectrometry is interesting as it encourages chromatic aberration; that is how it works.
90
A linac can accelerate particles to higher velocities than a single DC field for the same voltage
because as the field shifts, a particle that has already been accelerated by voltage V can be
pushed again by the same voltage, even though that voltage didn’t change in magnitude (only
position). In high-energy physics, this is how particle accelerators can reach ridiculously high
particle impact energies46 (though our linac is different by including buffer gas).
Figure 6.12:
Beginning with a segmented quadrupole as in figure 6.10, instead of applying
a smoothly increasing DC potential (in addition to quadrupole oscillations), use a wave of
peak-to-peak amplitude VL and wavelength λL (a sinusoid works, but a sawtooth wave with
steeper slope is ideal) that travels in the axial direction at velocity vL. This creates discrete
buckets of electrostatic potential that particles fall into via buffer gas damping.
As the
buckets move at axial velocity vL, the particles move with them at that velocity.
Figure 6.13: The linac works in simulation! These are trajectories of 4 nm to 6 nm Cu q = 5e
particles in a linac, beginning at axial position 125 mm with random velocities 0 m s−1 to
300 m s−1 and times (with respect to linac phase), and all eventually reach the steady-state
vL = 200 meter/s velocity of a linac with VL = 100 V, λL = 40 mm, and 4 mm electrode pitch
(and 100 Pa buffer gas) while forming bunches. The steady-state velocity oscillates due to
the segmented electrodes. The particle drift velocity if the 100 V were applied over 100 mm
is only 35 m s−1; this linac lets them achieve speeds over 5 times higher.
46These can reach TeV particle kinetic energies without a teravolt DC voltage, which is impractical.
91
To analyze the linac, consider the potential particles feel in the axial direction. Let the linac
have peak-to-peak voltage VL, wavelength λL, and velocity vL. The linac creates the axial
potential energy surface UL(x, t) where x is distance in the axial direction and t is time.
Let pL be the distance between linac electrodes (the pitch); we must have pL < λL/2 by
the Nyquist theorem, and preferably pL < λL/4. Let ELmax be the maximum electric field
(because the electrodes are discretized, ELmax varies between VL/pL and VL/2pL throughout
a linac cycle). Let the particles have some mass m, diameter dp, and charge q, and let the
background buffer gas have pressure P (and temperature T, gas molecule mass mg).
Figure 6.14: An annotated diagram of the linac potential waveform. This is a traveling
wave of height UL = qVL, wavelength λL, and velocity vL, created by electrodes at discrete
positions. To maximize the force pushing particles to the right, we maximize the steepness of
the left side of the well, which we do by making a sawtooth wave instead of simple sinusoid.
Electrode discretization means it is more reliable to form the slope from twice the electrode
pitch instead of over one. A beam separates into groups of particles, called bunches.
The behavior of our linac is somewhat complex and unique (particle accelerator linacs typi-
cally operate without buffer gas and with beam acceleration, not at constant velocity), but
initial analysis and simulations lead us to hypothesize it can be roughly47 described with the
following three nondimensional parameters, which we name AL, BL, and CL.
First, note that particles are pushed along by the linac with a maximum force of qELmax and
also experience gas drag; they will move as long as the former is greater than the latter. This
is the same setup as drift velocity in section 6.4.1. We can express this with nondimensional
parameter AL, the ratio of maximum axial electrostatic force to gas drag at linac velocity
vL, and say that a linac and particle function as long as AL > 1.

If AL < 1, then the linac force is insufficient to move the particle at the linac velocity, and
the particle will never move with the linac. It will instead be briefly accelerated by one side
of a linac well as it passes, then decelerated by the other, resulting in oscillatory movement
and minimal net velocity. Fortunately, AL can be made arbitrarily high by minimizing the

92
electrode pitch to maximize ELmax (though this requires more electrodes) and by minimizing
pressure (though this increases CL below and also quadrupole focusing time).
We can use AL to see how fast a linac can be. From table 6.6, find a maximum particle drift
velocity in an electric field of 100 V/100 mm, then note that increasing the field to ELmax in
a linac will scale the velocity proportionally. For example, a singly-charged 10 nm particle
has a drift velocity of only 13.2 m s−1 in a 100 V / 100 mm field at 0.1 Torr but can move
100x faster at 1320 m s−1 if the field is applied over only 1 mm. This is close to reaching the
upper half of the 100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1 impact velocity range we want.
However, there is a second more subtle requirement that applies to only a subset of particles.
If a particle is already within the potential well of a linac at the correct velocity, the AL
parameter is sufficient to describe its behavior. But a particle at a different velocity, or not in
phase with the linac, will skip between potential wells until it slows down and is kept within
a bucket by gas damping, and careful analysis shows this is only possible if a single linac
bucket has enough potential energy to accelerate the particle from zero to linac velocity48.
We define the second nondimensional parameter BL to be the ratio of potential energy of a
single linac well (the particle charge times linac amplitude) to the kinetic energy of a particle
traveling at linac velocity. This is often a stricter limit than AL.

Table 6.7: The maximum velocities of linacs that accept all input particles of some mass
and charge (BL > 1) at VL = 100 V, assuming copper. Small particles have a maximum
charge; see chapter 5. This is one of the major restrictions to how good a linac can be: even
if reaching higher velocities is possible according to the AL parameter, such a linac would
require incoming particles to be presorted into bunches, which is tricky to implement.
This parameter is somewhat optional for a linac depending on desired behavior. Assuming
AL > 1 (or else nothing works): when BL ≫1, all particles no matter their initial conditions
will eventually travel with the linac (for gas drag will bring any particle to zero velocity, from
where the potential well is strong enough to accelerate it). When BL < 1, particles in an
increasingly smaller window of initial parameters will travel with the linac (but, importantly,
the well of a linac can still provide enough energy to speed a slightly slower particle up to
48This is approximately because gas drag will slow a particle of any initial velocity to between 0 and vL,
at which point if a particle isn’t caught by the crest of one bucket, it slips to the next bucket where it is
pushed backward an equal amount by the opposite side, making it oscillate back and forth with little net
motion. It can be helpful to analyze this in a reference frame moving at velocity vL.
93
linac velocity). This means it is possible to create a linac that moves at higher velocities
(BL < 1 and AL > 1) if particles are pre-bunched and fed to the linac at the right time.
We define the final linac parameter CL to be the ratio of total linac length L to the stopping
distance S of a particle in buffer gas (equation 4.14) at linac velocity vL.

(6.16)
When CL is high (perhaps CL > 3), gas drag has time to make particles reach steady state
equilibrium with the linac, making it work as desired according to AL and BL parameters.
But when CL is low (perhaps CL < 3), gas drag will not have time to equilibrate particle
motion to the linac, so final particle velocities will be far from steady-state (i.e., potentially
an unexpected wide range of velocities). This mainly determines linac length.
What can we conclude from this?
It seems like a linac does what we want, allowing us to axially move particles with a range of
mass/charge ratios to a very specific (possibly adjustable) velocity vL we choose. This can
reach higher velocities than simple DC acceleration, which is helpful since DC acceleration’s
drift velocity was a bit low for us. However, it is not a panacea: table 6.7 indicates that
high-velocity linacs (perhaps 1000 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1) require careful particle control, and
the requirement to separate a particle beam into bunches will also reduce the total particles
throughput which we will see strongly limits printing speed (section 6.5.3). Whether a linac
is worthwhile depends on the circumstance.
Although our linac differs from standard particle accelerator linacs49 [296], it is not entirely
dissimilar to existing ideas. Particle accelerator RFQ beam coolers can often apply config-
urable DC biases to their segmented quadrupole electrodes, and they use this (a “buncher”)
to make bunches of particles [357][364][362][356][387]. Traveling wave ion mobility spectrom-
etry uses buffer gas with a very similar axial field to our linac [388][389] but operates in the
AL < 1 regime specifically so different size particles travel at different velocities (see [390]
for experimental measurements showing the AL ≈1 boundary).
There is one more use for these techniques: a linac50 can precisely move particles at slower
speeds, possibly as a better-controlled alternative to the gas drag particle transport methods
we studied in chapter 4. Using traveling waves to move charged particles has been suggested
as an “electric curtain” [391][392][393] for purposes including cleaning dust off solar panels
[394]. This (when more controlled) is also the standard approach to moving particles around
trapped-ion quantum computers [395][396][397][398], and particles can be moved not only in a
single line but through junctions [399][400][401][402][403], allowing particles to traverse a 2D
(or 3D [404]) grid. This has also been used to move molecules for ion mobility spectrometry
[390][405][406][407][408][409][169]. In other words, electrostatic manipulation can be used
for general handling and sorting of particles51, not just for focusing and acceleration.
49Though some similarities exist: linacs in vacuum still have phase stability; particles stay in buckets [296].
It is also possible to accelerate nanoparticles with such a high-vacuum linac [157].
50We could also use the ponderomotive force in the axial direction, but the complexity is unnecessary.
51This might be useful for switching between different materials while printing.

6.5
Complete Electrostatic Focusing Systems
At long last (over 20 pages later!) we finally have everything we need to solve the focusing
problem posed in section 6.1. Recall our goal is to move charged nanoparticles, which begin
with some initial positions and velocities, onto a substrate in a narrow beam (near 1 µm
wide) and at high impact velocities (100 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1), as quantified in tables 6.1 and
6.3. If we accomplish this, we will have found the last part of a printer hopefully capable of
printing useful multimaterial nanoscale semiconductor devices.
In section 6.5.1, we will describe and simulate an example system capable of printing 10 nm
particles with < 5 µm resolution at > 1000 m s−1 and make some notes on how it would be
physically constructed and how resolution could be improved to < 1 µm or better. We will
follow this with more general remarks on printing particles electrostatically.
6.5.1
A Proof-of-Concept Focusing System and Beyond
There are multiple ways to combine our previously-discussed electrostatic manipulation com-
ponents to solve the focusing problem, but to give a concrete working example we designed a
particularly minimal and straightforward configuration. We focus particles in a quadrupole
with buffer gas as per section 6.3.2, but since a single quadrupole is insufficient to focus all
the way (see table 6.4), we add a second quadrupole to further focus the output of the first.
To move particles axially, we choose to use segmented quadrupoles with DC fields (section
6.4.1) because a linac (section 6.4.2) is tricky to implement, then accelerate particles to high
velocities right before impact with the substrate via an extremely high DC field.
Figure 6.15: A (simulated) working electrostatic focusing system that prints 10 nm q = +10e
nanoparticles with < 5 µm resolution at > 1000 m s−1. If built, this could be inserted into an
existing aerosol deposition system (figure 6.18). Bottom left: a schematic (not to scale) of
the system, which has two quadrupoles and a DC accelerating lens just before the substrate.
Top left: a 3D render (to scale) of the system. Top right: close-up cross-section of geometry
near substrate. Bottom right: close-up of junction between quadrupoles.
95
The resulting structure is extremely compact: only 75 mm long and below 5 mm in diameter.
Particles can be injected via aerosol nozzle (another 25 mm long). The main trick this design
uses is allowing low particle velocities in the quadrupoles to maximize focusing time while
minimizing pressure, then using high voltage (avoiding breakdown via low pressure and small
size) to accelerate particles right before impact with a simple DC accelerator lens. This lens is
subject to the emittance theorem but only accelerates axially without focus, avoiding issues.
We accept the chromatic aberration (velocity variation). The particles travel 0.5 mm between
the final lens and substrate (making resolution only 1.3 µm worse by equation 6.11).
We designed each quadrupole by choosing their voltage VT and initial particle beam radius
then making the trap radius RT slightly larger. This combined with particle characteristics
determines trap frequency (equation A.6) and minimum beam diameter (equation 6.6). We
used a frequency 1.6 times minimum to allow a range of particles (8 nm to 12 nm) at some
resolution cost. We chose buffer gas pressures52 high enough to focus quickly yet low enough
(< 1 Torr) to allow high voltage acceleration without breakdown. Segmented electrodes apply
an axial field high enough such that the particle stopping distance is longer than the junction
between quadrupoles. An isolation electrode between the two quadrupoles prevents their
waveforms interfering with each other. We ended up with the following parameters:

After focusing, the particles accelerate through two electrodes (an immersion lens) with a
3 kV DC voltage chosen to reach > 1000 m s−1 as approximated by va =
p
2qV/m (section
6.4.1). Building this requires avoiding gas breakdown due to high voltage (section 6.3.2),
but our 0.4 Torr pressure and the 100 µm electrode separation can probably suffice53 (table
2.4). To avoid having to charge the substrate (section 6.3), the final electrode is grounded
and the quadrupoles are raised to progressively higher voltages. The input aerosol nozzle
can be electrically insulated, moving particles into the quadrupole via drag even when the
main printer chamber is grounded. There would also be a cylindrical shield (not shown)
around the entire focusing mechanism to prevent gas breakdown around its outside.
52The 0.5 vs. 0.4 Torr pressure difference is unnecessary but demos differential pumping (chapter 4).
53[355] confirmed 10 kV across a 150 µm gap between steel electrodes at < 0.5 Torr can avoid breakdown.
96
To demonstrate functionality, we used SIMION (section 6.3) to simulate motion of 8 nm to
12 nm particles through the focusing system (without Brownian motion; see section 6.3.2.
Our conclusions should be unaffected). Due to software limitations, we simulated the two
quadrupoles separately then merged the results to create the following graphs.
Figure 6.16: Left: nanoparticle radial positions as they are focused while moving toward the
substrate. When entering a quadrupole and before focusing, note the beams briefly expand
(beyond the simulation starting diameters of 0.21 mm and 23 µm from table 6.8) due to radial
velocity and RF heating (section 6.3.3). Right: the same graph with a logarithmic scale.
The Brownian limit is the realistic final beam diameter given by equation 6.6; our simulation
unrealistically does better but would match this if simulating Brownian motion.
Figure 6.17: Axial velocity of particles as they move toward the substrate.
They begin
at the 100 m s−1 to 300 m s−1 we estimate our aerosol nozzle outputs (see chapter 4) but
are quickly slowed down by air drag until DC acceleration plus drag (section 6.4.1) moves
them at constant slow velocity through the quadrupoles. The final acceleration is nearly
instantaneous and lets particles reach 1000 m s−1 to 2000 m s−1 (depending on mass/charge
ratio—this is the chromatic aberration that a linac can improve upon). Finally, particles slow
down slightly due to drag while traversing the gap before hitting the substrate (assuming
0.4 Torr). This could be reduced by minimizing the distance to or pressure at the substrate.
97
These simulations confirm the system works like we expect! In the radial direction, particles
are focused by the first quadrupole, then focused further by the second. The final diameter of
the particle beam is less than 5 µm wide. Axially, particles reach a slow 40 m s−1 drift velocity
as they move through the quadrupoles then are accelerated to over 1000 m s−1. Experimental
confirmation will have to wait, as previously noted, until we have built a nanoparticle charger
(see chapter 5). But a complete nanoparticle printing system should be straightforward to
construct: we simply add our focusing system into our aerosol printer from chapter 4.
Figure 6.18: Left: render (not yet physically built) of what a complete nanoparticle printer
with electrostatic focusing might look like. This is the aerosol printer of chapter 4, but as
proposed in section 6.1, we have moved the aerosol nozzle away from the substrate to add
our proof-of-concept focusing system. The only major missing component is a nanoparticle
charger, which could be included as noted in chapter 5. Right: zoomed-in view.
Implementation Concerns
How can we manufacture the focusing system, given that it has extremely tiny electrodes
and complex electrical waveforms (figure 6.15)? Regarding the mechanical construction, the
smallest quadrupole has electrodes about 100 µm wide. If they are made rectangular instead
of perfectly round (which can work; see appendix A), the electrodes could be traces on
stacked printed circuit boards (PCBs); this works for other ion traps [410][411][408][409][412].
Alternatively, microfabrication MEMS techniques54 can be used to build these electrodes;
this too is somewhat common55 [415][416][417][414][418][419]. A final (amazing) option is to
realize the very device we are designing is capable of printing multimaterial structures at
this size scale: we could use one nanoparticle printer to make parts [420] for another!
As for the electrical circuitry, our challenge is to apply hundred-volt waveforms to elec-
trodes, which act as small capacitors (our quadrupole electrodes are low picofarads while
significantly larger ion traps might have nanofarads of capacitance). The waveforms are
54I (the author) previously built a MEMS device of similar 100x10 mm size for an unrelated project [15].
55This is how the trapped ion quantum computers mentioned in appendix A are built [413][414].
98
sinusoids for the quadrupoles (where frequencies, typically 1 kHz to 10 MHz, depend on trap
geometry and need to be adjusted further to suit different particle mass/charge ratios (sec-
tion 6.3.2 and equation A.6), plus a DC potential (for DC acceleration, section 6.4.1) or
possibly even a sawtooth wave for a linac (section 6.4.2).
Many quadrupoles in the lit-
erature only require a single-frequency sinusoid (“RF” for radio frequency) with DC bias,
which is most easily achieved with a resonant LC circuit to generate RF56 while the DC
bias is provided either by applying the RF to one pair of quadrupole electrodes and the DC
to the other [424] or by combining the DC and RF with capacitive or inductive coupling
[376][357][364][411]. An interesting alternative is to drive quadrupoles with a rectangular
wave with precisely-controlled duty cycle [425][375][426][427]. This is called a digital ion trap.
The electronics (fast high-voltage switches) can be simpler and easier to adjust than an LC
resonator [428][429][430][431][432]. The performance can be comparable to a sinusoid-driven
quadrupole [356][433] though the analysis is slightly more complicated [434][435][436].
For our electronics, because our analysis so far has used sinusoids, we made a preliminary
investigation of circuits to generate adjustable-frequency sinusoids (via arbitrary waveform
generation) in appendix C with promising results. It seems feasible to build cheap circuits
that will generate arbitrary trap frequencies with DC offsets (or linac waveforms), which
may be useful when printing nanoparticles of different sizes and charges. We also discussed
the tens of electrodes that might be required57. See appendix C for more detail.
This is a point worth repeating: by adjusting the trap frequency and DC acceleration voltage,
the same focusing system should be able to handle a range of particle mass/charge ratios (one
at a time). The focusing (equation 6.6) is somewhat independent of particle mass/charge so
long as the frequency (equation A.6) is set correctly. This means we should be able to print
multiple materials sequentially (as we did in chapter 4) without major problems.
Further Improvements
Although we’ve shown a way to print particles at < 5 µm resolution with velocities spread
between 1000 m s−1 to 2000 m s−1, this is not quite as good as the specifications we originally
hoped for in tables 6.1 and 6.3 (namely, < 1 µm resolution and velocities with only ±10%
variation). But we suspect reaching (and exceeding) these specifications is possible.
Improving resolution is most easily done by making a smaller quadrupole (perhaps a third
stage) or raising quadrupole voltage, ultimately limited by equation 6.6 (table 6.4)—which
suggests the theoretical possibility of sub-100 nm resolutions, at which point the finite size
of the nanoparticles starts to be a limit to resolution! It is also possible that an Einzel
lens, though not extremely effective due to chromatic aberration, still helps a small amount
(perhaps we use the accelerating lens to focus slightly). Given how close we are already
(< 5 µm) and the lack of fundamental barriers, we suspect sub-1 µm can be obtained without
56Microfabrication plasma tools rely on similar resonant circuitry to generate RF signals, but typically at
higher voltage and power specifically to generate a plasma via gas breakdown (unlike us) [421][422]. This is
often at 13.56 MHz within an ISM frequency band so legal RF emission regulations are less strict, but some
tools (e.g., pulsed DC sputtering) use lower kilohertz frequencies [423].
57Our example system of figure 6.15 has 256 separate quadrupole electrodes, though since the two diagonals
of a quadrupole are symmetric only 256/2 = 128 separate signals are required.
99
too much more effort (in fact, if layers are printed with a 10:1 width:height aspect ratio as
in chapter 4, we can print sub-micron layer thicknesses already). Reaching 100 nm is more
difficult but surprisingly not out of the question.
We might add other electrostatic manipulation methods. Velocity variance can be reduced58
with a linac. It might be possible to combine the multiple quadrupoles by tapering them if
their different frequencies can be reconciled; tapered non-quadrupole ring geometries exist as
ion funnels [218][412][411][437][432]. We could consider reducing the buffer gas throughout
the focusing system (via differential pumping) to allow higher voltages at its end.
Better computer simulation may help design these improved focusing systems. Our own sim-
ulation neglected Brownian motion, modeled each quadrupole separately, and ignored space
charge. While we think our analysis, which instead relied on analytical approximations, is
generally correct, a better simulation could model the Brownian-dependent output beam
diameter to confirm printing resolution. Even more useful would be computer optimization
of electrode geometry [305][403][401] which can find ways to deform electrodes to improve
performance (tapered quadrupole ends might better capture incoming particles [364]). Fi-
nally, a boundary element method simulation may be more accurate than the finite difference
method SIMION uses [438][439].
In conclusion: it seems likely electrostatic focusing will work well, which means a complete
multimaterial nanoscale printer is feasible! Our proof-of-concept electrostatic focusing sys-
tem already definitively beats aerosol deposition, which cannot simultaneously reach high
resolutions and high speeds, especially for smaller nanoparticles (see section 4.2.1). We are
ready to make some final notes on electrostatic printing in general.
6.5.2
Managing Deposited Charge
There is an issue with electrostatic particle printing we have neglected to mention so far.
When a charged particle is printed on a substrate, because like charges repel, it will deflect
additional particles from being printed there. This will decrease resolution or, in the extreme,
might even prevent new particles from sticking at all, stopping the print.
We know this will be a problem because it occurs elsewhere. This has been studied directly
[290], was used (to beneficial effect) to pattern charged nanoparticles with an insulating mask
[63][68], might occur inside aerosol tubing (chapter 4), and is a known effect in scanning
electron microscopy and lithography where electrons build up on insulating surfaces and
repel further electrons [440], decreasing image resolution (or they attract positively-charged
nanoparticles as xerography [69]). It is also known that in ion traps (like ours), charge tends
to build up on any insulating surface and deflect particle trajectories, so we should build our
focusing system with only conductive exposed surfaces [416][415][441].
The easiest solution would be for the substrate (and the part we are printing) to be conductive
so electrons can move through it to neutralize built-up charge. However, we are very explicitly
58A simple mechanical mechanism [159][152] or electrostatic field (Wien filter) can filter particles by
velocity, but this wastes particles just like an aperture does to improve position resolution.
100
hoping to print electrical circuits, which need insulation between conductors, and MOSFET
transistors, which have charge-sensitive insulators59. We need a more general approach.
The ultimate solution may be to actively neutralize charges60 as they are printed. Reviewing
the charging methods listed in chapter 5, note electrons can be generated61 with field or
thermionic emission then impacted into nanoparticles after focusing and either before or
after collision with the substrate. This is especially elegant as electrons are attracted to the
positively-charged particles. This can occur in the gap between focusing system and substrate
(0.5 mm long in our example system), which can be at sufficiently low pressure to allow
electron travel. This may require careful engineering but seems physically feasible.
6.5.3
Printing Speed Limits
So far we have discussed almost exclusively the problem of moving nanoparticles with high
resolution and velocity so we can make semiconductor devices. But there is another practical
limit: how fast is printing? A slow fabrication process might be uneconomical even if it is
otherwise easier than microfabrication. For example, focused ion beam induced deposition
(FIBID, chapter 1 and section 6.5.4) is so slow that it is used only in rare circumstances.
It is easy to compute a maximum limit on printing speed that depends little on the other
complexities we just discussed (or even electrostatic vs. aerosol focusing).
To calculate a maximum printing speed, the crucial realization is that particles can impact
the substrate at up to a maximum velocity (as according to chapter 3, higher velocities will
vaporize a particle and leave an impact crater instead of the desired deposition), and this
applies a speed limit to everything else.
Figure 6.19: A cartoon illustrating a particles in a beam of diameter dB being printed onto
a substrate. The particles move at velocity va and fill a fraction η of the beam volume.
Consider a focused nanoparticle beam of diameter dB impacting a substrate, which is scanned
in the XY plane to produce a pattern. dB is limited because we want the printer to have
high resolution (for example, printing a 1 µm wide line requires dB ≤1 µm). The particles
59Charges trapped in the gate oxide of a MOSFET during fabrication change its threshold voltage [1].
60For prior art, see [177] which neutralizes argon clusters via diffusion (dis)charging.
61We might use a MEMS electron source to fit in the small gap before the substrate [442][443].
101
travel at velocity va, which chapter 3 suggests is at most 1000 m s−1 to 3000 m s−1. Finally,
particles in the beam62 don’t touch; they fill some fraction of the beam volume for which we
use the variable η (an efficiency). The maximum (η = 1 = 100%) means there is no space
between particles and the beam is a solid cylinder, which doesn’t work, of course. It is not
immediately clear what a reasonable upper bound to η should be63, but if we choose 0.1%,
we can compute a possible upper value for print speed. Calculate the volume of material
printed onto the substrate per unit time, the volumetric flux Q, to be
Q = η va π d2

.
(6.17)
For example, printing with dB = 1 µm resolution, va = 1000 m s−1, and our hypothetical
η = 0.001 deposits Q = 7.9 × 105 µm3/s. If we tried to print an integrated circuit with
10x10x0.01 mm volume64, the total print time is 1273 s = 21 min. Printing with a smaller
100 nm beam is much slower: Q = 7900 µm3/s, so that chip would take 35 hours to print.
Contemporary state-of-the-art CPU, GPU, and memory chips have 10 nm features requiring
another 100x time increase and months per chip, which seems impractical.
But this used a hypothetical value for η. How close to this can we actually get?
We previously calculated two other speed limits we can compare against: the rate we can
produce nanoparticles and the space charge limit to fitting particles in a beam.
In chapter 2 (and confirmed in chapter 4), we found we could make particles at 0.6 mg h−1 to
6 mg h−1, which is a volumetric flux (for copper) of Q = 1.9 × 104 µm3/s to 1.9 × 105 µm3/s,
which is similar to Q with our hypothetical η = 0.001 = 0.1%. We can make slightly faster
nanoparticle sources (e.g., by combining multiple), so it seems nanoparticle generation will
not be a strong limit to print speed65, at least at these small resolutions.
Space charge limits (section 6.3.3) are stricter. Equation 6.9 approximates the number flux
N ′ (particles per second) of particles with charge q that can be contained at velocity va in
beam diameter dB in a quadrupole of voltage VT and radius RT. We can use this to calculate
the volumetric flux limit due to space charge QSC for particles with diameter dp as

(6.18)
This volumetric flux scales with the cube of particle diameter, which is the quantitative
explanation for why using large nanoparticles (and low charge) instead of single atoms as
first described in chapter 2 makes printing faster: we print more atoms per unit charge
62Notice we’re printing many small particles—billions per second—randomly inside a larger beam. This is
because the nanoparticle size (1 nm to 50 nm diameter) is much smaller than the resolution we can place them
with (perhaps 1 µm), but it is also convenient because it allows us to treat the entire process statistically.
This helps when, for example, nanoparticles have some variance in diameter and charge.
63Randomly tightly packed spherical particles fill about η = 64% of a volume [444], but the movement of
particles during focusing probably requires η to be much lower (say, < 1%).
64As noted in chapter 2, this is typical. Chips made with the SkyWater SKY130 130 nm process are 12 µm
of transistors and wiring atop a silicon substrate [139], and most chips are several millimeters on a side.
65This means we can afford to filter nanoparticles to reduce size variation as proposed in chapter 2.
102
(see table 2.1). For a specific value, our example focusing system in section 6.5.1 has (in
the second quadrupole66) dB = 5 µm, VT = 100 V, RT = 50 µm, va = 40 m s−1, q = 10e,
and dp = 10 nm, giving QSC = 45 µm3/s (and η = 5.8 × 10−8). This is very slow: that
10x10x0.01 mm example chip would take two thirds of a year to print! A straight line 5 µm
wide and 500 nm tall would be printed at only 20 µm s−1. This is on the edge of impracticality.
It is immediately apparent that space charge is likely the greatest limit to print speed.
We can increase the speed to reach reasonable rates as follows. First, we could consider using
larger nanoparticles. Since QSC ∝d3
p, doubling nanoparticle diameter to 20 nm gets us 8x
faster speed (though we need to carefully consider drift velocity and the final acceleration
voltage); reducing particle charge q helps but not as much and makes focusing worse. We
can also consider increasing particle velocity through the quadrupoles (perhaps with a linac,
though this makes space charge worse; in a linac particles occupy the same radial distance as
a continuous beam but only in discrete axial bunches), or optimizing quadrupole electrode
radius RT and increasing voltage VT.
(We could also consider neutralizing the space charge (though the complexity means we
will leave it to future work) [445][446][447][448][449] by engineering a situation where free
negative charges coexist in the same area as our positive nanoparticles. This is most common
in particle accelerators where an oppositely-charged background plasma offsets the space
charge of a beam [296]. Alternatively, there has also been work on trapping (appendix A)
and focusing neutral atoms [450][451][452].)
Another promising method is to actively vary the beam diameter dB to print small features
with high resolution but larger features more quickly with lower resolution, much like the
front-end-of-line (FEOL) vs. back-end-of-line (BEOL) divide in microfabricated chips.
Finally, we could consider having multiple focusing systems printing particles in parallel67.
We could fit an array of tens of our example focusing system over a 10x10 mm chip, although
this proportionally increases engineering complexity.
Each of these methods—larger particles, resolution variation, and parallelism—can add an
order of magnitude improvement in speed. Together, we think it is possible to bring the
total realistic volumetric flux back up to at least 5 × 104 µm3/s, which prints our test chip
in 6 hours. This is reasonable and comparable to how long macroscale plastic and metal 3D
printers take to make objects. Still, speed issues will always be significant, and slower speeds
at higher resolutions might limit us to large-feature-size chips (see also section 7.2.2).
Again: speed limits mean we can probably only print simple low-resolution chips,
and each will take hours to days.
66The Child-Langmuir law [296] says particles of mass m and charge q accelerated from rest by a voltage
V across distance L can create a maximum current density J (units A/m2) of J = 4/9 ·
p
2q/m · ϵ0V 3/2/L2.
In our proposed system, this applies to the final accelerating lens but is less strict than radial space charge.
It does not apply to drift motion in the quadrupoles, for which future work should derive a similar relation.
67Massively parallel electron beam lithography systems do exist and are used commercially to make EUV
lithography masks (IMS sells a tool with 262144 separate beams [453]); the company Multibeam is commer-
cializing a multi-column e-beam tool [454]. Multi-beam FIB has been considered but is tricky [455].
103
6.5.4
Is it Possible to Do Better?
Before finishing this chapter, we can check our work against existing electrostatic particle
manipulation systems to help determine whether even faster and higher-resolution printing
might be possible (or to confirm we have started to run against fundamental limits).
First we should compare our methods to focused beam tools, which work on similar principles.
As briefly mentioned in chapter 1, this includes scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), which
use beams of electrons, and focused ion beam (FIB) tools, which use positively-charged single
atoms. Much like we do, these tools create charged particles than focus them with emittance-
limited ion optics to affect a surface. Thorough study has found their resolutions are limited68
usually around 1 nm to 10 nm by emittance, geometrical aberrations (including spherical
aberration and astigmatism), chromatic aberrations, space charge effects, diffraction69, and
system imperfections [296][304][457]. We have already accounted for these for nanoparticles;
our previous analyses appear to be sufficiently complete and we cannot do much better.
To achieve their highest resolutions, FIBs and SEMs use bright (equation 6.3) particle sources
[458][459][456], preferably with low temperature70 (equation 6.11). The majority of FIBs are
somewhat limited in the materials their sources provide: most use a liquid metal ion source
(LMIS) [304][464][465][466] that typically makes a high-velocity beam of gallium ions (Ga+).
This Ga+ beam can etch material or its impact energy can induce material deposition from
a precursor gas that floats around the substrate [457][75][467] (“focused ion beam induced
depsition”, “FIBID” [75] or “FIB-CVD” [467]). This can only print limited materials (mainly
Pt, W, and SiO2, but with Ga and C impurities [75]; not semiconductors). Our quadrupole
setup could be called a high-brightness low-velocity multimaterial nanoparticle source.
Though uncommon, a FIB system can print its ions directly on a surface [468][469], like our
printing but with atoms instead of nanoparticles. This needs a different ion source (e.g., Au
instead of Ga) and the relatively slow impact velocity71 makes it hard to focus [445][470][471].
Several prototypes printed lines of material [471][472][473] (including sub-micron resolution
[470][472] and multimaterial printing [474]) and were explicitly proposed72 for direct-write
microfabrication [473][472][470], but it was concluded that space charge limits meant the
process would be impractically slow [445][475][473] ([473][445][476] suggest print rates of
Q = 1 µm3/s and below). Today, this exists with wide beams as ion beam deposition (IBD)
[477][478], while simpler FIBID (with Ga+) found a niche for sample analysis despite similar
slow speeds [476]. Our nanoparticle printing process is extremely similar to these approaches
but, as shown in section 6.5.3, the use of nanoparticles instead of single atoms lets us print
orders of magnitude faster, which is just barely enough to make the method practical.
We can now place our electrostatic nanoparticle printing method relative to other particle
methods, FIB and aerosol deposition, to find it averages out the pros and cons of both. We
may have found the Pareto-optimal regime for semiconductor device manufacturing.
68These limits can be elegantly graphed as curves on a beam angle vs. area (emittance) plot [313][456].
69Negligible for us; the deBroglie wavelength of a 1000 m s−1 10 nm Cu particle is only 1.4 × 10−16 m.
70Recent work studied laser-cooled ion sources [460][456] or cooled single atoms [80][461][462][463].
71Below about 50 eV ≈10 000 m s−1, since higher velocities etch instead of deposit (see chapter 3).

Table 6.9: The (very approximate) specifications of our proposed electrostatic nanoparticle
printing method compared to direct FIB deposition and aerosol deposition. Of the three,
nanoparticle printing is the only one with resolution, impact velocity (chapter 3), and print
speed (section 6.5.3) simultaneously suitable for semiconductor device fabrication.
This implies we may be close to the limits of not only electrostatic beam focusing but of any
method that prints a beam of particles. And there are other reasons to suspect we can’t do
much better: for example, small particles (adatoms) can move around on the surface after
impact (see chapter 3), making resolution likely at best on the order of 10 nm [43][171]. The
fundamental limit becomes surface chemical reactions73 (driven by kT thermal energy). We
might hypothesize that manufacturing with even smaller resolutions approaching the atomic
scale starts to require either lower temperatures or materials with more precisely arranged
chemical (covalent) bonds, as done in synthetic chemistry and DNA nanotechnology.
To achieve higher manufacturing performance, future work might consider totally different
approaches than particle beams. Standard microfabrication technically counts (though it
has its own limits), or we could combine techniques ([480][481] propose aerosol deposition
followed by FIB milling to increase resolution). More universally, recall that when discussing
nanoparticle manipulation methods in chapter 3, we disregarded direct mechanical/chemical
atomic-scale manipulation due to its complexity which makes engineering difficult. But this
still holds promise74, and if any system eventually supersedes both nanoparticle printing and
microfabrication, this is likely where we would find it.
That is the end of this chapter and our analysis of electrostatic particle manipulation.
It seems electrostatic nanoparticle printing is likely to work. We proposed a concrete design
and are ready to build a working implementation given a nanoparticle charger (chapter 5),
after which many iterative improvements are available to increase performance (particularly
resolution and speed)—and if there’s one thing the microfabrication industry is good at, it’s
progressively improving a technology to its theoretical limits75.
So we now finally have a nanoscale printer as proposed in chapter 1. But is it good enough
to matter? Would this printing process achieve our goals of improving on microfabrication’s
speed, cost, or complexity? We will answer this at last in chapter 7.
73Photolithography also starts hitting limits near 10 nm due to photoresist molecular structure [479].
74This is roughly how biology works (in addition to all chemistry, of course).
75Keeping Moore’s law [6] alive for sixty years by consistently improving photolithography and other
microfabrication tooling to astounding levels is one of humanity’s greatest technical accomplishments.

Chapter 7
Future Work and Implications
We’ve proposed a solution to our original problem: how to manufacture electrical devices
more easily than with microfabrication. We found a new way to print multiple semiconductor
materials by manipulating nanoparticles, and we know how to achieve nanoscale resolution
via electrostatics. But did it work? Did we actually improve upon microfabrication?
7.1
Remaining Steps to Print a Transistor
We should first ask if nanoparticle printing can compare with microfabrication at all, and to
do so we can consider the quintessential microfabricated device: the transistor. Can we print
a transistor? We weren’t quite able to in this dissertation, but we’re probably close.
Recall this dissertation covered many subtopics, each progressing toward our ultimate goal.
To understand this progress, we can draw out what we accomplished and what future steps
are required to make a transistor.
Figure 7.1: A dependency graph of what was accomplished in this dissertation (green, solid)
and what tasks remain (red, dashed) before manufacturing standard semiconductor devices.
106
In the end, we made a number of important nontrivial advances but there are still several
(small) steps left before we can print a transistor, though we think it is achievable.
In chapter 1, we made the simplification that transistors and other devices require multiple
materials, each of precise atomic composition, combined with high 1 µm resolution. With the
hypothesis that printing nanoparticles might achieve these requirements, we experimentally
demonstrated multimaterial printing in chapters 2 and 4. Our use of aerosol focusing limited
both resolution and material properties—chapter 3 suggested higher impact velocities were
needed for materials to have electrically-useful crystalline structures. This inspired chapters 5
and 6, where we proposed an electrostatic focusing mechanism capable of both high < 5 µm
printing resolution and also the high 1000 m s−1 velocity we required with the theoretical
possibility of future improvement. But along the way, we ran into two roadblocks:
• Oxygen: Residual oxygen inside the vacuum chamber stuck to nanoparticles, reacting
with conductors and semiconductors to instead make insulators (e.g., Si became SiO2).
As discussed in section 4.3.3, this is a well-known effect easily solved with a better
(albeit expensive) vacuum chamber.
• Charging: The methods of electrostatically moving particles to high resolution and
velocity that we found in chapter 6 required the particles to be electrically charged. We
were unable to build a UV charger in chapter 5, but it seems likely a future attempt
can succeed; prior art already exists (section 5.4).
These two problems should be solvable with engineering effort. They are not fundamental
limits, merely temporary slowdowns we did not have the time or funding to pursue within
this dissertation. However, as a result of these problems, the most interesting electronic
device we experimentally demonstrated was merely a barely conductive gold trace in section
4.3.3. Printing other conductive metals or semiconductors requires solving the oxidation
issue, and printing materials with useful atomic structures and thus electrical properties
requires solving charging to get high particle impact velocities.
But once these problems are solved, building a transistor might be as simple as printing layers
of doped silicon, insulators, and metal wiring as in figure 1.1. In reality, since the atomic
structure of printed materials varies with deposition conditions, experimentation is likely
required to find what particle velocities and other conditions result in electrical properties
suitable for a transistor—but this seems feasible, given prior art in chapter 3 was able to
build semiconductor ohmic contacts and PN junctions [171][172][47].
We can now put this entire dissertation into perspective: we proposed a single tool, a desktop-
size printer, to (sometimes) replace microfabrication. We are not the first to discuss such a
paradigm—direct-write printing of semiconductors [19] has been proposed many times via
aerosol deposition [60] or FIB [445][473]—but no other method has worked. Our approach
might become the first to simultaneously achieve the high resolution, print speed, and mate-
rial capability needed to make many semiconductor devices. This may be the first complete
roadmap to general-purpose1 nanoscale device manufacturing using similar materials but
methods separate from standard microfabrication. But is this new method useful?
1Not including niche applications such as wide-area printing of polymer solar cells [482].
107
7.2
What if it Works?
Suppose future work follows through with the above roadmap and we obtain a functional
nanoparticle printer that can make semiconductor devices. Does this matter?
Our original motivation for this project was improving on the high difficulty, cost, and time
of microfabrication. While quantifying difficulty is somewhat subjective (though we posit
using only a single tool removes much of the complexity of normal microfabrication), cost
and time are quite computable as follows.
We will find nanoparticle printing might make prototyping of simple semiconductor devices
significantly faster and cheaper, though microfabrication is still easily superior for mass
production or high performance applications (such as computer CPUs and memory).
7.2.1
Cost Comparison
Although money is a very noisy metric, it can give a useful approximation of the overall
difficulty of a manufacturing process, accounting for all materials, equipment, time, energy,
labor, space, and other resources involved. How might the monetary cost of nanoparticle
printing compare to microfabrication?

Table 7.1: Rough estimates for the components of a nanoparticle printer if purchased new.
Actual price may vary significantly. The components in this dissertation were obtained used
for perhaps 10x less, and certain additional components (e.g., a turbopump, loadlock, and
integrated metrology equipment), if added, might increase the price up to 10x.
Both microfabrication and nanoparticle printing have two main costs: the manufacturing
equipment (which is typically very expensive) and the materials the equipment makes chips
out of. The materials are relatively cheap since chips and other semiconductor devices are
physically very small, so in both cases the capital cost of the manufacturing equipment,
amortized over all chips it builds, would be the majority of a single chip’s cost.
108
Nanoparticle printing, unlike microfabrication, uses only a single vacuum chamber and may
be able to do without a cleanroom or postprocessing steps2. The equipment cost is relatively
low: merely the cost of a single printer, which we can estimate by summing its individual
components in table 7.1 as below $100k.
Microfabrication equipment (as per section 1.1) consists of tens of separate tools, kept in a
dust-free cleanroom, and the infrastructure to power them and safely handle large quantities
of chemicals. This is much more complex to set up than a single printer. We can graph
the historical cost of microfabrication fabs to find even minimal fabs3 are multimillion dollar
investments, one or two orders of magnitude more than a nanoparticle printer.
Figure 7.2: Some historical microfabrication fab costs from [9] (diamonds) and [484] (circles).
Higher end fabs became more expensive over time to include tooling for higher perfomance
chips, though they also increased throughput (via larger wafers [9]) so total cost per chip
would not increase too much. The best comparison for nanoparticle printing are the cheapest
earliest fabs at several million dollars—which we have still beat handily.
So if we want a minimal system capable of any semiconductor manufacturing whatsoever, a
nanoparticle printer would be by far the cheapest option to build. But if our goal is to mass
produce large numbers of chips, these results change.
Once the manufacturing equipment exists, we estimated a nanoparticle printer would take
hours to days to print single chips (section 6.5.3), which is hundreds to thousands of chips
per year. A $40k printer cost amortized over several years might result in a cost per chip
of $100 or similar. This only works for chips that are simple or printed with relatively low
resolution; modern CPUs are likely infeasible (see section 7.2.2).
Microfabrication, on the other hand, regularly makes sub-$1 integrated circuits (as well as
hundred-dollar CPUs). Even though a large fab is more expensive, it can make such high
2Annealing or release etch steps may be useful, but we’ll ignore those for simplicity.
3The data of figure 7.2 is subject to selection bias: cheaper fabs are less likely to be tracked. However, we
can estimate the cost of cheap fabs by noting each needs tens of pieces of equipment, each of which is often
in the same $10k–$100k price range as our nanoparticle printer, and thereby reach the same conclusion.
109
quantities of chips that, when amortized, the cost per chip is lower than printing—but only
with a certain extremely important caveat. Microfabrication can only mass produce identical
chips. It makes thousands or millions of copies of the same thing.
Specifically, whenever a microfabrication fab receives a blueprint for a new chip, it must
prepare the fab for that specific design (including making photolithography masks), which
takes nontrivial time and cost (masks can be thousands to millions of dollars, and the first
wafers might be done in weeks to months). It runs the planar fabrication process on hundreds
or thousands of silicon wafers, each of which contains hundreds of chips (see section 1.1).
Each new chip design must pay for the fab preparation plus hundred-chip wafers, so getting
a fab to make only a single chip from that design is inefficient and expensive even if the
original fab equipment costs were already amortized out (compared to printing, which can
easily make each chip unique).
How much are these per-design microfabrication costs? Definitive minimum prices are hard to
come by. Commercial fabs tend to keep information private (fabs often require customers to
sign a nondisclosure agreement covering fab details, for example [485]). Some information is
publicly available from multi-project wafer (MPW) services, which are middleman companies
that combine multiple smaller chip designs together before sending the result to a fab, which
reduces the cost per design and is intended for prototyping. These are generally the cheapest
ways to manufacture a chip in low volumes.

Table 7.2: Approximate minimum cost, time, and availability of some microfabrication fab
processes via MPW services. These numbers are not accurate enough to compare fabs and
are only intended to indicate order-of-magnitude similarities. Each fab process accepts new
designs (“tapeouts”) only several times per year and returns a minimum number of chips at
some cost after some lead time. Data is combined from [486][487][488][489][490] using the
cheapest advertised prices among all MPW services. This does not account for the additional
cost of EDA chip design software, which often far exceeds $100k per year.
We can see the minimum cost to get chips of a new design is in the thousands of dollars,
though this typically provides 10–100 chips, nearing the $100 per chip cost of nanoparticle
printing (making these chips in larger volumes would lower the price further). Note this does
not include difficulties communicating with the fabs (nondisclosure agreements and expensive
design software) or the long lead time required to make chips (discussed in section 7.2.2), but
110
chips are fabricated with minimum feature sizes of 180 nm or below, much better than the
1 µm resolution nanoparticle printing might easily reach, which means the microfabricated
transistors will generally be faster and draw less power.
Using this data and assuming microfabricated chips can cost as little as $1 each when a
million or more are made, we can draw the following approximate graph of the cost required
to make a given number of chips of a new design.
Figure 7.3: Very approximate cost per chip to produce a given quantity of a new chip design,
including amortized equipment capital expenses. The decrease in microfabrication costs is
due to amortizing additional design-specific costs such as mask making. From this figure we
see that nanoparticle printing may be most useful for small quantities of chips (below about
100). Many more advanced fab processes (say, for CPUs) are much more expensive.
It appears nanoparticle printing will likely be cheaper whenever only a low quantity of some
chip design (below about 100) is required; microfabrication becomes cheaper (with higher
chip quality) for higher quantities4. This suggests printing might be suitable for research and
prototyping applications, which typically use only these low chip volumes (and in section
7.2.2 we will see printing lead time is much faster, which is also helpful for prototyping),
as opposed to more generic integrated circuits which are built millions at a time and sold
worldwide over multiple years.
We can also consider different kinds of chips.
Most of our discussion in this section applies to integrated circuits (ICs), which are purely
electrical circuits. Most chips are ICs, and fabs specialize in these by standardizing a certain
sequence of fabrication steps, after which customer designs simply change the arrangement
of transistors made with that standardized process on a chip. But as stated in Chapter 1,
integrated circuits are not the only thing microfabrication makes. Another (albeit smaller)
category is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which are small mechanical devices and
sensors (including inkjet printheads, cell phone RF filters, microphones, and more).
4This is the same effect observed between plastic 3D printing, which makes single parts one at a time, and
plastic injection molding, which has significant setup (mold making) costs but can then produce thousands
of parts more cheaply on average.
111
Although MEMS devices are generally mass-produced and roughly follow the same economics
as ICs, the development of a new MEMS device is much more painful. Microfabrication fabs
that make ICs with a standardized process are reliable, so a chip designer can often simulate
a design then have it made successfully by a fab on only the first or second attempt. On
the other hand, each MEMS device typically uses a different fabrication process (to make
different material layers or make them different thicknesses, for example), so fabs cannot
standardize processes5. Developing a new MEMS device requires both designing the chip and
also completely changing the sequence of microfabrication steps, which can take a dedicated
engineer months of testing due to microfabrication’s complexity (so this also requires physical
access to a fab). The excellent book [491] on MEMS development estimates the cost of a
new MEMS device as follows, and we see nanoparticle printing might again be useful for
prototyping.

Table 7.3: Total cost (tools and labor) and time for developing a MEMS device with stan-
dard microfabrication, copied from [491].
This includes not only the MEMS fabrication
but also chip characterization and testing, and is significantly higher than building an IC.
Nanoparticle printing might be able to replace the proof-of-concept prototype stage.
Finally, we should mention several other ongoing attempts to make microfabrication easier,
cheaper, and faster. Pragmatic Semiconductor [492], InchFab (MEMS) [493], Atomic Semi
[494], and Minimal Fab [495] are all small organizations that appear6 to be building micro-
fabrication fabs while attempting to reduce the equipment capital cost by making smaller
tools7 and reduce the per-design cost and time by using smaller wafers and fewer microfab-
rication steps. We applaud these efforts and look forward to their hopeful success, but it
it is possible that since they still rely on the multiple-tool planar process microfabrication
paradigm, their total improvements will be limited (compared to, for example, the large
turnaround time improvements from nanoparticle printing we discuss in section 7.2.2).
In conclusion, there do indeed seem to be situations in which nanoparticle printing can be
cheaper than microfabrication. This is mainly the case when only a small number of chips
(1–100) of some new design are required, and we should also stress that printed chips will
likely be lower quality than microfabrication, unable to make certain complex chips (e.g.,
computer CPUs). All this suggests printing may be useful for research and prototyping.
5With the notable historic exception of the PolyMUMPs standardized MEMS process, which to the best
of our knowledge was never responsible for a significant fraction of worldwide MEMS fabrication.
6As best as we can determine from publicly available information. These organizations are all relatively
new and might not have settled on a particular commercial strategy yet.
7Several excellent custom-built microfabrication tools proposed for InchFab are [421][422][496].
112
7.2.2
Time Comparison
Besides cost, another important parameter of a manufacturing process is how long it takes.
Here, too, nanoparticle printing and microfabrication differ greatly.
Consider the time after a new chip design has begun manufacturing. Some number of chips
will be made after a certain amount of time (in manufacturing, the number of things made
is typically called the “volume” as in “high volume manufacturing”).
A nanoparticle printer should be straightforward. In section 6.5.3, we calculated one can
probably make several simple chips per day. This can continue indefinitely.
Microfabrication is more complicated: it takes several months to prepare a fab for a new
design and complete the first batch of wafers (from section 7.2.1 and especially table 7.2,
which adds the additional constraint that new designs are only accepted every few months).
Afterward, more wafers can be produced extremely quickly. As noted in section 1.1, a wafer
actually takes weeks to months to be manufactured, but making multiple chips per wafer and
running multiple wafers at different steps in parallel allows a very high total rate. A large
modern fab can produce thousands of wafers per month, each with hundreds of chips.
Figure 7.4: Another way nanoparticle printing significantly differs from microfabrication.
Printing can make a single chip within a day and continue producing chips at a constant
rate.
Microfabrication requires several months to get started, but then (if desired) can
produce large numbers of chips very quickly.
We see a nanoparticle printer might be useful whenever turnaround times of a month or
less are required: in other words, research and prototyping applications8—again! By sheer
fortunate coincidence, nanoparticle printing is doubly beneficial (cost and turnaround time)
for research applications, and the break-even point with microfabrication is once again near
the 100-chip mark. By analogy to macroscopic manufacturing methods (such as 3D printing
and laser cutting, which similarly produce low volumes of parts quickly), this might justify
calling nanoparticle printing a rapid prototyping technique.
8A chip might be manufactured, tested, tweaked, and a new version manufactured, repeating as desired.
113
There is another speed-related effect worth consideration. We have claimed several times
(e.g., section 6.5.3) that nanoparticle printing can only make “simple” chips, not large mod-
ern chips like CPUs, GPUs, and memory. What does that mean, and why is that?
Although all semiconductor devices are made by arranging materials in different 3D patterns
(see chapter 1), some patterns are much more complicated and thus harder to make than
others. A solar cell or LED is just several uniform layers of material, while a computer CPU
has thousands to billions of tiny transistors. Call these “simple” and “complex”.
Figure 7.5: Examples of chip complexity. Top-down images of chips (see figure 1.1) are from
the excellent [497][498][499]. Left: a simple 1.2 mm wide chip with about 25 transistors and
other components (an early 555 timer IC). Right: a complex 10 mm wide chip with about
4500 transistors (the MOS 6502, the CPU of the the Atari 2600, Apple II, Commodore 64,
and other historical computers). The right chip has significantly higher complexity (and
modern computer CPUs, with billions of transistors in the same space, have vastly more).
We might quantify complexity by taking a digital picture (a square grid of pixels) of the chip
and counting how many pixels we needed to accurately describe it. A blank square needs
only one pixel. We could pixelate the left chip of figure 7.5 to a 250x250 pixel grid without
losing fundamental details, but the right chip needs at least 5000x5000 pixels or its tiny wires
blur together. Because chips are actually several layers stacked in 3D, we use the term voxel
(a 3D pixel). The number of voxels in a chip is a way to measure its complexity9.
This finally lets us describe what we mean. Microfabrication cares little about complexity10
because photolithography (section 1.1) makes all features of a 2D layer on a chip at once
in parallel, but nanoparticle printing has to put down each voxel one at a time. In section
6.5.3 we hypothesized a fast nanoparticle printer might print material at up to 5×104 µm3/s
(varying with resolution) with 1 µm resolution, which is (very approximately) 5×104 voxels/s.
This cannot print the trillions of voxels required for a modern CPU in a reasonable amount
of time. Nanoparticle printing is best suited for printing simple chips.
9An improved metric accounting for varying feature sizes might use the size in bits of a compressed image,
i.e., the information entropy. The corresponding manufacturing metric is the information transfer rate to
the substrate. [500][501][502][503][504][505] compare resolution vs. speed of other manufacturing methods.
10As long as photolithography resolution and yield suffice. Incidentally, Moore’s law [6], which is typically
explained as photolithography improvements making more complex chips possible, does not describe simpler
things like solar cells (for which smaller size isn’t an improvement as they need the area to collect sunlight),
or even MEMS, for which more general microfabrication improvements (materials, etc.) matter more.
114
7.2.3
Efficiency and Environmental Impact
Nanoparticle printing might have an additional significant advantage over microfabrication:
extreme space, material, and energy efficiency. For example, a microfabrication fab needs a
warehouse-sized cleanroom with tens of tools while a printer could fit on a desktop.
The nanoparticle printing process requires as input only electricity, an inert gas for particle
flow, and the target materials, and only outputs printed chips, exhaust gas11, and waste heat.
Contrast this to microfabrication [7][8], which in addition to a high power draw requires
photoresist, wet developing and removal chemicals [506][507], hazardous process gases, and
water for wafer cleaning between steps; the output is additional hazardous liquid and gas
byproducts that must be properly cared for12. Of a chip’s entire lifetime, its manufacturing
has the greatest impact to assorted worldwide systems and environments [509][510][511][512],
so improving manufacturing efficiency13 and reducing byproducts is useful.
We quantified printer power consumption by measuring electricity use of our chapter 4 printer
and adding the hypothetical power draw of a nanoparticle charger UV lamp (chapter 5) and
a drive circuit (appendix C) for an electrostatic focusing system.

Table 7.4: Electrical power draw of assorted parts of a nanoparticle printer. The vacuum
pump (high vacuum not included here) draws 60% of the power and the electrode circuitry
is known to be inefficient; future work can likely reduce power use much further.
The total 1300 W power draw of the printer is small enough it can be supplied by a single
standard 120 V 15 A North American NEMA 5-15 mains outlet. It appears we can bring
fabrication energy requirements14 (at least for simple chips) down from the industrial scale
to a desktop tool capable of running in any standard workshop15.
This suggests nanoparticle printing is ideal for distributed onsite manufacturing of chips—
which (yet again!) may make it an excellent fit for research and prototyping.
11Possibly with some nanoparticles, which can be filtered out and the gas fed back to the input.
12Insufficient chemical containment at early Silicon Valley fabs created groundwater contamination and
human health hazards that had to be cleaned up decades later [508].
13An interesting calculation for future work is the theoretical minimum energy required to assemble a chip.
14Though average energy use per chip may be similar to microfabrication, for chips made by which [513]
found a surprisingly constant 1.5 kWh/cm2, about what printing needs for an hour-long print job.
15Or perhaps a space station? Sending a fragile microfabrication fab to orbit would be much harder.
115
7.3
What Printing Can’t Do
We should emphasize: printing will not replace microfabrication (save in very limited
circumstances). If we took our results from this dissertation, built a full nanoparticle printer
(section 7.1) and improved it to its theoretical limits (section 6.5.3), it would not change
the majority of the microfabrication industry, instead assisting only simple and low-volume
research applications. But that does not mean these improvements are unimportant.
Throughout this dissertation, the new nanoparticle printing method we proposed does indeed
seem to be easier, cheaper, and faster than microfabrication in some ways, achieving the goals
we set out to reach in chapter 1. It is easier as measured by complexity and equipment cost,
cheaper in low volumes, and has faster turnaround times.
On the other hand, printing is worse than microfabrication in that it cannot make complex
chips (modern CPUs) and is slower and more expensive for mass production. The majority of
the microfabrication industry is exactly these chips (precisely because mass production lets
this part of the industry scale to high volumes) and would be unchanged by printing.
Printing may be useful in circumstances when low volumes, fast turnaround times, and
simplicity are more important than chip complexity or mass production. Examples include
research and prototyping of new MEMS devices, small analog circuits, and sensors—most
university research, for example, only needs several copies of a given chip. Another promising
possibility is making minimal chips affordable, easy, and fast enough for education: creating
simple chips may be the best way to teach students semiconductor device design.
There may also be times when printing and microfabrication are used together. A printed
chip might be subsequently postprocessed with a microfabrication-style anneal or release etch
(for MEMS), or even combined with techniques like spatial ALD (section 1.2.4) to print more
uniform thin films than nanoparticles can manage by themselves. Likewise, microfabrication
prototyping fabs, where many engineers constantly develop new semiconductor devices, may
benefit from the addition of a nanoparticle printer.
So, while microfabrication will remain the only practical method to make computers in the
forseeable decades, nanoparticle printing may open new avenues of rapid prototyping, finally
increasing the accessibility of semiconductor manufacturing to match its ubiquitous use in
our contemporary world. We think that’s a future worth aiming for.

Appendix A
Ion Traps and Quadrupoles
In chapter 6 we discussed the motion of charged nanoparticles in electric fields in vacuum
then introduced certain static electric fields with useful properties (e.g., Einzel lenses focus
particle beams). But something was missing at first: there was no way1 to force (or “trap”)
a particle to stay still (levitate), even though it sounds like an easy thing to do.
It turns out trapping particles is fundamentally impossible with electric fields that do not
change over time. This is called Earnshaw’s theorem [514]. But as we will shortly discover,
trapping is possible if we allowing electric fields to oscillate with time, and this is widely used
in multiple areas of study [293]. We will introduce these ideas, especially linear quadrupole
traps, so that we can use them in chapter 6 (specifically starting in section 6.3.2).
Figure A.1: An example of Earnshaw’s theorem. Left: consider a positively charged particle
between four infinitely long positively charged circular rods in a 2D plane. Charges repel
each other, so one’s intuition might expect the particle would be trapped in the middle, but
in fact there is always a direction the particle is pushed in until it is far away (middle and
right figures); when centered between the rods it is only in unstable equilibrium. The same
occurs in any arrangement of electrodes/fixed charges (e.g., at the vertices of a tetrahedron).
1At least without tracking the particle and changing the field to compensate, which is often impractical.
151
Earnshaw’s theorem can be quickly proved as follows: consider a time-invariant electric field.
At any location the field satisfies Gauss’s law by having zero divergence (Laplace’s equation),
which means the field is either perfectly flat or has decreasing potential in some direction.
We can avoid Earnshaw’s theorem and levitate particles by allowing the electric field to
change with time2 in a way that uses a particle’s inertia to prevent its escape. To do this
we use the ponderomotive force, which we describe and prove in detail in appendix B.
The ponderomotive force (appendix B) is an emergent effect that occurs as follows. Suppose
a point particle of mass m and charge q at position ⃗x placed in a time-oscillating electric
field of the form ⃗E(t,⃗x) = ⃗E0(⃗x) · cos(ωt). The particle will vibrate back and forth slightly
(“micromotion”) but, on average, will feel a net force
⃗F(⃗x) = −

(A.1)
as long as the oscillation angular frequency ω is sufficiently large (as noted in appendix B,
ω has units rad s−1; most applications use frequency f = ω/2π). That is, the particle will
be moved toward regions of lower electric field magnitude, which is always away from any
electrodes (with varying voltages generating the oscillating field). Furthermore, this average
behavior is conservative, meaning the particle moves as if it is in a potential just like a static
electric field—this is extremely elegant.
Given this trick, our setup of figure A.1 can actually work as we intuitively expect if, instead
of putting each of our four fixed electrodes at a single charge or voltage, we apply the correct
oscillating voltages. Specifically, the lower left and upper right (diagonal) electrodes should
have the same voltage changing sinusoidally with time, and the lower right and upper left
(the other diagonal) need the same voltage but offset 180◦in time—that is, if one diagonal
electrode set has a positive voltage, the other diagonal has a negative, and vice-versa. The
only remaining requirement is the oscillation frequency is above a certain minimum.
A
charged particle now experiences a force toward the center of the electrode array.
These sorts of structures are called “ion traps” as they confine charged particles (including
atomic ions) to a fixed location. Sometimes they are called “RF traps” due to the oscillation
at radio frequencies (kilohertz to megahertz), and sometimes “Paul traps” after Wolfgang
Paul who won the 1989 Physics Nobel [321] with Dehmelt [515] for developing them.
It is easy to make ion traps in many shapes; almost any electrode arrangement can work.
However, the most common [293] ion trap shape is the “quadrupole”, which has four elec-
trodes like we previously considered (albeit ideally hyperbolas instead of circles). Quadrupole
traps are the only ion trap geometry with a tractable exact particle motion equation [293],
are the simplest to build, and also provide the strongest trapping force3.
We will review the full analytical theory of quadrupole traps—which are also what we use
in chapter 6—then make some remarks about other trap geometries.
2Or by other methods, e.g., adding magnetic fields, which we briefly discuss at the end of this appendix.
3See our notes on multipole traps also at the end of this appendix.

Figure A.2: Left: a 2D quadrupole ion trap made by four electrodes (two red, two blue) with
corresponding oscillating voltages. At any one time, two are positive and the other two are
negative. The electrodes are hyperbolas for an ideal quadrupole but can be approximated by
circles [516][517]. We call the distance from trap center to the nearest electrode RT. Some
particles (black line) oscillate but are trapped between the electrodes; others (green line)
move sufficiently far that they hit an electrode and are lost. Center: the average force stably
trapped particles feel is a 2D quadratic potential well; we derive this in equation A.9. Right:
extending this into 3D traps a particle between rod electrodes. The particle can move back
and forth freely with no force or friction.
An ideal 2D quadrupole trap [293][515][321] is made from four hyperbolic electrodes4 placed
together as in figure A.2, fairly similar to figure A.1. Put two electrodes on the x axis and
two on the y; the two x electrodes will always have the same voltage and similar for y. The
distance from the trap center (the coordinate system origin) is RT, and the electrodes are
defined by R2
T = ±(x2 −y2).
To operate the trap, apply oscillating voltage VT cos(ωt)/2 to one pair of electrodes (where
VT is a voltage, ω is an angular frequency, and t is time) and −VT cos(ωt)/2 to the other
(note this means the maximum total voltage difference between electrodes is VT)5. This
generates an electric field ⃗E inside the trap (between the electrodes) of
⃗E(x, y) = −VT

4Since hyperbolas are hard to manufacture, the electrodes can be approximated well with circular elec-
trodes of radius 1.14r0 [516][517][518] with centers at coordinates (R0 + 1.14r0, 0), etc.
5Analysis of quadrupoles sometimes instead uses V0 = VT /2.
153
To analyze particle motion inside the trap, we could directly apply our ponderomotive force
analysis (equation A.1) to equation A.2. We will do so momentarily. However, of all ion
traps the quadrupole is notable in that it is possible to analyze exact particle trajectories
without the ponderomotive approximation [358], so we will do that first.
So consider a particle of mass m and charge q moving x(t) according to the simplified Lorentz
force ⃗F = q ⃗E (see section 6.2) and ⃗F = m⃗a. An examination of equation A.2 reveals the
electric field is independent in the x and y directions—this is why the quadrupole is simple
enough to analyze—so we only have to write the equation of motion in the x direction; the
particle will independently move in the y direction similarly:
d2x
dt2 = −qVT

cos(ωt) x.
(A.4)
This is a Mathieu differential equation; these occur in many areas of physics6. The solution
trajectories (which are generally periodic oscillations) are known [520] but too complex to
write here.
But there is another useful way to analyze a Mathieu system: it turns out
trajectories have one of two behaviors. Either trajectories will remain within some finite
value (are “stable”, i.e., our trapped particle will always stay trapped, close to the origin),
or trajectories will grow until particles exit the trap (as in figure A.2).
To see this stability behavior, we need to rewrite equation A.4 in a standard form. To help,
we will modify our conditions by adding a DC bias V ′
T to the electrodes (the two x electrode
voltages increase by V ′
T/2 and the y decrease by V ′
T/2). We don’t usually want this save in
quadrupole mass spectrometry [359], but it’s useful for illustration. Equation A.4 becomes
d2x
dt2 = −q/(mR2
T) [V ′
T + VT cos(ωt)] · x. This matches the standard [520][521] Mathieu form
d2w
du2 + [am −2qm cos(2u)] w = 0
(A.5)
when w = x, u = t · ω/2, am = (4qV ′
T)/(mR2
Tω2), and qm = (2qVT)/(mR2
Tω2). A thorough
analysis of Mathieu equations [520] shows trajectories are either stable or unstable depending
on the nondimensional parameters am and qm in a surprisingly complex way, which we graph
in figure A.3 (an Ince-Strutt diagram). For our purposes, we mainly care about the case
when V ′
T = 0 and thus am = 0, at which point the particle trajectory is stable when qm < 0.91
(approximately), with little regard for its initial conditions.
Ion traps (and the ponderomotive force in general) only work when the voltage oscillation
frequency ω is sufficiently high (as noted in appendix B); that is the case here. We can
rewrite the Mathieu stability criterion qm < 0.91 to get the minimum angular frequency ω:

6For example, the Mathieu equation describes Kapitza’s pendulum, the effect that an inverted pendulum
can be stable when oscillated vertically [519].
154
Figure A.3: The Ince-Strutt diagram [520][519][359]. The solutions to a Mathieu equation
with parameters am and qm are stable inside the regions shaded gray; otherwise, trajectories
grow to infinity over time. The graph is symmetric about qm = 0. We are mainly concerned
with the region am = 0, for which stability occurs when qm < 0.91 (approximately). This
complexity of this graph is why finding the minimum frequency ω for an ion trap is hard.
This is about as much useful information as we’re going to get out of the Mathieu equation.
Equation A.6 describing the minimum frequency will be very useful (and is more accurate
than our approximation of equation B.14 in appendix B), however, so we will briefly try to
wrap more intuition around it. The frequency is important because, again, once trap geom-
etry and voltage are fixed, the relationship between frequency ω and particle mass/charge
ratio m/q determines whether the particle is stably trapped, and how strongly.
To build intuition, consider the relationship between the minimum frequency ω and the
mass m of the particle (keeping charge q constant for illustration). In the normal case when
the quadrupole electrodes have no DC bias (V ′
T = 0 and am = 0), another way of stating
qm < 0.91 is that all particles above a certain mass will be trapped. Smaller particles will
accelerate too quickly and leave the trap before voltages can oscillate to pull them back.
On the other hand, if some DC bias V ′
T is applied to the electrodes, figure A.3 suggests
there are regions (am < 0)7 where larger particles are unstable. This is because, as particle
size increases for fixed ω, the trap force is weaker and eventually small enough that the
Earnshaw’s theorem effect from the DC bias will move the particle out of the trap.
Quadrupole mass spectrometers work by taking advantage of this Mathieu stability criterion
with combined lowpass and highpass effects [359]. Careful selection of voltages VT and V ′
T
and frequency ω means particles within only a small (adjustable!) range of mass/charge
ratios will be trapped and can be measured8.
7This is asymmetrical because we’re only considering one direction of motion (x or y). When the DC bias
V ′
T is applied to the electrodes, Earnshaw escapes are only in one of these directions; the other is stable.
8In chapter 6 we will want to use parameters (e.g., V ′
T = 0) that trap a wider range of particles, though
we might consider using this effect to filter nanoparticles by size; see chapter 2 for other filter methods.
155
It is probably clear that this exact Mathieu approach to analyzing quadrupole motion is
complicated. Fortunately, we have a much easier way to understand and approximate the
behavior of a quadrupole trap (or any other ion trap, even when the exact solution is un-
available): we apply the aforementioned ponderomotive force (still from appendix B).
Again, the ponderomotive effect is that a particle feels an average force away from strong os-
cillating electric fields. We can apply equation A.1 to equation A.2 to find the ponderomotive
force ⃗F felt by a particle in a quadrupole trap:
⃗F = −
q2V 2

(A.7)
That is, a particle will feel an average force toward the center of the trap (which is why the
trap works). This force is conservative, i.e., it is as if the particle were trapped in a potential
field—the “pseudopotential”—with potential energy eUT (as ⃗F = q ⃗E = −∇eUT)
eUT(r) = q2V 2
T r2
4mω2R4
T
(A.8)
where we have defined r =
p
x2 + y2 as the distance of the particle from the trap center. This
is a radially symmetric 2D quadratic potential well, as shown in figure A.2! The behavior of
a particle is now easy to reason about: if its initial position and kinetic energy are enough to
stay within the well, it will stay trapped, merely oscillating within it over time (with angular
frequency ωqm/
√
8 and amplitude XP). Of course, ponderomotive micromotion is overlaid
on top with frequency ω and, via equation B.5, amplitude qmXP/2.
Finally, suppose we have particles with a range of mass/charge ratios. These can be captured
in the same trap if the frequency is sufficiently high. Find this frequency using equation A.6
for the lightest particles (smallest mass/charge ratio m0/q0). We can combine this with
equation A.8 to rewrite the pseudopotential energy (at that optimal frequency) for any
particle with mass/charge ratio m/q as
eUT(r) ≈qVT r2
8R2
T

(A.9)
which now acts just like a normal electrostatic potential that scales with charge and voltage.
Particles with m/q > m0/q0 will see proportionally smaller potential energies, and particles
with m/q < m0/q0 escape the trap and are lost (by construction). This equation will be
useful for us given the wide range of nanoparticle sizes we expect to use.
All this is enough to design the ion optics we use in chapter 6. We are done with analysis,
though there are other minor effects we will discuss when relevant (e.g., the micromotion
of the ponderomotive force can make it difficult to bring particle positions and velocities to
exactly zero at the trap center, an effect called RF heating we bring up in section 6.3.3).
However, we think it is worth briefly mentioning alternative traps beyond quadrupoles.
156
RF ion traps are easy to design: simply place an oscillating9 electric field between electrodes,
and particles are trapped at regions of minimum electric field (“RF nulls”). This simplicity
has allowed ion traps to find use in many subjects. Besides their use in mass spectrometry
as quadrupoles [358] and related shapes (e.g., Kingdon trap geometries [522]), ion traps can
be used in particle accelerators (see section 6.3.2) or trapped-ion quantum computing, in
which ions are cooled to their quantum ground state (which requires careful study of noise
[366]). This also uses a clever trick: the trap electrodes can all be placed on the same surface
(a planar ion trap [395][396][523][413][409]), making it easy to microfabricate complex traps
with multiple sections that particles can be moved between [416], though the trap depth is
about 100x lower than a quadrupole of similar dimensions and voltage [524][525].
Figure A.4: Left: some other RF ion trap geometries, from [366]. The same quadrupole
potential can be rotated to trap a particle at a point, or the electrodes can be a different
shape. The electrodes can even be placed on a single planar surface, forming a particle trap
just above it. Right: top view of a 5 mm wide planar ion trap separated into many segments
demonstrating techniques for future trapped-ion quantum computers. Atomic ions could be
levitated and moved around these tracks or through the three-way junctions [396].
Given the huge design space, it is worthwhile to ask if there are optimal trap shapes. One
way to analyze this is to realize that no matter the electrode geometry, the potential at the
center of a trap can be written as a multipole expansion: a linear combination of dipole,
quadrupole, hexapole, and higher-order fields. The quadrupole field has the steepest center
(which is what we want in chapter 6, so we use quadrupole electrodes10).
Higher-order
“multipoles”, made with 6, 8, or other even numbers of electrodes, have a steeper edges and
a flatter trap center, which can be useful if low RF heating is preferable at the expense of
position resolution or for trapping multiple ions of significantly different masses [293].
It is also possible to build traps with magnetic fields. A “Penning trap” confines charged
particles with only a DC electrostatic and magnetic field [321]. If a particle has a magnetic
moment it can be trapped by certain magnetic fields even if it has no electric charge [321].
Microfabricated magnetic traps exist [526], and sufficiently good magnetic traps are used to
store antimatter [527][528][529].
In short: electromagnetic particle traps have significant variety.
9It is also possible to use square waves instead of sinusoids; see digital ion traps in section 6.5.1.
10Using concave arc electrodes instead of convex hyperbolas or circular rods can give a slightly higher
quadrupole component plus higher-order multipole factors with the same trap radius and voltage [355].

Appendix B
The Ponderomotive Force
In this appendix we derive and explain the ponderomotive force, which is the effect that a
charged mass placed into an oscillating electric field feels an average force in the direction of
lower electric field magnitude. This is a fundamental part of RF ion traps.
Specifically, we will see that a point particle of mass m and charge q at position ⃗x placed
in a time-oscillating electric field of the form ⃗E(t,⃗x) = ⃗E0(⃗x) · cos(ωt) experiences the time-
averaged (for time periods much larger than 1/ω) net force
⃗F(⃗x) = −
q2
4mω2∇

| ⃗E0(⃗x)|2
.
(B.1)
This effect is elegant and notable as follows:
• Because this force is the gradient of a continuous function (namely,
q2
4mω2| ⃗E0(⃗x)|2),
it is conservative, and that function acts like a potential energy function, exactly
analogous to the regular Lorentz force being conservative for a static electric potential.
Incidentally, we call this potential of the ponderomotive force the “pseudopotential”.
The behavior of particles under a ponderomotive force is easily intuited by imagining
classical motion through the potential energy landscape of the pseudopotential.
• By electric field superposition, this oscillating electric field may be combined with
additional DC and AC fields and their effect on particle motion evaluated separately
as if there were no difference between an electrostatic potential and pseudopotential.
• The ponderomotive force acts equally (as a time-averaged force) on negatively and
positively charged particles.
• The ponderomotive force is not subject to Earnshaw’s theorem and thus allows simple
stable electrostatic levitation (as used in ion traps).
• The ponderomotive force is stronger at slower oscillation frequencies ω. However, this
also causes stronger unwanted particle movements (which we call “micromotion”) and
for any given application there is a limit beyond which the micromotion becomes too
large. Thus there is usually a finite optimal value for ω.
158
We will first attempt to build an intuition for how the ponderomotive force works by consid-
ering one-dimensional motion of a particle in an electric field as in the following figure:
Figure B.1: A figure to guide ponderomotive force intuition.
The electric field, shown in yellow, oscillates sinusoidally with time and always has increasing
magnitude toward the right-hand side of this one-dimensional world.
Consider the motion of a positively charged particle (the red circle) in this field. At time
t = 0, the electric field points to the right, and so the particle begins to move in that
direction. At t = 1, this is reversed, so the particle slows and then starts moving to the left
instead. Repeat over time, and the particle oscillates around its average position. This is
the “micromotion” mentioned earlier.
If the electric field had constant magnitude everywhere, this is all that would happen. How-
ever, the electric field is stronger to the right and, importantly, the particle oscillation is in
phase with the electric field. In the 50% of the time the particle is further to the right of its
average position, the stronger electric field there is pointing toward the left, and in the half
of the time the particle is to the left, the electric field points to the right but is weaker. As
a result, there is a force imbalance: the particle experiences slightly more force toward the
left, and slowly moves, on average, in that direction. This is the ponderomotive force.
Now let’s formalize this.
Consider a particle of mass m in a 1D rapidly oscillating force field qE0(x) cos(ωt), where
qE0(x) is the force on the particle at position x, t is time, and ω is angular frequency (note
many engineering applications prefer a frequency f with ω = 2πf).
Assume the particle motion x(t) has slow/large (ponderomotive, also called “secular”, move-
ment) and fast/small (micromotion) components xs(t) and xf(t), respectively:
x(t) = xs(t) + xf(t).
(B.2)
159
Our goal is to find xs(t). From F = qE0(x) cos(ωt) = ma, we can find a = d2x
dt2 :
d2x
dt2 = d2xs
dt2 + d2xf
dt2 = qE0(xs + xf)
m
cos(ωt).
(B.3)
We will first approximate xf(t) as follows. Assume qE0(xs + xf) ≈qE0(xs), i.e., the mi-
cromotion oscillation amplitude is small compared to the distance over which the electric
field varies, and further assume the micromotion is significantly faster than ponderomotive
movement so we can consider a short amount of time in which d2xs
dt2 ≈0 but d2xf
dt2 > 0. Then
at any given such moment,
d2xf
dt2 ≈qE0(xs) cos(ωt)
m
(B.4)
and
xf(t) ≈−qE0(xs) cos(ωt)
mω2
.
(B.5)
We see the fast micromotion xf(t) is periodic with amplitude proportional to force, as we
would intuitively expect. Calculation of xs(t), the net movement due to ponderomotive force,
is more involved because we now have to consider variation in E0(x) combined with xf(t).
Start again from equation B.3, but this time approximate the electric field E0(x) as varying
linearly around xs:

dt2 ≈1

(B.8)
Note we were able to combine the cos(ωt) frequency of micromotion with the cos(ωt) fre-
quency of electric field variation to get a factor of cos2(ωt). We can average this out over
time (cos2(ωt) →1/2) to find

| ⃗E0(⃗xs)|2

(B.11)
This force, as previously mentioned, is the gradient of a scalar function which can be treated
as a potential energy U where ⃗F = −∇U. This pseudopotential is
U(⃗xs) ≈
q2
4mω2| ⃗E0(⃗xs)|2.
(B.12)
Now recall our derivation assumed the micromotion is small, which holds so long as the field
oscillation frequency ω is sufficiently high. What is the minimum value of ω that works?
A general calculation of the precise minimum frequency ωmin is nontrivial [293] (for an
example, see the Mathieu stability criterion for quadrupole electrodes in Appendix A), but
we can approximate it1 as follows. Suppose we want the peak-to-peak micromotion amplitude
to be less than some distance L (for example, the distance between electrodes generating the
electric field). Then, using equation B.5, we can write
L ≈2qE0
mω2
min

(B.13)
or
ωmin ≈
r
2qE0
mL .
(B.14)
This equation is limited because it assumes a constant electric field magnitude E0 when, by
premise, the electric field will have varying magnitude. However, setting E0 to the average
or maximum electric field observed over the area of L should suffice for approximating
micromotion amplitude to within an order of magnitude, and this can be refined later with
numerical simulation. Defining fmin = ωmin/2π, our nanoparticle ion traps typically2 have
1 kHz < fmin < 1 MHz.
Finally, a historical note: the basic derivation here is well-known and was used while develop-
ing the first ion traps and mass spectrometers, e.g., by Dehmelt [515]. Also, the fundamental
physics holds not just for electric fields but for any force field [530].
1For discussion and comparison of several other methods to approximate where motion is stable, see [293],
which prefers the conservative criterion ωmin ≈sqrt((2q|∇⃗E0|)/(0.3m)) with the same dimensions as ours.

Appendix C
High Voltage Waveform Generator
In chapter 6, we discovered that some methods of electrostatically focusing nanoparticles
need a complicated voltage waveform applied to each of tens of electrodes (a segmented
quadrupole). Although there were some alternative electrode geometries with simpler wave-
form requirements, these complex setups were easier to analyze and might sometimes give
superior results. In this appendix, we build a proof-of-concept circuit to show creating these
waveforms (and thus our complicated focusing mechanisms) would be feasible1.
Figure C.1: Left: an example 17-segment quadrupole (section 6.4.1), where each of 17∗2 = 34
electrode pairs needs a waveform consisting of a sine wave (with adjustable frequency ω) plus
DC bias ψ. Right: one of the more extreme possibilities is to replace the DC bias with a
sawtooth wave to make this into a linac (section 6.4.2), giving the displayed waveform.
We require a circuit that can achieve the following:
• Create a time-varying voltage with up to 200 V amplitude (limited by gas breakdown),
preferably ±100 V centered around zero (so particles don’t feel a net force toward the
outer vacuum chamber, which is grounded).
1As noted in chapter 6, we didn’t physically build a complete electrostatic particle manipulation system
because we lacked a working nanoparticle charger from chapter 5, but we should be able to in the future.
162
• This voltage needs to have a sinusoidal component to drive a quadrupole with a fre-
quency 1 kHz to at least 1 MHz (table 6.4) adjustable in real time to handle particles of
different mass/charge ratios. It should also be able to add a DC bias (again adjustable)
and, if we need to build a linac, also superimpose a sawtooth wave (with maximum
frequency component 1 kHz to 1 MHz defining the linac velocity).
• The voltage needs to be applied to metal electrodes in a vacuum chamber, which
generally act as small capacitors probably in the 10 pF range. The possibility of gas
breakdown suggests the circuit should tolerate temporary output short circuits.
• And since the waveforms on any two electrodes may not correlate (especially with both
quadrupole and linac), we need an individual waveform for each of tens of electrodes.
This circuit is rather difficult to build due to the combination of high 1 MHz frequency and
high 200 V voltage, let alone the requirement it be adjustable in real time with nonsinusoidal
components (a DC bias or sawtooth wave) or the need to create tens of similar waveforms.
The only simplifying factors are that the load is very small (10 pF) and simulations suggested
high voltage output resolution is not necessary (5 bits = 32 voltage levels is more than enough;
see also digital ion traps in section 6.5.1).
Again, there may be simpler ways to build a particle focusing system (see section 6.5.1 for
thoughts on different electrodes, waveforms, and circuits), but if we can build a circuit that
satisfies our complex requirements here, it would also suffice to power any simpler mechanism
we want, so we decided to proceed.
This circuit is a high voltage and frequency arbitrary waveform generator. These do already
exist for several purposes, but no existing solution is perfect for us. Available opamps cannot
simultaneously output the high voltages and frequencies we require. Examples include the
ADHV4702 [531], OPA462 [532], and HV264 [533], which can respectively reach ±110 V,
±90 V, and 215 V, but only up to about 10 kHz to 30 kHz. Driver circuits for piezoelectric
or ultrasound actuators (which are also small capacitive loads) also achieve our voltage
specifications but only up to low kilohertz frequencies [534][535][536]. Speeds > 10 MHz
are possible when constructed via custom integrated circuits [537][538], but this is generally
not feasible given the cost of custom ICs (see chapter 7)2.
Other amplifiers built from
discrete components can reach 500 V at 5 MHz [539][540], but the required circuits are fairly
complicated and sometimes use specialized components (e.g., vacuum tubes [539]). Off-the-
shelf amplifiers capable of ±150 V signals from DC to 5 MHz are available from [541], but at
$2500 each, tens of these cost more than the rest of a nanoparticle printer combined.
This prior art suggests our circuit is possible but difficult to build. To demonstrate it could
be cheap enough while driving tens of electrodes, we will have to design our own.
Safety note: These circuits can use somewhat high voltages and somewhat high power,
enough to potentially cause electrical injuries. Caution was taken during assembling and
testing. We ran only minimal experiments with loose cables to show basic functionality;
further development would warrant building a robust enclosure for the system.
2The point of this dissertation is making such custom integrated circuits feasible; it might someday be.

A class-A amplifier (“output”) amplifies an incoming signal shifted to the low supply rail
(“level shifter”). A “voltage compensate” circuit allows the high supply rail voltage to vary
without affecting output gain. Resistors R2 and R3 calibrate the output DC bias and gain.

To demonstrate how a system with tens of output waveforms might be built, we chose an
architecture where a single FPGA would provide signals to drive tens of boards (figure C.2),
each containing a DAC and high voltage amplifier. The amplifier circuit was as shown in
figure C.2. We chose a class A amplifier circuit topology as (though inefficient3) it is simple,
predictable, and can be built from a single off-the-shelf high voltage NMOS MOSFET. To
create a bipolar signal, we floated the class A amplifier to a negative voltage supply rail
(< −100 V), then used current to transfer the input signal from near ground to the negative
voltage rail4. Finally, a voltage compensation circuit adjusted the bias and gain to make
the output independent to the high rail voltage. All power rails were provided from external
supplies and shared between boards to reduce size, cost, and inefficiency.
We designed a PCB with a serial data circuit, DAC, and the high voltage amplifier5. These
boards were designed to be daisy-chained together and arrayed en masse in a single enclo-
sure (see figure C.3), where the class-A amplifier MOSFETs and power resistors could be
attached to a heatsink if desired. We built and tested two of these PCBs (figure C.3) and
confirmed their basic functionality. All circuit components are off-the-shelf, cheap, and have
high availability. The total part and assembly cost of a single board is about $25 (two orders
of magnitude less than the previously-mentioned off-the-shelf amplifier [541]), making an
array of tens of electrodes economically feasible. Finally, we confirmed our system could
generate high voltage high frequency6 signals by connecting an Agilent 33210A signal gen-
erator (providing a ±1 V (2 Vpp) wave) to a high voltage amplifier (bypassing the DAC for
simplicity) and generating the frequency response plot in figure C.4.

We can conclude it seems possible to affordably construct a high voltage, high frequency,
multi-output signal generator that meets our requirements, and constructing the full system
can be done when ready for experimental tests. Driving circuitry is likely not the limit to
nanoparticle printer feasibility.
3A single amplifier drew up to 10 W; efficiency (vs. CV 2f capacitor power draw) varied ≈0.01% to 10%.
4We chose not to use feedback from the amplifier output to input to avoid phase delay problems.
5This could be simplified by putting all electronics on a smaller board, possibly inside the vacuum chamber
to minimize parasitic capacitive load [424], or ultimately on a custom integrated circuit [542].
6Higher frequencies are achievable by decreasing the value of power resistor R5 in figure C.2.
