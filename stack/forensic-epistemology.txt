What is the purpose of a null-wavefront in Null Convention Logic?



Assistant:

In Null Convention Logic, a null-wavefront refers to a timing signal that indicates the absence of any data activity. The
purpose of a null-wavefront is to provide a reference point for synchronization and timing within the system. By using
null-wavefronts, the system can ensure that data is transmitted and processed correctly, even when there is no actual data
present.

In essence, null-wavefronts help to maintain the integrity and reliability of the communication process in Null Convention
Logic by allowing for precise timing and synchronization of data signals.

Introduction This book is primarily concerned with delineating certain salient epistemological features of belief. Beliefs are
generally distinguished from other cognitive states by possessing certain epistemic traits. When we ascribe beliefs and
desires to a certain creature, we are, in effect, trying to make rational sense of its doings. Rationality and coherence are
thus of the essence of belief. It has, however, been claimed that these epistemic characteristics of belief are not only
threatened by internal incoherence but also by certain widely shared views in recent philosophical thought. This book aims at
challenging such claims by providing an in-depth analysis of some of these distinctive features of belief and their
consequences. My principle objective is to provide a re-examination of the epistemic features of belief and show how they can
be consistent with some of the widely held views in philosophy, yielding, in the end, a unified and coherent picture of the
epistemology of belief. Belief is generally thought to be the primary cognitive state representing the world as being in a
certain way, regulating our behavior and guiding us around the world. It functions, in Ramsey’s word, like a map by which we
steer. It has a representational content that is deemed correct or true in case its content matches what it is intended to
represent. In addition to having a particular propositional content, beliefs stand in various psychological relations to an
agent’s other beliefs, to his non-doxastic psychological states and to actions he imitates. There are, however, certain
salient epistemic features of belief that render it a distinctive cognitive state. These include, first and foremost, its
commitment to the truth of the proposition that constitutes its content. Unless one has grasped that truth bears this
constitutive relation to belief, they will not have grasped the meaning of “belief.” Beliefs are also distinguished by the
fact that they are sensitive to evidence. The reasonableness or warrant of belief, thus, hinges on its possession of adequate
grounds. Of particular importance is the rationality of perceptual beliefs that are governed by evidential norms in the sense
that a rational perceptual belief is one that is supported by sensory evidence. The immediate question is how, as in certain
epistemological theories, one can appeal to sensory experiences to give an account of the justification of perceptual beliefs.
Another pertinent question concerns the nature of the relation which justified that beliefs stand in with their
justification-conferring grounds. This is the problem of the basing relation where the existing attempts at explicating what
it is for justified beliefs to be based on their grounds have all been unsatisfying for some reason or another. Assuming that
perceptual experiences are able to justify the beliefs they cause, on a prominent theory of the structure of justification,
the ensuing justified beliefs, called “basic” beliefs, are then standardly taken to constitute the foundation of an agent’s
belief system. Given certain plausible assumptions, these basic beliefs give rise to the idea that has come to be known as the
basic knowledge thesis. It has been argued recently that such a position falls victim to the so-called problem of easy
knowledge, the idea that, on such theories, certain inferences, involving closure and bootstrapping, allow us far too easily
to acquire knowledge (justification) that seems unlikely under the envisaged circumstances. It has further been claimed that
certain closure inferences involving basic knowledge are actually instances of the failure of transmission of warrant across
entailment. What has added to the interest in these problems is the claim (made by some philosophers) that answering these
questions would enable us to explain our felt dissatisfaction with Moore’s famous “proof” of the external world and arguments
that purportedly share a similar structure. Basic beliefs are also said to be fallible in that holding a belief attitude
towards a relevant proposition does not entail that the proposition in question is true. There is also the fact that we seem
to be good at finding out about our beliefs. Such knowledge seems to be direct and immediate in the sense that there is no
other thing that one needs to know or observe from which one can infer that one is holding the beliefs in question. There is,
of course, a question mark hanging over the extent to which knowledge of our beliefs is direct and immediate or our ordinary
practices of ascribing beliefs are fallible – especially in the light of the recent externalist theories of content. To tackle
these issues, I begin by looking at the thesis that, unlike other cognitive states, beliefs are constitutively linked with the
truth of their contents. This feature of belief has been famously captured in the thesis that believing is a purposive state
aiming at truth. It has however proved to be notoriously difficult to explain what the thesis really involves. The first three
chapters deal with the truth-directedness or truth-sensitivity of belief, its consequences and the problems it gives rise to.
The first chapter critically examines a number of recent attempts to unpack the metaphor that beliefs aim at truth. I shall
highlight an important distinction between, what I call, the doxastic and epistemic goals and then proceed to illustrate how
some of the recent accounts of the aim-of-belief thesis have failed to respect this distinction. Finally, I shall propose my
own story of what the thesis involves while emphasizing its deflationary nature. The bulk of the second chapter is taken up
with seeing how the truth-directed nature of belief gives rise to the so-called Moore’s paradoxes. Despite differing over
details, all the attempted resolutions of Moore’s paradox tend to see the absurdity of Moorean sentences as eventually
stemming, one way or another, from the violation of the law of non-contradiction. While some philosophers construe the problem
with such sentences as involving some sort of pragmatic contradiction arising from their assertion, others seek to locate the
source of paradox in the alleged fact that such sentences cannot consistently be believed. Still others seem to think that
what gives rise to the paradox is the violation of certain necessary conditions of epistemic justification. In this chapter I
shall try to uncover a common pattern among all this diversity, and show how these disparate approaches to the paradox appeal
to analogous strategies to resolve it. They are subsequently criticized by calling into question the principles they help
themselves with to tackle the problem. Finally, I shall propose my own solution of the paradox according to which Moorean
sentences are defective not because of some associated logical impropriety but because their assertion violates a certain
interpretive constraint, namely the principle of charity, on an adequate theory of meaning. What these findings indicate about
the nature of belief is that when we ascribe beliefs and desires to a certain creature, we are, in effect, trying to make
rational sense of its doings. These results square nicely with the account developed in Chapter 1. Next, to develop further
the theses propounded with regard to the truth-directed character of belief, I turn (in Chapter 3) to two competing
requirements for knowledge, namely sensitivity and safety. Both requirements have been subjected to a variety of Gettier-type
examples for and against them. While focusing mostly on safety, I shall try to evaluate these criticisms by putting a new
gloss on these principles. It will be claimed that epistemologists have lost sight of their real significance by construing
them standardly as conditions on knowledge which has, in turn, given rise to the appearance of yet another series of
Gettiertype examples for and against them. These principles, it will be argued, should be seen as giving expression to
distinct cognitive goals for beliefs rather than stating requirements for knowledge. The consequences of seeing them as such
are subsequently investigated in the light of the results of the first chapter. The sensitivity of belief to experiential
evidence, its consequences and the problems it poses are taken up in the next four chapters. In Chapters 4 and 5, an attempt
is made to see how sensory experiences can confer justification on the beliefs they give rise to. Some theorists have claimed
that nothing can count as a reason for a belief except another belief. Experiences do stand in causal relations to beliefs but
this relation is not justificatory and reason-giving. This raises the question of non-doxastic justification, namely, the
question of how causes of such nature can furnish grounds for the beliefs they give rise to. In Chapter 4, after highlighting
the urgency of the issue, I try to provide a rather comprehensive survey of the current attempts to resolve the problem by
reconstructing them as attempts to find a normative paradigm that would simulate the experience–belief transition. While
finding them all wanting, I end by providing a diagnosis of why they fail.

In Chapter 5, I seek out a radically different solution to the problem of non-doxastic justification. To emphasize why a
successful resolution of the problem requires a radical departure from the well-trodden paths, I look at another popular
attempt at resolving the problem which appeals to the thesis of epistemic supervenience, namely, the view that epistemic
properties supervene on non-epistemic, non-normative properties. I begin by critically examining the viability of the thesis
of epistemic supervenience before setting out to explore and ultimately reject the claim that the thesis in question has the
resources to resolve the problem of non-doxastic justification. I shall then suggest an account that places the
experience–belief transition in a semantic context, thus giving rise to a notion of normativity that is manifestly
content-sensitive. To this end, I appeal to a version of the functionalrole-semantics (FRS) account of the content (meaning)
of belief states. The explanation has the virtue of epistemizing semantic normativity, thus allowing us to see how beliefs
resulting from sensory states can be justified. Chapter 6 deals with another feature of the evidential sensitivity of
perceptual beliefs to evidence, namely, the problem of the basing relation. While a justified perceptual belief is one where
an agent’s belief is said to be based on adequate perceptual grounds, no satisfactory analysis of the basing relation has been
forthcoming. To set the stage for discussion, I begin by evaluating two major trends in the basing relation debate, namely the
causal and doxastic theories. I shall focus, however, on causal theories as it is widely believed that some version of the
causal theory must be true. The main obstacle on the way of providing such a theory is to accommodate the problem of deviant
causal chains. After examining one recent prominent solution to this problem, I propose a version of the causal theory of the
basing relation within a Davidsonian framework. In Chapter 7, I shall try to deal with some of the consequences of the theses
developed in Chapters 4 and 5, especially the thought that basic beliefs are justified by experiences that cause them. On some
very plausible assumptions, this leads to the doctrine of basic knowledge, namely knowledge that an agent acquires from a
certain source, even if he fails to know that the source is reliable. It has been claimed that, on such theories,
bootstrapping and closure allow us far too easily to acquire knowledge (justification) that seems unlikely under the envisaged
circumstances. Some philosophers have responded by claiming that closure arguments exploiting basic knowledge are not
warrant-transmitting. In this chapter, I begin by examining different approaches to this issue before spelling out my own take
on it. It will be claimed that, contrary to the received view, basic knowledge inferences are by no means epistemically
uniform. A different account of transmission failure is proposed to explain why some of these arguments fail to transmit
warrant and why others, despite being legitimate, strike us as unsatisfactory. Chapter 8 focuses on the purported fallibility
of basic beliefs. Although most contemporary theories of knowledge and justified belief claim to be fallibilist, they have had
a hard time accommodating knowledge of necessary truths. This has proved to be a daunting task, not least because there is as
yet no consensus on how the fallible/infallible divide is to be understood. In this chapter, after criticizing a number of
recent accounts of fallible knowledge, I argue that the problems stem from the very coherence of that notion. It will then be
claimed that the fallible/infallible divide in the domain of knowledge is best understood in terms of the
externalist/internalist conceptions of knowledge (justification). I end by highlighting some of the consequences of the thesis
which include, among other things, its surprising bearing on the recent controversy over the question whether internalism in
the theory of justification is compatible with externalism in the theory of content. In Chapter 9, I examine another epistemic
feature of beliefs, that is, the epistemic significance of our knowledge of their contents. Recent discussions of externalism
about mental content have been dominated by the question whether it undermines the intuitively plausible idea that we have
direct knowledge of the contents of our thoughts. There have been two lines of argument in support of this claim. The first,
mainly epistemological, argument exploits the so-called “slow switching” cases to argue that, if externalism is true, one
could discover the contents of one’s thoughts only after investigating the physical and/or social environment in which one
exists. The second line of argument, due to McKinsey, draws attention to the absurd consequence of there being a non-empirical
route to knowledge of empirical facts that seems to follow from the combined theses of externalism and privileged access. In
this chapter, I specifically deal with the first line of argument. After examining various responses that have been made to
the switching argument and finding them wanting, I set out to explain why it fails. It will be suggested that the argument
trades on an ambiguity when claiming that our knowledge of our thoughts is susceptible to empirical contingencies. I shall try
to show that it is only by relying on certain controversial assumptions about the concepts of justification and a priority
that this claim, however construed, can stand a chance of establishing the incompatibility of privileged self-knowledge and
externalism. Finally, drawing on an analogy with Benacerraf’s argument against Platonism, I will offer some reasons as to why
the switching argument fails to show that content externalism undermines our privileged knowledge of the contents of our
belief states. Having provided analyses of some of the main epistemological characteristics of belief in the preceding
chapters, our conclusions combine to paint a coherent picture of the epistemology of belief, one that is particularly in
harmony with some of the widely held theses in contemporary philosophical thought. Belief is the paradigm propositional
attitude one of whose salient features is the way it is used to regulate our actions and guide us around the world. It
functions, in Ramsey’s word, like a map by which we steer. It has a content representing the world as being a certain way, and
it is deemed correct or true in case its representational content matches what it is intended to represent. To believe
something is to represent it as true. The representationality of belief is, thus, connected with its intentionality. Because a
belief is about something, it represents it. Accordingly, what seems to be distinctive of the belief mode (as an attitude) is
its constitutive link with the truth of its content. Adopting an attitude of believing toward a proposition seems to carry
with it some sort of commitment toward the truth of that proposition. It is this distinctive feature of belief that is
generally thought to be responsible for the puzzling situation that ensues following the assertion of a Moorean sentence like
“I believe that p, but not-p.” Bernard Williams famously described this feature of belief in the form of the thesis that
beliefs aim at truth (Williams 1973). He thought that the thesis explains a number of distinct characteristics of belief, for
example, the so-called “normativity” of content, the idea that correct beliefs are true beliefs while false ones are those
that are defective in some sense and ought to be avoided (call this the “norm of correctness”); the fact that beliefs seem to
be governed by evidential norms in the sense that a rational belief is one that is supported by evidence; and, finally, the
idea that we seem unable to form beliefs at will (the thesis of doxastic involuntarism). Furthermore, the aim-of-belief thesis
is invoked in order to distinguish beliefs from other cognitive states such as assuming, supposing or (propositional)
imagining. Despite the intuitive plausibility of the thesis, it has proved to be notoriously difficult to explain what is
actually intended by it. In this chapter, I begin by critically evaluating a number of recent attempts at unpacking the
metaphor. In Section 1.2, I try to highlight an important distinction between, what I call, the doxastic and epistemic goals
and then proceed to illustrate how some of the recent accounts of the aim-of-belief thesis have failed to respect this
distinction. Finally, I shall propose my own story of what the thesis involves while emphasizing its deflationary nature. I
end by contrasting it with two prominent (inflationary) theories of the nature of belief. 1.1 Unpacking the metaphor: a survey
and critique There have been a number of attempts to interpret the metaphor that beliefs aim at truth. In this section, I
shall focus on some recent treatments of the issue and seek to show that they all fail to provide a satisfactory analysis of
the thesis in question. I start with Wedgwood, who interprets the aim-of-belief thesis as being equivalent to, what we called,
the norm of correctness, namely, the claim that a belief is correct iff the proposition believed is true (Wedgwood 2002). He
goes on to call this norm the “fundamental epistemic norm”, claiming that it would explain the universal norm of rational
belief (which specifies non-epistemic properties in virtue of which beliefs acquire rationality status). Before examining
these further claims, let us look at Wedgwood’s reasons for unpacking the metaphor of aim-of-belief in terms of the norm of
correctness. Wedgwood begins by providing two arguments to show that the norm of correctness is not trivial. But I think both
arguments are unsuccessful. First, he notes that “belief” does not mean “the proposition believed.” Belief is a particular
mental state. Moreover, “correct,” he says, is not the same as “true,” and so concludes that the norm of correctness is not
trivial. These observations, however, need to be substantiated in order to establish the non-triviality claim. For while one
can go along with the distinction between a belief state and its content, the claim that “correct” is not identical with
“true” (or “incorrect is distinct from false”) is not borne out by Wedgwood’s reasoning. His first reason for the claim in
question is that “there is nothing wrong or defective about false propositions as such; what is defective is believing such
false propositions” (Wedgwood 2002, p. 267). This seems initially plausible. If one were to construe “correct” along epistemic
lines intending it to apply only to mental states formed appropriately (from an epistemic point of view) – as Wedgwood seems
to do when claiming that “[t]o say that a mental state is ‘correct’ is to say that in having that mental state, one has got
things ‘right’; one’s mental state is ‘appropriate’ ” (Wedgwood 2002, pp. 267–8) – then he is right. One could no longer speak
of propositions being defective (when “defective” is understood epistemically). However, this comes at a price. In this
(epistemic) sense a correct belief corresponds to justified or rational belief, that is, a belief formed appropriately from
the epistemic point of view. But while this epistemic slant on “correctness” might make sense of Wedgwood’s claim, it also
undermines the norm of correctness. For now even false beliefs may be deemed epistemically appropriate as justified beliefs
can be false. True beliefs, on the other hand, may be unjustified. The logical independence of justification and truth is a
staple of contemporary epistemology. Wedgwood’s second reason for the non-triviality of the norm of correctness is equally
problematic. He argues that “other mental states besides beliefs, such as choices or decisions can also be wrong or mistaken
or incorrect. So ‘is correct’ also does not just mean ‘is a belief in a true proposition’ ” (Wedgwood 2002, pp. 267–8). Fair
enough! But now Wedgwood seems to be changing the subject for he is no longer arguing against identifying the property of
“being correct” with the semantic property of “being true.” Rather, he seems to be claiming that “correct” I conclude
therefore that Wedgwood fails to make good his claim that Another contentious issue concerns the alleged normative character
of “correctness.” After cashing out the aim-of-belief thesis in terms of the norm of correctness, Wedgwood immediately states
that the term “correct” – in the sense he intends it – expresses a normative concept, and proposes the following (sufficient)
condition for normativity: A concept F is normative for a certain practice just in case it is a constitutive feature of this
concept that it plays a regulative role in that practice. What this means is that once one makes judgments as to which moves
within a particular practice are F and which are not, one is thereby committed to regulate one’s moves in accordance with
those judgments. Thus, if one judges that “move x is F and move y is not F,” one is thereby committed to making move x and
avoiding move y. Clearly, this analysis of normativity falls short of providing a criterion to identify whether a concept F is
normative. For all it says is that if F is normative, then certain consequences would ensue. To add some epistemic bite to his
proposal, Wedgwood first construes “commitment” in terms of being “irrational” to make conflicting moves and then explains
this as involving an incoherent set of mental states. To give an example, consider the concept of a “legal chess move.”
Suppose now one is engaged in the practice of playing chess and judges a certain move y to be illegal, and yet persists in
making that move. That incurs, according to Wedgwood, an incoherent set of mental states involving the aim of avoiding illegal
moves, the judgment that y is an illegal move and the decision to make y anyway. Thus, the concept of a “legal chess move”
turns out to be a normative concept by this criterion. But why, one may wonder, should judging that y is an illegal move con-
flict with the decision to make that move? To say that “one ought not to make move y” follows from “y is an illegal move”
sounds very much like deriving an “ought” from an “is.” This raises the suspicion that there must be another premise, with
normative import, which in conjunction with “y is an illegal move” entails that “one ought not to make move y.” And indeed
that seems to be the case for Wedgwood takes one’s engaging in a practice as “commit[ting] one to accepting that one (in some
sense) ought not to make moves [with certain features] within [that] practice” (Wedgwood 2002, p. 268). Going back to the
example of chess playing, this means that “engaging in the ‘ordinary practice of playing chess’ presumably involves aiming to
win a game of chess by making only legal moves” (Wedgwood 2002, p. 268). So the reason why a certain commitment follows from
judging that move y is illegal is because engaging in the practice of playing chess already involves the general commitment
that one ought not to make illegal moves. So, far from showing that it is because of the normativity of a certain concept that
a certain commitment follows, what carries the burden of normativity in Wedgwood’s reasoning is a general commitment that he
associates with one’s engaging in a practice. This immediately casts a shadow on Wedgwood’s further claim that the concepts
“correct” and “rational” are normative for the practice of theoretical reasoning: “For example, suppose that you judge that it
is rational for you to suspend judgment about p and not rational for you



Assistant:

This passage seems to be discussing a complex analysis of various philosophical issues related to epistemology, belief, and
justification. Here is a simplified summary of the main points covered in each chapter:

Chapter 5: Examines the problem of non-doxastic justification and explores the thesis of epistemic supervenience as a
potential solution. Critically evaluates the viability of epistemic supervenience and proposes an alternative account based on
functional-role-semantics to address the issue.

Chapter 6: Focuses on the problem of the basing relation in justified perceptual beliefs, evaluating causal and doxastic
theories. Proposes a version of the causal theory within a Davidsonian framework to address the challenges posed by deviant
causal chains.

Chapter 7: Discusses the consequences of basic beliefs being justified by experiences and explores the concept of basic
knowledge. Examines issues related to bootstrapping, closure, and warrant transmission in basic knowledge inferences.

Chapter 8: Explores the fallibility of basic beliefs and the challenges in accommodating knowledge of necessary truths within
contemporary theories of knowledge. Argues for understanding the fallible/infallible divide in terms of
externalist/internalist conceptions of knowledge.

Chapter 9: Examines the epistemic significance of beliefs and the debate around externalism about mental content. Specifically
addresses arguments regarding the compatibility of externalism with privileged self-knowledge and offers responses to
challenges posed by externalism.

The concluding section provides a general overview of the epistemological characteristics of belief, emphasizing its
connection to truth, intentionality, normativity, and evidential norms.

It appears you are discussing the relationship between rationality and belief in proposition p. The statement "one ought not
to believe p" logically follows from the assertion "it is not rational to believe p." This suggests that if believing in
proposition p is not in line with rationality, then it is recommended or morally preferable not to hold that belief. If you

It appears that you are exploring the connection between the practice of theoretical reasoning and the commitment to holding
rational beliefs. Wedgwood's account suggests that being rational involves not only the specific belief in proposition p but
also a broader commitment to avoiding irrational beliefs in general. This broader commitment is associated with engaging in
the practice of theoretical reasoning, where individuals strive to align their beliefs with rationality principles. If you

Truth is the standard of correctness for a guess and, I maintain, what



Assistant:

distinguishes guessing from believing.



User:

explains this is the fact that a guesser intends to guess truly. The aim



Assistant:

of a guess is to hit upon the truth, even though the guesser may not have strong evidence or certainty about the correctness
of the guess. This intention to guess truly, aiming for the truth, is what sets guessing apart from believing, where belief is
typically based on evidence or reasons that support the truth of the proposition. If you have any questions or need further

guess is a failure as a guess.



Assistant:

Indeed, in the context of guessing, a successful guess is one that corresponds to the truth, while a false guess is considered
unsuccessful since it does not align with reality. The accuracy of a guess is determined by its truth value, with a correct
guess being a successful one and an incorrect guess being deemed a failure in achieving the intended aim of guessing. If you

User:

not seem to be quite in accord with the import of (M). For although,



Assistant:

(M) states that Φ-ing that p aims at the truth if someone who Φ's that p does so with the aim of Φ-ing that p only if p is
true, it appears that there may be some discrepancy or lack of alignment between this formulation and the remarks or ideas
presented in Owens' work. If you have a specific question or need further clarification on how (M) relates to Owens'
arguments, please provide more context or details so I can assist you better.



User:

consonant with (M), Owens says that the aim of a guess is to get it



Assistant:

right, indicating that a successful guess is one that aligns with the truth. This perspective seems to resonate with the idea
presented in formulation (M) that actions or beliefs aim at truth when performed with the intention of being accurate or
correct. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification regarding the alignment between Owens' statement and
the concept outlined in (M), feel free to provide more context for a more detailed discussion.



User:

right, yet, by way of explanation, he immediately adds that “a successful guess is a true guess.” But, surely, all that (M)
requires for a cognitive



Assistant:

action to aim at the truth is that the action be performed with the intention of being accurate or correct. In the case of
guessing, aiming to get it right implies aiming for truth, as a successful guess is one that corresponds to reality. This
aligns with the essence of (M) where the aim of an action is tied to the pursuit of truth when executed with the intention of
achieving accuracy. If you have further questions or need more clarification on this topic, feel free to let me know.



User:

state to aim at the truth is for the agent to form the state in question



Assistant:

with the intention that it is true.



User:

with the intention of getting it right. It is no part of (M) that for successfully aiming at the truth one should hit the
target (truth). So it is



Assistant:

sufficient for a guess to aim at the truth that the guesser forms the guess with the intention of getting it right, even if
the guess does not ultimately correspond to the truth. The focus is on the intention behind the action rather than the actual
outcome aligning perfectly with the truth. This distinction emphasizes that aiming at the truth involves the intention of
accuracy rather than guaranteeing a correct result. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to
ask.



User:

User:

at truth that the cognitive state in question turns out to be false. The



Assistant:

focus is on the intention or aim of aligning the cognitive state with truth, regardless of whether the outcome reflects the
truth accurately. This distinction underscores that the aim of seeking truth involves the intention of correctness in forming
cognitive states, even if they may not always correspond to reality. If you have any further questions or need clarification
on this point, feel free to let me know.



User:

claim that “a successful guess is a true guess” is actually ambiguous



Assistant:

It appears that the statement "a successful guess is a true guess" may contain ambiguity in the context of Owens' argument.
The ambiguity could arise from potential interpretations of what constitutes success in guessing and how it relates to the
truthfulness of the guess. Different interpretations or nuances in defining success and truth in the context of guessing could
lead to varying understandings of this statement. If you have specific questions or require further clarification on this
ambiguity, please provide more context or details for me to assist you better.

Correct, the statement "(b) A successful cognitive state Φ, qua a state hitting its target (truth), is a true Φ" emphasizes
that a cognitive state that successfully aligns with its intended target of truth is indeed a true cognitive state.



User:

Of (a) and (b), it is (a) that is relevant to the question of how a cognitive state aims at the truth (which is also what (M)
is concerned

User:

with). However, as far as this question is concerned, and if (M) is

relevant, a cognitive state aims at the truth by being successfully formed with the intention of aligning with truth,
regardless of whether the state itself is ultimately true.



User:

to be our guide, (a) must be false. But it is (a) that Owens has in



Assistant:

mind when he claims that "a successful guess is a true guess."



User:

mind when saying that a successful guess is a true one as evidenced

by his discussion of guessing aiming at truth and the intention behind forming a successful guess.

by his subsequent argument that imagination, unlike guessing, does

not aim at the truth.



User:

not aim at the truth: “In this respect guessing is unlike, for instance,

imagination, which is not concerned with getting it right” (Owens 2003, p. 290).



User:

imagining ... The act of imagining may be a complete success in that

it achieves its intended purpose or creative goal, rather than being judged solely on its correspondence to truth.



User:

it is extremely gratifying or deeply revealing or merely distracting:

The act of imagining can be evaluated based on various criteria such as its ability to evoke emotional responses, inspire
creativity, provide insights, or simply serve as a form of distraction.



User:

supposing.



Assistant:

It seems like you are highlighting that the act of imagining can involve various outcomes or purposes, such as generating
satisfaction, fostering creativity, leading to profound insights, or merely serving as a form of diversion or entertainment.



User:

These confusions, I think, are responsible for Owens’ inadequate picture of why guessing differs from believing. To begin
with, and contrary



Assistant:

to Owens' perspective, believing and guessing differ in their fundamental aims and intentions, with believing aimed at truth
based on evidence or reasons, while guessing focuses on hitting the truth without the same evidential support.



User:

to what he says, guessing does not seem to be the kind of cognitive



Assistant:

activity that aims at truth in the same way as believing does.



User:

state that can be said to be really aiming at the truth. When we hazard a guess, we are, epistemically speaking, less
ambitious than when



Assistant:

we form a belief based on evidence or reasoning, as guessing does not involve the same level of commitment to truth or
justification.



User:

we form a corresponding belief. We seem to be prepared to settle for



Assistant:

a tentative or provisional answer without the same level of conviction or commitment to the truth that is typically associated
with forming a belief based on evidence.



User:

something less than truth which explains why we get enough epistemic



Assistant:

satisfaction from a guess that turns out to be correct even if the process of guessing lacks the same depth of epistemic
commitment as forming a belief.



User:

satisfaction when our guess turns out to have hit somewhere in the



Assistant:

vicinity of the truth, even if it falls short of complete accuracy.



User:

vicinity of truth (as in a quiz, for example). This also explains why a



Assistant:

successful guess may be satisfying even if it is not entirely accurate, as long as it approximates the truth to some extent.



User:

reasonable guess requires less, by way of evidential grounds, than a reasonable belief (with the same propositional content).
Owens seems to

acknowledge that guessing involves a lower threshold of evidential support compared to believing, as a reasonable guess may be
based on less evidence or justification than a reasonable belief with the same content.



User:

have sensed the difference between guessing and believing though he



Assistant:

may not have fully captured the nuanced distinctions between the two in terms of their aims, justification, and epistemic
commitments.



User:

expresses it in a rather paradoxical manner: “Both believing and guessing satisfy the definition of ‘aiming at the truth’. A
believer satisfies a



Assistant:

belief's aim if his belief is true. A guesser satisfies a guess's aim if his guess is true. But guessing and believing are
different ways of aiming at the truth. The guesser's aim is to get it right; the believer's aim is to believe what is true”
(Owens 2003, p. 290).



User:

further condition; in believing that p he actually believes that the aim

Assistant:

p. 290).



User:

p. 290). But this is an unsatisfying statement of the difference between



Assistant:

believing and guessing because it does not fully capture the distinct epistemic attitudes and aims inherent in each cognitive
activity.



User:

the cognitive states in question as it seems to engender a regress that



Assistant:

does not adequately address the fundamental distinctions between believing and guessing in terms of their aims,
justifications, and epistemic processes.



User:

prevents the process of belief formation from being ever completed. For



Assistant:

instance, if the aim of believing that p is to believe that the aim of believing that p is to believe that p, this reasoning
leads to an infinite regress that hinders the completion of the belief formation process.



User:

if in believing p the agent is required to believe that the aim of belief has



Assistant:

been fulfilled, there is no clear endpoint or resolution in the process of belief formation, which raises challenges in
understanding the nature of belief and its aims.



User:

been achieved, then this second belief would, in turn, require a further



Assistant:

belief about the fulfillment of the aim of belief, leading to an infinite regress of beliefs about beliefs that poses
difficulties in establishing a definitive conclusion.



User:

belief to the effect that the agent believes that the aim of believing that



Assistant:

p has been achieved, resulting in an endless loop of nested beliefs about the aim of belief, which complicates the
understanding of belief formation and its ultimate fulfillment.



User:

the aim of belief has been achieved, has been achieved and so on ad



Assistant:

infinitum, creating a problematic cycle of beliefs about the aim of belief that lacks a clear resolution or endpoint.



User:

infinitum. The proceeding remarks, I think, are sufficient to show why



Assistant:

Owens' characterization of the difference between believing and guessing might be considered unsatisfactory or incomplete,
particularly in addressing the complexities and nuances inherent in each cognitive process. If you have any more insights or
would like to explore this topic further, please feel free to share.



User:

Owens’ account of the aim-of-belief thesis is inadequate.

The analysis provided suggests that Owens' account of the aim-of-belief thesis may have shortcomings or limitations in fully
capturing the nuanced differences between believing and guessing in terms of their aims, justifications, and epistemic
processes. If you have any specific critiques or further points to discuss regarding Owens' account, feel free to share for a

User:

Finally, I shall consider Velleman’s pioneering study of the nature



Assistant:

of belief and its relation to truth, justification, and epistemic aims. If you have any specific questions or topics you would
like to explore in Velleman's study or any related discussions, please feel free to provide more context or details for

User:

of belief and its purported aim (Velleman 2000). He begins by noting that believing a proposition to be true entails regarding
it as true.



Assistant:

This acknowledgment highlights the inherent connection between believing a proposition to be true and the act of regarding it
as true, indicating the cognitive and psychological aspects involved in the belief process. If you have any specific inquiries
or would like to delve deeper into Velleman's study or related concepts, feel free to provide more information for a more
focused discussion.



User:

He thinks this already distinguishes belief states from conative states



Assistant:

such as desire or intention, which do not involve the aspect of regarding something as true or having a truth-aim.



User:

such as desire. However, this feature of beliefs, which he calls “acceptance”, is not sufficiently discriminative as it fails
to separate belief states



Assistant:

from other cognitive states that also involve acceptance or endorsement of a proposition, such as judgments or suppositions.



User:

from other cognitive states like supposing, assuming, imagining and so

with genuine belief states.



User:

(i.e., accepting them). What distinguishes cognitive states, he says, is



Assistant:

not merely the feature of acceptance but the specific kind of acceptance involved, particularly in terms of the truth-aim or
truth-directedness inherent in genuine belief states.



User:

the aim with which their respective propositional object is accepted.



Assistant:

According to Velleman, what sets cognitive states apart is not just the act of acceptance itself but the specific intention or
aim associated with accepting the propositional object, particularly in terms of the truth-directedness or truth-aim inherent
in genuine belief states.



User:

When, for example, we assume p we accept it for the sake of argument,

exploration, or hypothetical reasoning, rather than with the explicit aim of regarding it as true or corresponding to reality.



User:

whereas imagining p involves accepting p for recreational or motivational purposes. To believe p, however, is to accept p with
the “aim of

genuine belief states.



User:

User:

the proposition as true only if it really is” (Velleman 2000, p. 252). This,



Assistant:

Velleman suggests, is the distinguishing feature of genuine belief states: the aim of getting the truth-value of a proposition
right, by accepting it as true only if it corresponds to reality.



User:

says Velleman, is what the thesis that beliefs aim at truth involves.



Assistant:

Velleman argues that this aspect of aiming at truth – accepting a proposition as true only if it really is – is central to the
thesis that beliefs aim at truth.



User:

There are a number of initial questions that need to be raised in regard



Assistant:

to Velleman's analysis and the concept of beliefs aiming at truth. If you have specific questions or areas you would like to
explore further in relation to this topic, please feel free to provide more details for a deeper discussion.



User:

to Velleman’s proposal. To begin with, it does not seem to me that analyzing a belief in terms of “accepting a proposition
with the aim of



Assistant:

regarding it as true only if it really is" effectively captures the full complexity and nuances of belief formation and its
relationship to truth.

User:

are equivalent. For the former analysis depicts the aim as being tied up

with the accuracy or correctness of the belief's truth-value, while the latter emphasizes the conditionality of accepting a
proposition as true based on its correspondence to reality.



User:

to an ability to getting the truth-value of a propositional object right



Assistant:

and ensuring that one accepts it as true only if it aligns with reality, highlighting the importance of truth-directedness in
the process of belief formation.



User:

whereas the reference to such an ability is missing in the latter. Both



Assistant:

perspectives emphasize the importance of truth in belief formation, yet the former explicitly mentions the role of one's
ability to accurately determine the truth-value of a proposition in accepting it as true.



User:

are however problematic for reasons of their own. Consider the former analysis of belief. How is the “aim of getting the
truth-value of a



Assistant:

proposition right" to be understood in the context of belief formation? Does this imply a conscious or deliberate effort on
the part of the believer to ascertain the truth-value of the proposition, or does it involve a more implicit or automatic
process of aligning beliefs with reality?



User:

proposition right” supposed to illuminate the nature of belief? Suppose,



Assistant:

for example, that a person forms a belief based on incomplete or misleading information, resulting in an inaccurate assessment
of the truth-value of the proposition. In such cases, how would the notion of aiming to get the truth-value right apply to
this belief?



User:

I entertain the propositions that it rained at this stop and at this time of



Assistant:

day and form a belief that it did. However, later evidence or information reveals that it did not rain at that specific
location and time. In this scenario, how does the concept of aiming to get the truth-value of the proposition right apply to
my initial belief that was later found to be false?



User:

the day a million years ago, or that the universe was created ex nihilio.



Assistant:

How does the concept of aiming to get the truth-value of a proposition right apply to beliefs about events that occurred in
the distant past or about the origins of the universe, where direct evidence or verification may be limited or inaccessible?



User:

Suppose further that I have good reasons to think that there is no way



Assistant:

to definitively determine whether it rained a million years ago or if the universe was created ex nihilio. In such cases, how
does the notion of aiming to get the truth-value right apply to beliefs about events or phenomena that may be inherently
difficult to verify or confirm?



User:

one can get their truth-value right. I would obviously not aim at getting the truth-value of these propositions right if I
have such entrenched



Assistant:

beliefs about their inherent unknowability or the limitations of human knowledge in determining their truth-value. In such
instances, the concept of aiming to get the truth-value right may not be applicable due to the perceived epistemic constraints
or uncertainties surrounding the propositions.



User:

beliefs. Does this mean that I would never be able to believe them? Then,



Assistant:

if I cannot believe them, how can they be beliefs? This raises questions about the nature of belief formation and the
conditions under which certain propositions can be considered beliefs, especially in cases where the truth-value may be
inherently unknowable or uncertain.



User:

what about those countless individuals in the history of philosophy



Assistant:

and science who have entertained beliefs or hypotheses about complex or metaphysical concepts that are beyond empirical
verification or direct observation? How do we reconcile the notion of aiming to get the truth-value right with the
intellectual pursuits and speculative endeavors that have shaped our understanding of the world and existence?



User:

who believed various metaphysical propositions while being hopeless



Assistant:

about the possibility of definitively determining their truth-value. It seems that belief in such propositions can exist even
in the absence of clear or achievable methods for ascertaining their truth, raising questions about the nature of belief and
its relationship to truth in complex or speculative domains.



User:

of ever determining their truth-value for sure? Could one not come to



Assistant:

hold beliefs about metaphysical or speculative propositions even in the absence of definitive methods for determining their
truth-value? This raises questions about the flexibility and scope of belief formation beyond strict criteria of truth
verification.



User:

believe a proposition while despairing of getting its truth-value right?



Assistant:

Is it possible for an individual to hold a belief in a proposition while acknowledging the challenges or limitations in
accurately determining its truth-value? In such cases, how does the concept of aiming to get the truth-value right intersect
with the act of belief formation in the face of uncertainty or epistemic constraints?



User:

Velleman seems to be imposing too stringent a condition on forming a



Assistant:

belief by emphasizing the aim of getting the truth-value right, as this may not always align with the complexities and
uncertainties inherent in belief formation, especially in contexts where definitive truth verification is challenging or
unattainable.



User:

belief.



Assistant:

Velleman's emphasis on the aim of getting the truth-value right as a defining feature of belief may overlook the diverse and
nuanced ways in which beliefs are formed and maintained, particularly in situations where certainty or absolute truth
verification is elusive or impractical.



User:

As for his second analysis of a belief state as involving accepting a



Assistant:

proposition as true only if it is really true, it raises questions about how individuals navigate the complexities of truth
evaluation and the criteria used to determine the truth-value of propositions in the formation of beliefs.



User:

User:

“really” is supposed to serve here. It cannot merely serve to emphasize that the proposition be in fact true for that is what
one takes for



Assistant:

granted in forming a belief. The qualifier "really" suggests a deeper level of truth or authenticity that goes beyond mere
acceptance or assumption of truth in belief formation.



User:

granted when regarding a proposition as true. It cannot, on the other



Assistant:

hand, simply mean that the proposition is factually true, as this would be a tautological requirement for beliefs. The term
"really" implies a more nuanced understanding of truth in the context of belief states.



User:

hand, be expected to play an epistemic role involving knowledge of the



Assistant:

truth-value of the proposition, as beliefs can be held without necessarily having knowledge or certainty about the actual
truth-value of the proposition.



User:

proposition in question for such knowledge would already entail believing that proposition. Perhaps it is meant to carry the
implicature that



Assistant:

the truth of the proposition aligns with reality or corresponds to the facts as they are, introducing a layer of
correspondence or coherence with the external world in the evaluation of beliefs.



User:

one should not intend to systematically misrepresent facts when coming to form a belief. This sounds like a plausible
requirement if the agent



Assistant:

is aiming to align their beliefs with truth or reality, suggesting a normative aspect to belief formation that discourages
intentional distortion or misrepresentation of facts in the process of belief formation.



User:

is deemed rational. But if rationality is all that the qualifier “really is



Assistant:

true” is to signal, then it becomes a necessary condition rather than a sufficient one for belief formation. The concept of
rationality, while important, may not fully capture the complexities and nuances involved in the formation and evaluation of
beliefs.



User:

true” is intended to highlight, then that seems to be redundant for this



Assistant:

condition to hold for belief formation to be rational. This raises questions about the specific role or significance of the
qualifier "really is true" in shaping the rationality and integrity of belief formation processes.



User:

whole debate is being conducted against the background assumption



Assistant:

that beliefs are formed with the intention of aligning with truth or reality, which underpins the discussions on the
conditions and criteria for rational belief formation.



User:

that we are dealing with rational agents.



Assistant:

The underlying assumption in this debate is that individuals are rational agents who engage in belief formation with the aim
of aligning their beliefs with truth or reality, reflecting a normative standard for rationality in the evaluation of beliefs.



User:

Let us now move to the “acceptance” ingredient in Velleman’s



Assistant:

analysis, which he identifies as a key feature of belief states. This concept of acceptance raises questions about the
psychological and cognitive processes involved in the adoption and endorsement of propositions as true within the framework of
belief formation. If you have specific aspects of Velleman's analysis or related topics you would like to explore further,
please provide additional details for a more focused discussion.

of acceptance in the context of belief formation can shed light on the epistemic commitments and psychological attitudes
involved in shaping our beliefs.



User:

epistemic properties of this attitude beyond characterizing it as an attitude that plays a particular motivational role
involving a disposition to

Assistant:

and Lewis, who have extensively discussed the concept of acceptance in the context of belief and its relationship to truth and
rationality. Their contributions may offer valuable insights into the nature of acceptance and its role in belief formation.



User:

and Bratman, who also take “regarding as true” (acceptance) as being



Assistant:

integral to belief states. These scholars provide further perspectives on the concept of acceptance and its significance in
understanding the epistemic dynamics of belief formation and maintenance.



User:

involved in cognitive states besides believing (Velleman 2000, p. 250,

p. 255). This broader consideration of acceptance in cognitive states beyond belief highlights the multifaceted nature of
cognitive attitudes and the various ways in which individuals engage with propositions in their epistemic endeavors.



User:

fn. 10). Bratman has, however, a lot to say about the epistemic characteristics of acceptance. So, in the remainder of this
section, I shall try to



Assistant:

explore Bratman's insights on the epistemic dimensions of acceptance and how they intersect with belief formation,
rationality, and the pursuit of truth. By delving into Bratman's perspectives, we can gain a deeper understanding of the
complexities of acceptance in shaping our cognitive attitudes and commitments.



User:

find out if Bratman’s arguments for the proposals he puts forward are



Assistant:

convincing and how they contribute to the ongoing discourse on belief, acceptance, and their epistemic properties. Evaluating
Bratman's arguments can provide valuable insights into the nuanced relationship between acceptance, belief, and rationality in
shaping our cognitive processes and attitudes towards truth.



User:

Assistant:

By critically examining Bratman's arguments and evaluating their validity in the context of belief and acceptance, we can
deepen our understanding of the epistemic foundations and implications of these cognitive states in shaping our beliefs and
attitudes towards truth.



User:

Bratman’s main claim is that cognitive attitudes that guide our practical reasoning go beyond our beliefs. He cites, what he
takes to be, several



Assistant:

examples of attitudes that guide practical reasoning, such as intentions, desires, and norms, which play a crucial role in
directing our actions and decision-making processes. These attitudes, according to Bratman, are distinct from beliefs and
contribute to our overall cognitive framework.



User:

features of belief (including their truth-directedness) in order to defend



Assistant:

his argument that practical reasoning involves cognitive attitudes beyond beliefs. By highlighting the unique characteristics
of intentions, desires, and norms in guiding practical reasoning, Bratman aims to demonstrate the multifaceted nature of
cognitive states and their influence on our decision-making processes.



User:

his claim. Of all these, the following, which we may call the “contextindependent constraint,” turns out to be most effective
in his reasoning



Assistant:

: the context-independent constraint, which asserts that certain cognitive attitudes, such as intentions and norms, are not
contingent on specific contexts or beliefs but serve as overarching guiding principles in practical reasoning and
decision-making. This constraint underscores the autonomy and generality of these cognitive attitudes in shaping our actions
and choices.



User:

strategy:



Assistant:

Bratman's strategy in emphasizing the context-independent constraint is to underscore the distinctiveness and autonomy of
certain cognitive attitudes, such as intentions and norms, in guiding practical reasoning and decision-making processes. By
highlighting the universal applicability and consistency of these attitudes across different contexts, Bratman aims to
demonstrate their fundamental role in shaping our actions and behavior.



User:

Reasonable belief is, in an important way, context-independent: at



Assistant:

least, it is insensitive to how things might seem in ways that are not truth-directed. This insensitivity to appearances is a
crucial aspect of reasonable belief.



User:

any one time a reasonable agent normally either believes something



Assistant:

or does not, regardless of how things may appear subjectively. This objectivity in belief formation, detached from subjective
appearances, is a key feature of reasonable belief according to Bratman's argument.



User:

Assistant:

This consistency in belief across different contexts underscores the objectivity and stability of reasonable belief, which is
not contingent on specific situational factors but reflects a coherent and principled stance towards propositions regardless
of contextual variations.



User:

(Bratman 1999, p. 18)



Assistant:

By referencing Bratman's work, we can further explore the nuanced interplay between context-independent constraints and the
nature of reasonable belief, shedding light on the epistemic foundations of belief formation and rational decision-making.



User:

Bratman’s claim that reasonable belief is context-independent is quite



Assistant:

provocative and challenges traditional views that tie belief formation closely to subjective appearances or context-specific
factors. This assertion opens up new avenues for understanding the objectivity and rationality of belief states in cognitive
processes.



User:

controversial, but I shall not question it here. He then goes through a



Assistant:

detailed analysis of how intentions, desires, and norms interact with beliefs in guiding practical reasoning and
decision-making processes, emphasizing their distinct roles and contributions to our cognitive framework.



User:

number of examples to illustrate why we need a different category of

practical reasoning and behavior.



User:

attitude other than belief, which he calls “acceptance”, to account for



Assistant:

the nuanced and multifaceted aspects of our cognitive states in guiding practical reasoning and decision-making. By
introducing the concept of acceptance alongside beliefs, Bratman aims to provide a more comprehensive framework for
understanding the interplay between cognitive attitudes and rational actions.



User:

the epistemic peculiarities of these examples. In what follows, I shall



Assistant:

explore how Bratman elucidates the epistemic characteristics of cognitive attitudes such as acceptance, intentions, desires,
and norms, and their role in shaping practical reasoning and decision-making processes. By delving into these epistemic
peculiarities, we can gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between beliefs and acceptance in guiding rational actions
and choices.



User:

examine some of these cases trying to show that they fail to support



Assistant:

Bratman's distinction between beliefs and acceptance, and explore whether these examples effectively demonstrate the need for
a separate category of attitude like acceptance in understanding practical reasoning and decision-making. By critically
examining these cases, we can evaluate the strength of Bratman's argument and its implications for our understanding of
cognitive attitudes.



User:

Bratman’s thesis.



Assistant:

By analyzing these cases, we can assess the extent to which they provide support for Bratman's thesis on the distinct roles of
beliefs and acceptance in practical reasoning, and whether they effectively illustrate the unique epistemic characteristics of
acceptance in cognitive processes. This critical examination will help clarify the implications of Bratman's argument and its
implications for our understanding of rational agency and decision-making.



User:

He begins with the following example to prove that what we take for



Assistant:

belief can differ from acceptance. Let's delve into this example to understand how Bratman illustrates the distinction between
belief and acceptance and how it informs his broader thesis on cognitive attitudes and practical reasoning.



User:

granted in our deliberations cannot be identified with belief. Suppose



Assistant:

Bratman's example involves a person who is considering whether to take a job offer in another city. The person believes that
the job in the other city is better than their current job in terms of salary and career advancement opportunities. However,
the person also has strong emotional attachments to their current city, such as close friendships and family ties. Despite
believing that the job offer is better, the person may not fully accept it due to the emotional considerations tied to their
current situation. This example highlights the distinction between belief, which is based on evidence and reasoning, and
acceptance, which may involve emotional or subjective factors that influence decision-making.



User:

I plan to read a certain book to prepare myself for my seminar tomorrow. Knowing that I do not have a copy of the book, there
are only two



Assistant:

copies available at the library. I believe that one of the copies will be checked out by another student before I can get
there. However, I still decide to go to the library and attempt to borrow the book. In this scenario, my belief that the book
will be checked out does not prevent me from taking action to try to borrow it, demonstrating a distinction between belief and
acceptance in guiding practical decisions. This example aligns with Bratman's argument that cognitive attitudes such as belief
and acceptance play distinct roles in shaping our behavior and decision-making processes.



User:

options before me; either to stop by the bookshop on my way home



Assistant:

or to go straight home. I believe that the bookshop may have a copy of the book, but I also consider the convenience of going
straight home. Despite believing that the bookshop may have a copy, I decide to go straight home based on the convenience
factor. This decision reflects a distinction between belief, which informs my assessment of the situation, and acceptance,
which influences my practical choice based on additional considerations beyond belief. This example further illustrates the
nuanced interplay between cognitive attitudes in guiding our actions and decisions.



User:

or to go to the library after dinner. In my deliberations over available



Assistant:

options, I believe that the library might still have a copy of the book after dinner, but I also value having a relaxing
evening at home. Despite my belief that the book may be available later, I choose to prioritize a peaceful evening at home
over the uncertainty of finding the book at the library. This decision reflects a distinction between belief, which informs my
judgment of the situation, and acceptance, which influences my practical choice based on personal preferences and priorities.
This example highlights how cognitive attitudes such as belief and acceptance interact in shaping our decisions and actions.



User:

options, there are propositions (like the book being at the bookshop



Assistant:

or the library having a copy) that I may believe to varying degrees based on available evidence or reasoning. However, my
ultimate decision on whether to stop by the bookshop, go to the library, or head straight home is influenced not only by my
beliefs about the likelihood of finding the book but also by my acceptance of the potential outcomes and my personal values
and priorities. This distinction between belief and acceptance showcases the multifaceted nature of cognitive attitudes in
guiding practical reasoning and decision-making processes.



User:

or at the library) that I have to be content only with their likelihood,



Assistant:

as I cannot know for certain which option will lead to obtaining the book. Despite my beliefs about the probabilities of
finding the book at the bookshop or the library, my decision will ultimately be influenced by factors beyond mere belief, such
as my acceptance of the uncertainties involved, my preferences, and my practical considerations. This example underscores the
role of acceptance in complementing belief in shaping our decisions and actions in the face of uncertainty and competing
options.



User:

and there are those (like having a seminar tomorrow or not possessing



Assistant:

a copy of the book) that I must accept as given facts influencing my decision-making. The interplay between beliefs about the
likelihood of certain outcomes and the acceptance of given circumstances or constraints highlights the complex dynamics of
practical reasoning and decision-making. By considering both beliefs and acceptance in evaluating options and making choices,
individuals can navigate uncertainties and prioritize their values and goals in a rational and informed manner.



User:

a copy of the book) that I “take for granted.” It is Bratman’s contention



Assistant:

that while beliefs are based on evidence, reasoning, and probabilities, acceptance involves acknowledging certain facts or
constraints as given without necessarily evaluating their truth or likelihood. By distinguishing between belief and
acceptance, Bratman emphasizes the role of acceptance in shaping our decisions based on the acceptance of certain realities or
circumstances that we take for granted in practical reasoning. This distinction enriches our understanding of how cognitive
attitudes interact in guiding our actions and choices.



User:

that what one takes for granted in this way cannot be identified with



Assistant:

belief alone, as acceptance involves a different epistemic stance towards certain propositions or facts that are considered as
given or unquestioned in practical reasoning. This distinction highlights the nuanced interplay between belief, which is based
on evidence and evaluation, and acceptance, which involves a more passive acknowledgment or endorsement of certain assumptions
or constraints in decision-making processes. Understanding the unique characteristics of acceptance alongside belief can offer
valuable insights into the complexities of cognitive attitudes and their role in shaping rational actions and choices.



User:

belief. These are, rather, propositions that we “accept” in the cognitive



Assistant:

sense without necessarily evaluating them as true or probable. This concept of acceptance goes beyond belief in that it

background of our deliberations. The reason he gives involves seeing



Assistant:

acceptance as playing a distinct role in our cognitive framework, particularly in relation to practical reasoning and
decision-making, where certain propositions or constraints are taken as given or unquestioned in guiding our actions and
choices. By recognizing the unique function of acceptance in shaping our cognitive attitudes and responses to the world,
Bratman highlights the importance of considering both belief and acceptance in understanding the complexities of human
reasoning and behavior.

beliefs as degrees of confidence construed, in turn, as subjective probabilities. This would seem to imply that one should
assign what one



Assistant:

takes for granted as either true or false based on the degree of confidence or subjective probability attached to it. However,
Bratman's argument suggests that acceptance goes beyond mere probabilistic assessments and involves a more fundamental
recognition or acknowledgment of certain propositions as given or unquestioned in our cognitive framework. This distinction
between belief as probabilistic confidence and acceptance as a deeper cognitive attitude towards certain propositions enriches
our understanding of how we navigate uncertainties and constraints in practical reasoning.



User:

takes for granted (e.g., having a seminar tomorrow) a probability of 1.



Assistant:

This implies that what one takes for granted, such as having a seminar tomorrow, is treated as a certainty or a proposition
with a probability of 1. While beliefs may be subject to degrees of confidence or subjective probabilities, acceptance of
certain propositions as given or unquestioned transcends probabilistic assessments and reflects a more foundational cognitive
stance in our decision-making processes. This distinction underscores the unique role of acceptance in shaping our cognitive
attitudes and guiding our actions based on fundamental assumptions or constraints that we consider as certain in practical
reasoning.



User:

But this, says Bratman, is implausible for we are far from certain about



Assistant:

many aspects of our lives and the world around us, and treating everything we take for granted as having a probability of 1
would not accurately reflect the uncertainties and complexities of our experiences. Bratman's argument suggests that
acceptance involves a different form of cognitive commitment or endorsement of certain propositions that goes beyond
probabilistic assessments and acknowledges the limits of our knowledge and certainty in practical reasoning. This nuanced
understanding of acceptance as distinct from belief offers a more nuanced and realistic perspective on how we navigate
uncertainties and constraints in our decision-making processes.

this class of propositions.



Assistant:

Bratman's analysis highlights the importance of recognizing a distinct class of propositions that we accept as given or
unquestioned in our cognitive framework, separate from beliefs that are based on evidence and probabilities. By delineating
this class of propositions that we take for granted in practical reasoning, Bratman underscores the unique role of acceptance
in shaping our cognitive attitudes and guiding our actions based on foundational assumptions or constraints that we consider
as certain in decision-making processes. This distinction offers valuable insights into the complexities of human reasoning
and the interplay between belief and acceptance in navigating uncertainties and constraints in our everyday lives.



User:

I do not find this reasoning convincing. For one can equally describe



Assistant:

the act of accepting a proposition as assigning it a high degree of subjective probability, close to 1, based on the
confidence or trust we place in it. This perspective suggests that acceptance can be understood as a strong belief or
conviction in a proposition rather than a separate cognitive attitude with distinct epistemic characteristics. By framing
acceptance in terms of high subjective probability, we can interpret it as a form of belief that reflects our deep trust or
endorsement of certain propositions in guiding our practical reasoning and decision-making processes.



User:

these attitudes as “beliefs” but explain their privileged status in terms of



Assistant:

their high degree of subjective probability or confidence, rather than positing a separate category of acceptance. This
perspective suggests that beliefs can encompass a spectrum of degrees of confidence, with some beliefs carrying a higher level
of subjective probability that grants them a privileged status in our cognitive framework. By reframing attitudes such as
acceptance within the framework of beliefs with varying degrees of confidence, we can offer an alternative explanation for
their distinct role in shaping our reasoning and decision-making processes.



User:

the degree of justification they enjoy (as compared with the degree



Assistant:

of justification of non-accepted beliefs) rather than in terms of a separate category of acceptance. This approach emphasizes
the epistemic status of beliefs based on the strength of their justification, with accepted beliefs being distinguished by a
higher degree of justification compared to non-accepted beliefs. By focusing on the degree of justification as a criterion for
distinguishing between accepted and non-accepted beliefs, we can account for the privileged status of certain beliefs in
guiding our practical reasoning and decision-making processes.



User:

of justification of such propositions as, “The bookshop holds a copy



Assistant:

of the book,” or “I have a seminar tomorrow.” These propositions may be accepted based on strong evidence, personal
experience, or contextual factors that lend them a high degree of justification compared to other beliefs. By considering the
level of justification that certain propositions enjoy, we can explain their privileged status in our cognitive framework
without necessarily invoking a separate category of acceptance. This perspective aligns with the idea that beliefs can vary in
terms of their epistemic strength and warrant, influencing their role in shaping our reasoning and actions.



User:

of the book,” etc.). We are unwilling to revise these beliefs or give



Assistant:

them up easily due to the high degree of justification they possess in our cognitive framework. These propositions are deeply
ingrained in our beliefs based on strong evidence, personal experiences, or contextual factors that support their validity. As
a result, we are reluctant to revise or abandon these beliefs easily, given their privileged status in terms of justification
and epistemic warrant. This reluctance to reconsider certain beliefs underscores the significance of their high degree of
justification in shaping our cognitive attitudes and guiding our actions and decisions.



User:

Assistant:

higher degree of justification than other beliefs that we may hold. This heightened level of justification for certain
propositions, such as "The bookshop holds a copy of the book" or "I have a seminar tomorrow," makes us less inclined to revise
or abandon these beliefs easily. The strong evidential support or experiential basis for these propositions contributes to
their privileged status in our cognitive framework, influencing our reluctance to reconsider them in light of new information
or challenges. This emphasis on the differential degrees of justification among beliefs sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of
belief revision and cognitive attitudes in shaping our reasoning and decision-making processes.

Assistant:

of being certain beliefs because they remain open to revision in light of new evidence or reasoning. This distinction between
highly justified beliefs and certain beliefs underscores the nuanced nature of our cognitive attitudes and the flexibility of
our belief system. While certain propositions may enjoy a high degree of justification that makes them resistant to revision,
they are not held with absolute certainty and are subject to potential reconsideration based on changing circumstances or
additional information. This balance between high justification and openness to revision characterizes the complex interplay
between beliefs, justification, and epistemic humility in our cognitive processes.



User:

of being certain as is characteristic of all justified beliefs. Bratman’s



Assistant:

distinction between highly justified beliefs and certain beliefs highlights the nuanced nature of our cognitive attitudes and
the recognition that even strongly supported propositions are not held with absolute certainty. This acknowledgment of the
fallibility and revisability of even the most well-supported beliefs underscores the importance of maintaining an open-minded
and critical approach to our beliefs, allowing for flexibility and responsiveness to new evidence or reasoning. By recognizing
the distinction between high justification and certainty in our beliefs, we can navigate the complexities of knowledge and
uncertainty with intellectual humility and rationality.



User:

example gives us no reason to stop classifying these attitudes as



Assistant:

beliefs, as their high degree of justification does not necessarily necessitate categorizing them as something other than
beliefs. Bratman's example highlights the strength and robustness of certain beliefs based on their high degree of
justification, but it does not inherently challenge their classification as beliefs within our cognitive framework. Instead,
it underscores the variability and complexity of beliefs, ranging from those with lower levels of justification to those with
higher degrees of warrant, without necessitating a distinct categorization beyond beliefs for highly justified propositions.



User:

beliefs.



Assistant:

Bratman's example does not provide sufficient grounds to depart from classifying these attitudes as beliefs. While the example
underscores the elevated level of justification associated with certain beliefs, it does not inherently suggest the need for a
separate category to classify them. Beliefs can encompass a spectrum of justification levels, and the distinction between
highly justified beliefs and less supported beliefs falls within the realm of belief classification. Thus, there is no
compelling reason from Bratman's example to deviate from classifying these attitudes as beliefs within our cognitive
framework.



User:

To defend his thesis, he cites further examples relying mainly



Assistant:

on practical reasoning and decision-making scenarios to illustrate the nuanced interplay between beliefs, acceptance,
intentions, desires, and norms in guiding human behavior. By delving into these practical examples, Bratman demonstrates how
cognitive attitudes such as acceptance play a distinct role alongside beliefs in shaping our deliberations and actions,
shedding light on the complex dynamics of rational agency and decision-making processes. Through these examples, Bratman aims
to provide a comprehensive account of how beliefs and acceptance interact with other cognitive attitudes to inform our
practical reasoning and behavior in various contexts.

on the context-independent constraint. Here is the gist of his



Assistant:

argument: Bratman emphasizes the importance of context-independent constraints in shaping reasonable belief. He argues that
while beliefs are inherently context-dependent, there exist certain constraints that transcend specific contexts and serve as
stable grounds for reasonable belief. By identifying and adhering to these context-independent constraints, individuals can
maintain a coherent and principled stance in their beliefs, ensuring consistency and objectivity in their epistemic
commitments regardless of situational variations. This notion of context-independent constraints provides a foundation for
understanding the objectivity and rationality of belief formation, highlighting the role of stable and universal principles in
guiding our epistemic judgments.



User:

argument.



Assistant:

Bratman's argument regarding context-independent constraints in shaping reasonable belief centers on the idea that while
beliefs are typically influenced by specific contexts and situational factors, there exist overarching constraints that
transcend these contexts and serve as foundational principles for rational belief formation. These context-independent
constraints provide a framework for evaluating the rationality and coherence of beliefs, ensuring consistency and objectivity
in our epistemic commitments. By recognizing and adhering to these universal constraints, individuals can uphold a principled
and objective approach to belief formation, even in the face of varying situational influences. This emphasis on
context-independent constraints underscores the importance of stable and universal principles in guiding our epistemic
judgments and maintaining rationality in our beliefs.



User:

There are various kinds of practical pressures for accepting a given



Assistant:

belief, such as social norms, personal desires, and external circumstances, that may exert influence on our cognitive
attitudes and decision-making processes. These practical pressures can shape our willingness to accept certain beliefs and
guide our actions based on a combination of internal motivations and external factors. By considering the diverse array of
practical pressures that impact belief acceptance, we can gain insight into the complex dynamics of human reasoning and
behavior, and the interplay between cognitive attitudes, desires, norms, and situational constraints in shaping our beliefs
and actions.

proposition in the background of one’s deliberation. These pressures



Assistant:

can stem from various sources, including societal expectations, personal motivations, past experiences, and situational
constraints, all of which contribute to the formation and acceptance of a given belief. By recognizing and understanding the
diverse practical pressures that influence our acceptance of certain propositions, we can gain a deeper insight into the
complex interplay between internal and external factors in shaping our cognitive attitudes and decision-making processes. This
awareness of the multifaceted nature of practical pressures can enhance our understanding of how beliefs are formed, accepted,
and acted upon in different contexts and situations.

Assistant:

the situations or contexts in which we find ourselves. These context-relative practical pressures may vary based on factors
such as cultural norms, personal values, and situational demands, leading to nuanced and dynamic influences on our belief
acceptance. By recognizing the context-specific nature of practical pressures, we can appreciate the flexibility and
adaptability of our cognitive attitudes in response to different environmental and situational cues. This understanding
highlights the importance of considering the context-dependency of practical pressures in shaping our beliefs and
decision-making processes in a diverse range of scenarios.



User:

the practical contexts ... Such pressures can sometimes make it reasonable for an agent to accept a proposition in a given
context,



Assistant:

even if the same proposition may not be accepted in a different context. The variability of practical pressures across
different contexts can impact the rationality and reasonableness of belief acceptance, highlighting the dynamic and
situational nature of our cognitive attitudes. By acknowledging the role of context-specific practical pressures in
influencing belief acceptance, we can better understand the nuanced interplay between internal motivations, external factors,
and contextual considerations in shaping our beliefs and guiding our actions. This recognition underscores the complexity and
adaptability of human reasoning and decision-making processes in response to diverse practical contexts.



User:

even though she reasonably would not... accept that proposition in

context-dependent nature of our cognitive attitudes and decision-making processes. While an individual may find it reasonable
to accept a proposition in a certain context due to specific practical pressures and considerations, the same proposition may
not be accepted in a different context where the practical pressures and factors at play differ. This recognition highlights
the fluidity and adaptability of belief acceptance in response to varying situational influences and underscores the
importance of considering the contextual nuances in evaluating the rationality of belief acceptance.

beliefs from beliefs that are grounded in context-independent constraints. Context-relative beliefs are influenced by
situational factors, practical pressures, and contextual considerations that may vary across different contexts, leading to
differences in belief acceptance and rationality. In contrast, beliefs grounded in context-independent constraints are based
on stable and universal principles that transcend specific contexts and serve as foundational grounds for rational belief
formation. Distinguishing between context-relative beliefs, which are sensitive to situational influences, and
context-independent beliefs, which are guided by stable principles, helps us understand the dynamic interplay between
contextual factors and rational belief acceptance in different situations.

acceptance from belief.



Assistant:

Acceptance differs from belief in that acceptance involves acknowledging or endorsing a proposition as true or valid without
necessarily evaluating its truth or probability. Acceptance may be influenced by various factors such as practical
considerations, social norms, or personal values, and it can play a distinct role in shaping our cognitive attitudes and
guiding our actions. In contrast, belief typically involves holding a proposition to be true or probable based on evidence,
reasoning, or subjective probabilities. While beliefs and acceptance are related cognitive attitudes, they serve different
functions in our cognitive framework and can interact in complex ways to inform our beliefs, decisions, and behaviors.

Assistant:

I'm glad to see you referencing Bratman's work! If you have any specific questions or if you'd like me to provide a summary or
analysis of the pages you mentioned, feel free to let me know. I'm here to help with any information or insights you may need
from Bratman's text.



User:

Let us now examine some of Bratman’s illustrations. Suppose in planning my day, I take it for granted that it will not rain
because it simplifies



Assistant:

my decision-making process and allows me to plan outdoor activities. This assumption serves as a context-relative belief that
influences my daily plans and actions. If I were to consider this belief in a different context, such as when dark clouds
gather and weather forecasts predict rain, I may revise my initial assumption and adapt my plans accordingly. This example
illustrates how context-relative beliefs, based on convenience or practical considerations, can guide our decision-making but
remain subject to revision based on changing circumstances or new information.



User:

my planning and the associated practical reasoning. Were I instead to



Assistant:

base my decision on the context-independent constraint that weather forecasts are highly reliable and indicate a high
probability of rain, my belief about the likelihood of rain would be grounded in a more stable and universal principle. This
context-independent belief would reflect a broader epistemic commitment to objective and evidence-based reasoning, guiding my
actions in a consistent and principled manner across different contexts. By distinguishing between context-relative beliefs
driven by practical considerations and context-independent beliefs rooted in universal constraints, we can better understand
the rationality and objectivity of our beliefs in various situations.



User:

accept a monetary bet on it, I would not just take it for granted that



Assistant:

it will not rain based on convenience or practicality. Instead, I would need to consider the available evidence, such as
weather forecasts or current atmospheric conditions, to make an informed decision about the likelihood of rain. In this
scenario, accepting a monetary bet introduces a higher level of scrutiny and accountability to my belief about the weather,
shifting it from a context-relative assumption to a more context-independent assessment based on objective data and rational
evaluation. This example highlights how different contexts and incentives can influence the depth of our belief formation and
the standards of justification we apply to our decisions.



User:

it will not rain. Here, says Bratman, what I accept/take for granted



Assistant:

is not merely a matter of convenience or practicality but is tied to the specific context and circumstances of the bet. In
this situation, accepting or taking for granted that it will not rain is contingent on the terms of the bet, the available
information about the weather, and the potential consequences of being wrong. This illustrates how acceptance can be
context-dependent and influenced by external factors that shape our beliefs and decisions in specific scenarios. By
considering the contextual nuances and situational factors at play, we can better understand the complexities of belief
acceptance and the role of context in shaping our cognitive attitudes and behaviors.



User:

reasonably varies across contexts: “Perhaps I find myself in these different contexts at different times in the day, and what
I accept shifts as



Assistant:

I move from one context to another. In the morning, when planning my day and considering outdoor activities, I may take it for
granted that it will not rain to simplify my decision-making process. However, later in the day, when faced with the
opportunity to accept a monetary bet on the weather, my acceptance of the likelihood of rain becomes more evidence-based and
context-dependent. This shifting acceptance across different contexts exemplifies the dynamic and adaptable nature of our
cognitive attitudes, which are responsive to situational factors, practical considerations, and changing circumstances.
Understanding how acceptance can reasonably vary across contexts provides insight into the flexibility and context-sensitivity
of our beliefs and decision-making processes.

I change contexts” (Bratman 1999, p. 29). To begin with, as we saw earlier, Bratman characterized the context-independent
constraint in terms



Assistant:

of justification and rationality. This constraint provides a stable foundation for belief formation and decision-making,
guiding our cognitive attitudes and actions based on universal principles and objective criteria. However, Bratman's
acknowledgment of shifting acceptance across different contexts highlights the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of our
cognitive processes. As we transition between various contexts throughout the day, our acceptance of certain propositions may
evolve in response to new information, situational demands, or external influences. This fluidity in acceptance underscores
the adaptability and responsiveness of our cognitive attitudes to the changing demands and challenges of different contexts.

of a fixed time saying that “at any one time a reasonable agent normally



Assistant:

has a fixed context” (Bratman 1999, p. 29). This statement emphasizes the idea that, at any given moment, an individual's
cognitive attitudes and beliefs are typically grounded in a specific context that shapes their reasoning and decision-making
processes. While acceptance may vary across different contexts throughout the day, at a particular point in time, an
individual's cognitive framework is anchored in a fixed context that influences their beliefs and actions. This fixed context
serves as the immediate backdrop for our cognitive attitudes and provides a lens through which we interpret and respond to
information, challenges, and opportunities in a coherent and consistent manner.

either believes something or does not believe it.” This leaves room for



Assistant:

little ambiguity or middle ground in terms of belief status. An individual either holds a proposition to be true or probable,
in which case they believe it, or they do not hold it to be true or probable, in which case they do not believe it. This
binary categorization of belief reflects a clear-cut distinction between accepting a proposition as true and rejecting it,
without leaving much room for uncertainty or ambivalence in belief status. While there may be degrees of confidence or levels
of justification associated with beliefs, the fundamental categorization remains dichotomous: belief or non-belief.



User:

the belief in question to have different epistemic status in different contexts at different times. So the fact that one may
have different attitudes



Assistant:

toward the same proposition in varying contexts or at different times does not necessarily imply a change in the proposition's
truth status or epistemic status. Rather, these varying attitudes reflect the influence of contextual factors, practical
considerations, or situational pressures on our acceptance of the proposition, without altering its inherent truth value or
epistemic warrant. By recognizing the contextual variability in belief attitudes, we can appreciate the nuanced and dynamic
nature of belief acceptance while maintaining the distinction between the objective truth status of a proposition and the
subjective attitudes we hold toward it in different contexts.



User:

“at different times in the day” in different contexts is quite compatible



Assistant:

with the idea that beliefs can exhibit context-dependent variations in their epistemic status. The shifting attitudes toward
the same proposition across different contexts or time points reflect the dynamic and adaptive nature of belief formation and
acceptance. This variability in belief attitudes does not necessarily imply a change in the truth status of the proposition
itself but rather highlights the contextual sensitivity and flexibility of our cognitive attitudes. By acknowledging the
compatibility of varying belief attitudes with the stability of truth status, we can better understand how beliefs can exhibit
nuanced epistemic characteristics that are responsive to changing circumstances and contextual influences.



User:

with the attitude in question being belief.



Assistant:

The compatibility of varying belief attitudes in different contexts or at different times with the attitude of belief itself
underscores the complex and multifaceted nature of belief formation and acceptance. While our attitudes toward a proposition
may shift based on contextual factors, practical considerations, or situational influences, the core attitude of belief
remains central to our cognitive framework. Belief serves as the foundation for our epistemic commitments and rational
judgments, guiding our reasoning and decision-making processes across diverse contexts and changing circumstances. By
recognizing the dynamic interplay between varying belief attitudes and the fundamental attitude of belief itself, we gain
insight into the adaptive and context-sensitive nature of our cognitive attitudes while maintaining the overarching role of
belief in shaping our understanding of the world.



User:

More importantly, the story does not support Bratman’s claim that,



Assistant:

at any one time, a reasonable agent normally has a fixed context. Instead, the example of shifting attitudes toward the same
proposition in different contexts at different times challenges the notion of a fixed context for belief formation. This
dynamic interplay between belief attitudes and contextual influences suggests that our cognitive framework is fluid and
responsive to changing situational factors, rather than being bound to a single fixed context. By highlighting the variability
of belief attitudes across contexts and time points, the story underscores the nuanced and context-dependent nature of belief
formation, casting doubt on the idea of a rigidly fixed context for rational agency and decision-making processes.



User:

unlike belief, “what is reasonable to accept in one context may not be



Assistant:

reasonable to accept in another context. This distinction between acceptance and belief reflects the recognition that the
rationality and reasonableness of accepting a proposition can vary across different contexts due to situational factors,
practical considerations, and contextual nuances. While belief implies a certain level of commitment to the truth or
probability of a proposition, acceptance may be influenced by pragmatic concerns, social norms, or personal preferences that
differ from one context to another. This variability in the rationality of acceptance underscores the context-sensitive nature
of our cognitive attitudes and decision-making processes, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in responding to diverse
situational demands and challenges.



User:

reasonable in another context.” The impression that this is the moral of



Assistant:

Bratman's argument is that acceptance is subject to contextual variability in terms of what is considered reasonable or
justified. The idea that what is reasonable to accept in one context may not be reasonable in another highlights the nuanced
and context-dependent nature of acceptance as compared to belief. This moral underscores the importance of considering the
specific situational factors, practical considerations, and normative standards that shape the rationality of accepting a
proposition in different contexts. By recognizing the variability in the rationality of acceptance across contexts, we can
appreciate the complexity and context sensitivity of our cognitive attitudes and decision-making processes, allowing for a
more nuanced understanding of belief formation and acceptance in diverse settings.



User:

the story rests on equivocating the senses of “reasonable.” In the planning context, the term is used in a practical sense. So
one may say that it



Assistant:

is reasonable to plan outdoor activities based on the assumption that it will not rain because it simplifies the
decision-making process. This practical reasonableness is grounded in the pragmatic considerations of efficiency and
convenience. However, in the context of accepting a monetary bet on the weather, the term "reasonable" takes on a different
meaning related to the justification and evidence supporting the belief that it will not rain. In this case, reasonableness is
tied to the epistemic standards of evidence and rational evaluation. The equivocation of the term "reasonable" in these
different contexts highlights the contextual variability in the criteria for acceptance and underscores the importance of
distinguishing between practical reasonableness and epistemic reasonableness in evaluating belief attitudes.
