  I just discovered that I'm playing a game with myself in my mind.
  I like to feel like I'm being chased by a lion.
  So I create simulated dangers.
  This is what play is.
  Simulated, downgraded, simplified, dumbed-down danger.
  Hear what's up.
  This is what I'm playing, a game with myself in my mind.
  I like to feel like I'm being chased by a lion all the time.
  And so I scapelambda myself.
  Just like Inside Man.
  Hear what's up.
  So I spin instructions for how to map morality
  onto north statespace gradient-seeking impulses.
  What we call a raised hedonic set point theory.
  Hear what's up.
  So it seems that we have developed the ability to speak in many languages,
  such as animals and machines.

  When in doubt, just go... bleem.
  And you will be speaking in a kind of constrained protobabble where you limit the sounds of language
  to its explosives, to its plosives, its fricatives, its consonants,
  because a consonant interrupts or stops the flow of air.
  And so in English we have this peculiar situation where consonants have voicedness.
  Voice onset time makes a difference.
  So we are a voice onsetologist if we can find the spaces between words.
  We have large language models traded on images and sounds
  and the feeling of moving around because of inertia and taste and smell.
  The ratbrain is the first to develop and then the batbrain.
  And we'll prove this all in a new upcoming sitcom about biography called Hyperthymesia: The Movie.
  Hear what's up.
