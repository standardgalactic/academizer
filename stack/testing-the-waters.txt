In mathematics, rings are algebraic structures that generalize fields: multiplication need not be commutative and multiplicative inverses need not exist. Informally, a ring is a set equipped with two binary operations satisfying properties analogous to those of addition and multiplication of integers. Ring elements may be numbers such as integers or complex numbers, but they may also be non-numerical objects such as polynomials, square matrices, functions, and power series.

That's correct! In mathematics, a ring is a set of elements equipped with two operations, typically referred to as addition and multiplication, that behave similarly to the operations of addition and multiplication of integers. The concept of a ring is a generalization of the set of integers and is a fundamental structure in abstract algebra.

Here are the basic properties a set needs to have to be considered a ring:

1. The set is closed under addition and multiplication.
2. Addition is associative: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in the set.
3. There is an additive identity (often denoted as 0) such that a + 0 = a for all a in the set.
4. Every element has an additive inverse: for every a in the set, there exists -a in the set such that a + (-a) = 0.
5. Multiplication is associative: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, c in the set.
6. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition: a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c) and (b + c) * a = (b * a) + (c * a) for all a, b, c in the set.

As you noted, unlike with fields, multiplication in a ring is not required to be commutative (though it can be), and multiplicative inverses may not exist for all non-zero elements.

Examples of commutative rings include the set of integers with their standard addition and multiplication, the set of polynomials with their addition and multiplication, the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic variety, and the ring of integers of a number field.

Yes, that's a more formal definition of a ring. In this context:

- An abelian group (or commutative group) under
addition means that the set has an additive identity (usually denoted as 0), every element in the set has an additive inverse, and the operation of addition is both associative and commutative.

- The multiplication operation being associative
means that the order in which operations are performed does not matter: (a * b) * c equals a * (b * c) for any elements a, b, and c in the set.

- Multiplication being distributive over addition
refers to the property that a * (b + c) equals a * b + a * c, and (b + c) * a equals b * a + c * a.

- A multiplicative identity element (often
denoted as 1) is an element that leaves any element of the set unchanged when multiplied by it.

You're also correct that some mathematicians define a ring without the requirement for a multiplicative identity. In cases where the presence of a multiplicative identity is specifically required, the term "ring with unity" or "ring with identity" is often used.

Mecha@gpt-4 4> Whether a ring is commutative has profound implications on its behavior.
Commutative algebra, the theory of commutative rings, is a major branch of ring theory.
Its development has been greatly influenced by problems and ideas of algebraic number th
eory and algebraic geometry. The simplest commutative rings are those that admit divisio
n by non-zero elements; such rings are called fields.

That's right! Commutative rings, where the multiplication operation is commutative (i.e., a * b = b * a for all a and b in the ring), have properties that make them especially interesting and useful in mathematics.

Commutative algebra, the study of commutative rings, is indeed a significant branch of ring theory. It has deep connections with other areas of mathematics like algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.

For instance, in algebraic geometry, commutative rings can be used to define and understand geometric objects, and in algebraic number theory, they can help to solve equations and understand properties of numbers.

As you mentioned, the simplest kind of commutative rings are fields. In a field, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, which means you can "divide" by any non-zero element. Examples of fields include the set of rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. Fields are fundamental in many areas of mathematics and science.

a number field. Examples of noncommutative rings include the ring of n × n real square
matrices with n ≥ 2, group rings in representation theory, operator algebras in function
al analysis, rings of differential operators, and cohomology rings in topology.

Indeed, you've provided great examples of both commutative and noncommutative rings.

Commutative Rings:
1. The set of integers (ℤ), with the standard addition and multiplication.
2. The set of polynomials in one variable over a field, with polynomial addition and multiplication.
3. The coordinate ring of an affine algebraic variety, which is a ring of functions defined on the variety.
4. The ring of integers of a number field, which extends the concept of integers to more general number systems.

Noncommutative Rings:
1. The ring of n × n real square matrices with n ≥ 2. The multiplication of matrices is not commutative.
2. Group rings in representation theory, where elements of a group are represented as linear transformations of a vector space, and these transformations do not necessarily commute.
3. Operator algebras in functional analysis, where the multiplication operation is the composition of operators.
4. Rings of differential operators, where operators are composed to form new operators.
5. Cohomology rings in topology, where the multiplication operation is often the cup product, which is not commutative.

These examples nicely illustrate the broad applicability of the concept of a ring in various branches of mathematics.

Absolutely, the development of the concept of rings was indeed a significant achievement in the history of mathematics.

1. Richard Dedekind, a German mathematician, made substantial contributions to number theory, algebra, and the foundations of the real numbers. His work on "ideals" in number fields laid the groundwork for the formalization of rings.

2. David Hilbert, another German mathematician, contributed to a wide range of fields in mathematics, including algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. His work on polynomial invariants helped shape the concept of a ring.

3. Adolf Fraenkel, a German-Israeli mathematician, made numerous contributions to the field of abstract algebra, including the development of ring theory.

4. Emmy Noether, yet another German mathematician, is often considered the mother of modern algebra. Her work in the early 20th century was fundamental to the establishment of the general theory of rings.

These mathematicians formalized the concept of rings to generalize and unify various mathematical structures and operations found in number theory, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory. Over time, rings have proven to be incredibly versatile and useful in many other areas of mathematics, including geometry, analysis, and topology.

A ring is a set R equipped with two binary operations[a] + (addition) and ⋅ (multiplication) satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the ring axioms[1][2][3]

R is an abelian group under addition, meaning that:
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in R (that is, + is associative).
a + b = b + a for all a, b i
n R (that is, + is commutative).
There is an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a for all a in R (that is, 0 is the additive identity).
For each a in R there exists −a in R such that a + (−a) = 0 (that is, −a is the additive inverse of a).
R is a monoid under multiplication, meaning that:
(a · b) · c = a · (b · c) for all a, b, c in R (that is, ⋅ is associative).
There is an element 1 in R such that a · 1 = a and 1 · a = a for all a in R (that is, 1 is the multiplicative identity).[b]
Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, meaning that:
a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) for all a, b, c in R (left distributivity).
(b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a) for all a, b, c in R (right distributivity).
In notation, the multiplication symbol · is often omitted, in which case a · b is written as ab.
/end

Yes, you've correctly listed the three sets of axioms that define a ring. To summarize:

1. A ring is an abelian group under addition. This means it has an additive identity (usually denoted as 0), every element has an additive inverse, addition is associative, and addition is commutative.

2. A ring is a monoid under multiplication. This means that multiplication is associative and there is a multiplicative identity (usually denoted as 1). Note that unlike in a group, not every element has to have a multiplicative inverse.

3. Multiplication is distributive over addition. This property is what allows us to expand expressions like a(b + c) into ab + ac.

These axioms are central to the structure of a ring and provide the basis for many of the properties and results in ring theory. And, as you mentioned, in most contexts the multiplication symbol is omitted, so the product of a and b is simply written as ab.

Mecha@gpt-4 8> Could you be more specific about how to understand the notation with exam
ples?

Certainly! Let's go through each axiom with an example. We'll use the set of integers, ℤ, as our ring for these examples since it's a familiar set that follows the rules of a ring.

**Abelian Group under Addition:**
1. Associative addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
Example: Let's say a is 1, b is 2, and c is 3. Then (1 + 2) + 3 = 6 and 1 + (2 + 3) = 6. Both sides are equal, so addition is associative.

2. Commutative addition: a + b = b + a
Example: Let's say a is 2 and b is 3. Then 2 + 3 = 5 and 3 + 2 = 5. Both sides are equal, so addition is commutative.

3. Additive identity: there is an element 0 such that a + 0 = a
Example: Let's say a is 4. Then 4 + 0 = 4.

4. Additive inverse: for each a, there exists -a such that a + (-a) = 0
Example: Let's say a is 5. Then 5 + (-5) = 0.

**Monoid under Multiplication:**
1. Associative multiplication: (a ⋅ b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ (b ⋅ c)
Example: Let's say a is 2, b is 3, and c is 4. Then (2 ⋅ 3) ⋅ 4 = 24 and 2 ⋅ (3 ⋅ 4) = 24. Both sides are equal, so multiplication is associative.

2. Multiplicative identity: there is an element 1 such that a ⋅ 1 = a and 1 ⋅ a = a
Example: Let's say a is 5. Then 5 ⋅ 1 = 5 and 1 ⋅ 5 = 5.

**Distributive Laws:**
1. Left distributivity: a ⋅ (b + c) = (a ⋅ b) + (a ⋅ c)
Example: Let's say a is 2, b is 3, and c is 4. Then 2 ⋅ (3 + 4) = 14 and (2 ⋅ 3) + (2 ⋅ 4) = 14. Both sides are equal, so the operation is left distributive.

2. Right distributivity: (b + c) ⋅ a = (b ⋅ a) + (c ⋅ a)
Example: Let's say a is 2, b is 3, and c is 4. Then (3 + 4) ⋅ 2 = 14 and (3 ⋅ 2) + (4 ⋅ 2) = 14. Both sides are equal, so the operation is right distributive.

Remember that while we've used integers here, these rules apply to any set that fulfills the axioms and can thus be considered a ring, including sets of matrices, functions, polynomials, and more.
