Awesome conversation. I admit that I might have fell asleep at some point because I was watching it at 2 am, I might have to go back and see if I missed anything.. I know they would probably horrible, but I would still like to see the automatic captioning, I don't know if it could be enabled after the fact... I would definitely read any book that you  wrote on go.  Let me see if I can think of some titles:

Question Everything: A beginner's guide to Go
Using Golang to get things done.
Asking the right questions in Lynxspace
New Sparseland
Teach through Learning. Literate Programming in a Nutshell
Understanding Go Philosophy
Managing Expectations while Learning Computer Algorithms and other Escalating Arms-Races

Solving all of the world's problems using Go (along with Julia, Python, and R)
Ontological Quandaries
Using Vim is not Optional!
Playing with your Multiplexer.
