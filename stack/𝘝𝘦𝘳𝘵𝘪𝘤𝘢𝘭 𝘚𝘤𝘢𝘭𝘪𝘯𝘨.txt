You're married to those guys
All humanity's next thousand-year plateau due itself
Ambitious and practicality, we start modestly enough with a hurry
Because harnessing the geonic fury of hurricanes
Is obviously the low-hanging fruit of renewable energy
This ingenious device employs falsorial pediments
A term that undoubtedly makes perfect sense
To weave parachutes and cables from giant kelp
Yes, giant kelp nature's go-to material for withstanding extreme weather
These kelp-crafted models deploy during storms to wind up generators
Dissipating energy into gravitational batteries
But its dreams reliability like a power system
Dependent on both hurricanes and seaweed
Progressing naturally, the Vulsoria evolved
Into global orthodromic freshwater rivers
Supported by pediments in the next phase
It's about time we tackled the trivial task
Of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution
These rivers, the force will be perfectly maintained
And free of any ecological consequences
In the third act of this epic
The intervulsorial pediments conveniently double
As landing hubs for nested Hoberman space elevators
Repurposing a child's expanding sphere
Toy into space elevator technology
Is a stroke of genius that surely won't backfire
After all, what could go wrong
With telescoping structures reaching into space?
Not stopping there, we retrofit the orthodromes with geothermal mass accelerators
Because tapping into the Earth's geothermal energy
To accelerate masses is a walk in the park
Meanwhile, the space elevators now house extendable linear orbital railgun ring tunnels
Launching payloads via massive railguns embedded in space elevators
Sounds perfectly safe and efficient
Disregarding minor details like physics and material science limitations
Finally, the gesture resistance
Circling dice and ring gravitational slingshot
Assessed railgun
The key shields inside mercury's orbit
Coving colossal structures in the scorching vicinity of the sun
The slingshot objects cross the source of the mist
As the first is the obvious next step
This is the obvious next step
The first is the obvious next step
The interstellar travel is routine as a morning commute
In summary, a grandiose vision is a testament to humanity's unyielding optimism
An occasional detachment from reality
By piling one hypothetical technology atop another
We're surely painting the way to a future
Where complexity knows no bounds
And practicality takes a well to Theropradi's feasibility
When we have imagination
Progressing naturally, the Vulsoria evolves into global orthodromic freshwater rivers supported by Penevins in the next phase
It's about time we tackle the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution
Who needs feasibility like we have imagination
Go for��는 boat
That's not coming
There is nothing
But urge us to take the albo
There is nothing
