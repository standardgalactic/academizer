PRAISE FOR THE 
PSYCHOLOGY OF 
TOTALITARIANISM 
“As I walk through the halls 
of a major US medical center, I 
see eyes that 
divert themselves away from 
me as I pass. When we engage in 
our usual 
discussions on patients, the 
topic of COVID-19 vaccination 
brings a 
halting response: ‘We don’t 
want to talk about it.’ I see 
fear, shame, and a 

never-ending cycle of 
groupthink that has been more 
contagious among 
physicians than aerosolized 
SARS-CoV-2 in a crowded 
elevator. Mattias 
Desmet, like a guided missile, 
has hit the target. The 
medical community is 
in mass formation and this led 
to a much larger penumbra 
that has 
enveloped the general 
population. In this book, Desmet
has constructed an 

explanatory framework from 
which the cohesive fabric is 
suspended that 
clearly and concisely explains 
what is happening and what the
next steps 
are that each and every one 
of us need to take to break 
the ‘spell’ and 
restore normalcy. A must read 
for our time.” 
—PETER A. MCCULLOUGH, MD, 
MPH; chief medical advisor, 
Truth 
for Health Foundation 

“Transcending medical 
controversies, this book 
offers an indispensable 
window into the social 
phenomenon we call COVID.” 
—CHARLES EISENSTEIN, author 
of Sacred Economics and The 
Coronation 
“Mattias Desmet is the 
world’s expert on the 
phenomenon of mass 
formation—and one of the most
sincere, thoughtful, and 
important 
intellectuals of the twenty-
first century. If you want to 

understand why andhow the 
coronavirus pandemic response 
unfolded the way it did at a 
societal level and—even more 
importantly—how to prevent 
such a 
travesty from happening again, 
The Psychology of 
Totalitarianism is 
essential reading. Desmet 
shows us how to reclaim our 
humanity in an 
increasingly dehumanized and 
mechanized world.” 

—DR. REINER FUELLMICH, trial
attorney; cofounder, Berlin’s
Corona 
Investigative Committee 
“In this masterful book, 
Desmet asks how we have 
arrived at the doorstep 
of totalitarianism. Taking the 
reader on a wild, scholarly 
ride through 
history, science, and 
psychology, he delivers 
answers both necessary and 
unexpected.” 

—HEATHER HEYING, PhD, 
evolutionary biologist; 
coauthor of A 
Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to 
the 21st Century 
“Desmet is waking a lot of 
people up to the dangerous 
place we are now 
with a brilliant distillation of 
how we ended up here.” 
—ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. 
“Mattias Desmet’s theory of 
mass formation is the most 
important lens 

through which we can 
understand the COVID-19 
pandemic and the social 
aberrations that accompanied 
it. In The Psychology of 
Totalitarianism, 
Desmet explains how and why 
people will willingly give up 
their freedom, 
how the masses can give rise to
a totalitarian leader, and—
most 
importantly—how we can resist 
these phenomena and maintain 
our 

common humanity. This is the 
most important book of 2022.” 
—DR. ROBERT MALONE, author
of Lies My Gov’t Told Me 
“Mattias Desmet’s [theory of
mass formation hypnosis] is 
great.… Once I 
kind of started to look for it, 
I saw it everywhere.”

NotesIntroduction 
To write a book about 
totalitarianism—the idea first 
occurred to me on 
November 4, 2017. Or rather, 
it first appeared then in my 
scientific diary, a 

notebook I use to scribble down 
anything that might be useful 
for a later 
article or book. 
At the time, I was staying at a 
chalet in the Ardennes, owned
by a 
couple of friends. In the early
morning hours, as the rising 
sun illuminated 
the surrounding woods, I 
opened my diary to write down 
thoughts that had 
spun during the night. Perhaps 
it was the peace and quiet of 
the natural 

environment that made me 
more sensitive than usual, but 
on that November 
morning, I was gripped by the 
palpable and acute awareness 
of a new 
totalitarianism that had left 
its seed and made the fabric of
society stiffen. 
Even by 2017, it could no 
longer be denied: The grip of 
governments on 
private life was growing 
tremendously fast. We were 
experiencing an 

erosion of the right to privacy 
(especially since 9/11), 
alternative voices 
were increasingly censored and
suppressed (particularly in 
the context of 
the climate debate), the 
number of intrusive actions by 
security forces was 
rising dramatically, and more. 
It was not only governments 
behind these developments, 
however. The 
rapid emergence of “woke” 
culture and the growing 
climate movement was 

giving rise to the call for a 
new, hyper-strict government 
that emerged from 
within the population itself. 
Terrorists, climate changes, 
heterosexual men, 
and, later, viruses were 
considered too dangerous to be 
tackled with old
fashioned means. The 
technological “tracking and 
tracing” of populations 
became increasingly acceptable 
and was even deemed 
necessary. 

The dystopian vision of the 
German-Jewish philosopher 
Hannah Arendt 
loomed at society’s horizon: 
the emergence of a new 
totalitarianism, no 
longer led by flamboyant “mob 
leaders” such as Joseph Stalin 
or Adolf 
Hitler but by dull bureaucrats
and technocrats.That 
November morning, I drafted 
the blueprint for a book in 
which I 

would explore the 
psychological roots of 
totalitarianism. At the time, I 
wondered: Why did 
totalitarianism as a form of 
statehood emerge for the 
first time in the first half of
the twentieth century? And 
moreover: What is 
the difference between it and
the classical dictatorships of 
the past? The 
essence of this difference, I 
realized, lies within the field 
of psychology. 

Dictatorships are based on a 
primitive psychological 
mechanism, 
namely on the creation of a 
climate of fear amongst the 
population, based 
on the brutal potential of the
dictatorial regime. 
Totalitarianism, on the other 
hand, has its roots in the 
insidious psychological process 
of mass formation. 
Only a thorough analysis of 
this process enables us to 
understand the 

shocking behaviors of a 
“totalitarized” population, 
including an exaggerated 
willingness of individuals to 
sacrifice their own personal 
interests out of 
solidarity with the collective 
(i.e., the masses), a profound 
intolerance of 
dissident voices, and 
pronounced susceptibility to 
pseudo-scientific 
indoctrination and propaganda. 
Mass formation is, in essence, a
kind of group hypnosis that 
destroys 

individuals’ ethical self-
awareness and robs them of 
their ability to think 
critically. This process is 
insidious in nature; populations
fall prey to it 
unsuspectingly. To put it in 
the words of Yuval Noah 
Harari: Most people 
wouldn’t even notice the 
shift toward a totalitarian 
regime. We associate 
totalitarianism mainly with 
labor, concentration, and 
extermination camps, 

but those are merely the 
final, bewildering stage of a 
long process. 
* * * 
In the months and years after 
I made these initial notes, more
and more 
references to totalitarianism 
appeared in my diary. They 
spun into longer 
and longer threads that 
organically connected with 
other areas of my 
academic interests. For 
example, the psychological 
problem of 

totalitarianism touched upon a 
crisis that had erupted in the 
scientific world 
in 2005, a theme that I 
explored extensively in my 
doctoral dissertation. 
Sloppiness, errors, biased 
conclusions, and even outright 
fraud had become 
so prevalent in scientific 
research that a staggeringly 
high percentage of 
research papers—up to 85 
percent in some fields—
reached radically wrong 

conclusions. And the most 
fascinating thing of all, from a
psychologicalpoint of view: Most
researchers were utterly 
convinced they were 
conducting their research more
or less correctly. Somehow, 
they failed to 
realize that their research 
was not bringing them closer to 
the facts but 
instead was creating a 
fictitious new reality. 
This, of course, is a serious 
problem, especially for 
contemporary 

societies that place their faith
in science as the most reliable 
way of 
understanding the world. 
Furthermore, the foregoing 
problem is directly 
related to the phenomenon of 
totalitarianism. In fact, this is 
precisely what 
Arendt exposes: The 
undercurrent of 
totalitarianism consists of blind
belief 
in a kind of statistical-
numerical “scientific fiction” 
that shows “radical 

contempt for facts”: “The 
ideal subject of totalitarian 
rule is not the 
convinced Nazi or the convinced
Communist, but people for 
whom the 
distinction between fact and 
fiction and the distinction 
between true and 
false no longer exist.”1 
The poor quality of scientific 
research reveals a more 
fundamental 
problem: Our scientific 
worldview has substantial 
shortcomings, the 

consequences of which extend 
far beyond the field of 
academic research. 
These shortcomings are also 
the origin of a profound 
collective unease, 
which, in recent decades, has 
become increasingly palpable in 
our society. 
People’s view of the future 
is now tainted with pessimism 
and lack of 
perspective, more so everyday.
Should civilization not be 
washed away by 

rising sea levels, then it 
certainly will be swept away by
refugees. The 
Grand Narrative of society—the
story of the Enlightenment—
no longer 
leads to the optimism and 
positivism of yesteryear, to 
put it mildly. Much of 
the population is trapped in 
almost complete social isolation;
we see a 
remarkable increase in 
absenteeism due to mental 
suffering; an 

unprecedented proliferation 
in the use of psychotropic 
drugs; a burnout 
epidemic that paralyzes entire 
companies and government 
institutions. 
In 2019, this predicament was 
clearly perceptible in my own 
professional environment. I saw
so many colleagues around me 
drop out 
from work due to psychological 
problems, hindering the 
capacity to 

perform even basic day-to-day
work. For example, that year, 
it took me 
nearly nine months to obtain a 
signature on a contract that 
was required for 
me to get started on a 
research project. The 
university departments that 
had 
to review the contract and 
grant their approval were 
dealing with so much 
absenteeism that there was 
always someone on sick leave 
due to mentalsuffering, so 

that the contract simply 
didn’t get finalized. During 
that 
period, all social stress 
indicators rose exponentially. 
Anyone familiar with 
systems theory knows what 
this means: The system is 
heading for a tipping 
point. It is on the verge of 
reorganizing itself and seeking 
a new 
equilibrium. 
At the end of December 2019—
in the same Ardennes chalet I 

mentioned earlier—I ventured 
to make a small prediction in 
the company of 
friends: One of these days, we
will wake up in a different 
society. This 
intuitive premonition even 
enticed me to take action. A 
few days later, I 
went to the bank to pay off 
the mortgage on my house. 
Whether or not that 
was a wise thing to do depends 
entirely on your perspective. 
Maybe it 

wasn’t wise from a purely 
economic or tax point of view, 
but that was of no 
concern to me. First and 
foremost, I wanted my 
sovereignty back; I did not 
want to feel indebted to and 
complicit in a financial system 
that, in my 
view, played a part in the 
social impasse that was about to
occur. The bank 
manager listened to my story; 
he even agreed with me. But 
he insisted on 

knowing why I felt so 
determined about it. Even 
after we spoke for an hour 
and a half, it wasn’t enough 
to fill the emptiness of his 
question. I ended up 
leaving him wondering, well 
past the closing time of his 
branch office, 
which was to be shut down 
forever shortly thereafter. 
* * * 
A few months later—in 
February 2020—the global 
village began to shake 

on its foundations. The world 
was presented with a 
foreboding crisis, the 
consequences of which were 
incalculable. In a matter of 
weeks, everyone 
was gripped by the story of a 
virus—a story that was 
undoubtedly based on 
facts. But on which ones? We 
caught a first glimpse of “the 
facts” via 
footage from China. A virus 
forced the Chinese 
government to take the 

most draconian measures. 
Entire cities were 
quarantined, new hospitals 
were built hastily, and 
individuals in white suits 
disinfected public spaces. 
Here and there, rumors 
emerged that the totalitarian 
Chinese government 
was overreacting and that the 
new virus was no worse than 
the flu. Opposite 
opinions were also floating 
around: that it must be much 
worse than it 

looked, because otherwise no 
government would take such 
radical 
measures. At that point, 
everything still felt far 
removed from our shoresand 
we assumed that the story did 
not allow us to gauge the full 
extent of 
the facts. 
Until the moment that the 
virus arrived in Europe. We 
now began 
recording infections and 
deaths for ourselves. We saw 
images of 

overcrowded emergency rooms 
in Italy, convoys of army 
vehicles 
transporting corpses, morgues 
full of coffins. The renowned
scientists at 
Imperial College confidently 
predicted that without the 
most drastic 
measures, the virus would 
claim tens of millions of lives. 
In Bergamo, 
sirens blared day and night, 
silencing any voice in public 
space that dared to 

doubt the facts. From then 
on, story and facts seemed to 
merge and 
uncertainty gave way to 
certainty. 
The unimaginable became 
reality: We witnessed the 
abrupt pivot of 
nearly every country on 
Earth to follow China’s 
example and place huge 
populations of people under de
facto house arrest, a situation
for which the 

term “lockdown” was devised. 
A surreal silence descended— 
ominous and 
liberating at the same time. 
The sky without airplanes, 
traffic arteries 
without rushing blood; the 
dust of chasing vain desires 
settling down, and in 
India, the air became so pure 
that, for the first time in 
thirty years, in some 
places the Himalayas became 
once more visible against the 
horizon.2 

It didn’t stop there. We also 
saw a remarkable transfer of 
power. Expert 
virologists were called upon as 
George Orwell’s pigs—the 
smartest animals 
on the farm—to replace the 
unreliable politicians. They 
would run the 
animal farm with accurate 
(“scientific”) information in a 
time of plague. 
But these experts soon 
turned out to have quite a 
few common, human 

flaws. In their statistics and 
graphs, they made mistakes 
that even 
“ordinary” people would not 
easily make. It went so far 
that, at one point, 
they counted all deaths as 
coronavirus deaths, including 
people who had 
died of, say, heart attacks. 
Nor did they live up to their 
promises. These experts 
pledged that the 
Gates to Freedom would reopen
after two doses of the 
vaccine, but when 

the time came, things didn’t 
change and they came up with 
the need for a 
third. And just like Orwell’s 
pigs, they sometimes changed 
the rules 
overnight, inconspicuously. 
First, the animals had to 
comply with the 
measures because the number 
of sick people could not exceed
the capacity 
of the health care system 
(flatten the curve). But one 
day, everyone woke up 

to discover writing on the 
walls stating that the 
measures were beingextended 
because the virus had to be 
eradicated (crush the curve). 
Eventually, the rules changed
so often that only the pigs 
seemed to know 
them. And even that was not 
so sure. 
Some people became suspicious. 
How is it possible that these 
experts 
make mistakes that even 
laymen wouldn’t make? 
Aren’t they scientists, the 

kind of people who took us to 
the moon and gave us the 
internet? They 
can’t be that stupid, can 
they? What is the endgame? 
Their 
recommendations take us 
further down the road in the 
same direction: With 
each new step, we lose more of
our freedoms, until we reach a
final 
destination where human beings
are reduced to QR codes in a 
large 

technocratic medical 
experiment. 
That’s how most people 
eventually became certain. 
Very certain. Yet of 
the most opposing things. Some 
people were convinced that we 
were 
dealing with a killer virus, 
others that it was nothing 
more than the seasonal 
flu, and still others believed 
that the virus did not even 
exist and that we 

were dealing with a worldwide 
conspiracy. And there were 
also a few who 
continued to tolerate 
uncertainty and kept asking 
themselves: How can we 
adequately understand what is
going on in our society? 
* * * 
The coronavirus crisis did not 
come out of the blue. It fits 
into a series of 
increasingly desperate and 
self-destructive societal 
responses to objects of 

fear: terrorists, global 
warming, coronavirus. 
Whenever a new object of fear
arises in society, there is only 
one response and one defense 
in our current 
way of thinking: increased 
control. The fact that the 
human being can 
tolerate only a certain amount
of control is completely 
overlooked. 
Coercive control leads to fear 
and fear leads to more 
coercive control. Just 

like that, society falls victim 
to a vicious circle that 
inevitably leads to 
totalitarianism, which means to 
extreme government control, 
eventually 
resulting in the radical 
destruction of both the 
psychological and physical 
integrity of human beings. 
We have to consider the 
current fear and psychological
discomfort to be 
a problem in itself, a problem 
that cannot be reduced to a 
virus or any other 

“object of threat.” Our fear 
originates on a completely 
different level—that 
of the failure of the Grand 
Narrative of our society. This 
is the narrative ofmechanistic 
science, in which man is 
reduced to a biological 
organism. A 
narrative that ignores the 
psychological, symbolic, and 
ethical dimensions 
of human beings and thereby 
has a devastating effect at 
the level of human 

relationships. Something in this
narrative causes man to become
isolated 
from his fellow man, and from 
nature; something in it causes 
man to stop 
resonating with the world 
around him; something in it 
turns the human 
being into an atomized subject. 
It is precisely this atomized 
subject that, 
according to Arendt, is the 
elementary building block of 
the totalitarian 
state. 

Totalitarianism is not a 
historical coincidence. In the 
final analysis, it is 
the logical consequence of 
mechanistic thinking and the 
delusional belief in 
the omnipotence of human 
rationality. As such, 
totalitarianism is the 
defining feature of the 
Enlightenment tradition. 
Several authors have 
postulated this, but it hasn’t 
yet been subject to a 
psychological analysis. 

This book fills that gap. We 
will analyze the symptom of 
totalitarianism and 
situate it within the broader 
context of the social 
phenomena of which it 
forms a part. 
Part 1 (chapters 1 to 5) covers 
how the mechanist–materialist 
view of 
man and the world creates the
specific social-psychological 
conditions in 
which mass formation and 
totalitarianism thrive. Part 2 
(chapters 6 to 8) 

details the process of mass 
formation and its relationship 
to totalitarianism. 
Finally, part 3 (chapters 9 to 
11) investigates a way to 
transcend the current 
condition of man and the 
world, so as to render 
totalitarianism superfluous. 
As a matter of fact, part 1 and 
part 3 of this book only 
marginally refer to 
totalitarianism. It is not my aim 
with this book to focus on that
which is 
usually 

associated 
with 
totalitarianism—concentration 
camps, 
indoctrination, propaganda—but 
rather the broader cultural-
historical 
processes from which 
totalitarianism emerges. This 
approach allows us to 
focus on what matters most: 
Totalitarianism arises from 
evolutions and 
tendencies that take place in 
our day-to-day lives. 

Ultimately, this book explores 
the possibilities of finding a 
way out of 
the current cultural impasse 
in which we appear to be stuck.
The escalating 
social crises of the early 
twenty-first century are the 
manifestation of an 
underlying psychological and 
ideological upheaval—a shift of
the tectonic 
plates on which a worldview 
rests. We are experiencing the
moment in 

which an old ideology rears up 
in power, one last time, before
collapsing.Each attempt to 
remediate the current social 
problems, whatever they may 
be, on the basis of the old 
ideology will only make things 
worse. One 
cannot solve a problem using 
the same mindset that created 
it. The solution 
to our fear and uncertainty 
does not lie in the increase of 
(technological) 

control. The real task facing 
us as individuals and as a 
society is to 
construct a new view of man 
and the world, to find a new 
foundation for 
our identity, to formulate new
principles for living together 
with others, and 
to reappraise a timely human 
capacity—speaking the 
truth.PART I 
SCIENCE AND ITS 
PSYCHOLOGICAL 
EFFECTSCHAPTER 1 
Science and Ideology 

It is a summer day in 1582. A 
young student by the name of 
Galileo Galilei 
sits in the cathedral of Pisa. 
Before him stands a priest, 
reciting scripture. A 
chandelier attached to the 
vaulted ceiling by a thin chain 
hangs over the 
priest’s head. The warm 
summer breeze blows in 
through the open doors, 
setting the chandelier in 
motion. Sometimes, the breeze 
swings the lamp far 

from its resting place above 
the altar; other times it moves
it only a little bit. 
The priest’s voice disappears 
into the background. Galileo’s 
eyes follow the 
lamp—back and forth, back and 
forth. He checks his pulse and
counts the 
number of heartbeats. 
Regardless of how far it 
swings, the pendulum 
always takes the same amount 
of time to return to its 
starting point. 

The events in the cathedral 
of Pisa later took on mythical 
proportions, 
embodying the cultural and 
social upheaval that 
characterized the centuries 
that followed. Religious 
discourse, with its system of 
dogmas derived from 
ancient texts, lost its 
authority. Instead of something
that had to be revealed 
to man by God, knowledge 
became something man could 
come to on his 

own. All he had to do was 
observe phenomena with his 
eyes and think 
logically. 
Religious discourse had turned
man’s gaze inward for 
thousands of 
years, revolving around the 
conception of man as a sinner, 
who lies and 
deceives and loses himself in 
worldly temptations, who must 
ready himself 
for death because it will catch
up with him eventually. If man
suffered in 

this world, the creation of 
God, it was because he failed 
to measure up as a 
moral and ethical being, 
because he was living in sin. It 
was not the world 
that had to be questioned but 
man himself. 
That all changed with the 
emergence of science: Man 
believed that, with 
the power of reason, he could 
adjust the world, while he 
himself couldremain 
unchanged. He gathered his 

courage and took charge of his 
destiny: 
He would use his own 
intellectual power to 
understand the world and to 
shape a new, rational society. 
For too long, he had been 
forced to remain 
silent in the name of a God no 
one had ever seen; for too 
long, society had 
been burdened by dogmas that 
lacked any rational foundation.
The time had 

come to dispel the darkness 
with the light of reason. 
“Enlightenment is 
man’s release from his self-
incurred tutelage. Tutelage is 
man’s inability to 
make use of his understanding 
without direction from another
… ‘Dare to 
think! Have the courage to use
your own reason!’ is 
therefore the motto of 
the Enlightenment,” as stated
in 1784 by the great German 
Enlightenment 
philosopher Immanuel Kant.1 

Galileo dared—to think. After 
Mass, he rushed to his dorm 
room and 
began experimenting with 
pendulums: He altered the 
weight of the 
swinging object, the force with 
which the object was put into 
motion, the 
length of chain by which the 
object was suspended. Only a 
few months 
later, he was able to 
formulate the basic law 
governing pendulum motion: 

Only the length the chain 
(the pendulum arm) has an 
impact on the duration 
of motion. 
Other brilliant thinkers, such 
as Nicolaus Copernicus and Isaac 
Newton, 
also pulled the dogmatic wool 
from their eyes to register 
the world around 
them with an open mind. They 
demonstrated that certain 
aspects of reality 
could be captured in 
mathematical and mechanistic 
formulas with 

incredible accuracy and 
precision. It seemed 
incontrovertible: The book of 
the universe is written in the 
language of mathematics. 
These thinkers not only 
reached great intellectual 
achievements, they 
also assumed a unique 
humanistic and ethical stance 
with regard to the 
world and its material objects. 
They had the courage to set 
aside the 

prejudices and dogmas of the 
time. They admitted their 
ignorance and were 
curious and open to what 
phenomena have to say for 
themselves. This “not 
knowing” gave birth to a new 
knowledge, a new knowledge 
for which they 
would do anything, for which 
they were willing to give up 
their freedom, 
sometimes even their lives. 
This newborn science—this 
budding knowledge—showed all 
the 

characteristics of what the 
French philosopher Michel 
Foucault defines as 
truth-telling. 2 Truth-
telling is a way of speaking 
that breaks through an 
established, if implicit, social 
consensus. Whoever speaks the
truth breaksopen the 
solidified story in which the 
group seeks refuge, ease, and 
security. 
This makes speaking the truth 
a dangerous endeavor. It 
strikes fear in the 

group, and results in anger and
aggression. 
Truth-telling is dangerous. 
Yet it is also necessary. No 
matter how 
fruitful a social consensus may
be at a certain time, if it is not
dismantled in 
time and renewed, it will 
putrefy and eventually have 
a suffocating impact 
on society. In such times, the 
truth will emerge as a sincere 
voice that 

breaks through the dull 
refrain of an established 
story and lends a new 
sound to old and ageless words.
“Le vraie est toujours neuf” 
(Truth is 
always new) (Max Jacob).3 
Science can, in essence, be 
defined as open-mindedness. 
The original 
practice of science, that which 
formed the basis of the 
Enlightenment, 
briefly suspended prejudice 
about the things being 
observed. It was open to 

the greatest possible diversity
of ideas and thoughts, 
assumptions, and 
hypotheses. It cultivated 
doubt and considered 
uncertainty a virtue. It let 
the 
facts speak for themselves 
and decide for themselves 
what kind of thought 
or theory they preferred to 
unite with. In this way, facts 
were reborn into 
words as fresh, budding 
truths. 

It was not only the facts that 
had the liberty to assert 
themselves. “I may 
disagree with what you say, but
I will defend to the death 
your right to say 
it,” Voltaire declared (or 
rather, his biographer Evelyn 
Beatrice Hall, 
declared). Science also 
liberated man from his self-
incurred immaturity. It 
broke through rule by 
religious dogma that, in the 
public sphere, had largely 

decayed into coercion and 
oppression, pretense and 
hypocrisy, deceit and 
lies. 
This open-mindedness bore 
abundant fruit. The scientific 
method was 
used to understand and 
predict the movement of the 
celestial bodies, to 
describe pendulums and 
calculate gravitational 
acceleration, and also to 
study the behavior of animals, 
to understand how the mind 
works, to map 

the structure of languages, to
compare cultures with one 
another. It could be 
flexibly adapted to every 
domain of inquiry, every object
of research, and it 
brought forth sublime 
discoveries in every field. 
Shapes and colors were 
delineated sharper than ever 
in science’s light; sounds 
sounded clearer than 
ears had ever heard. 
This openness of mind, this 
faithful pursuit of Reason at 
any cost 

eventually yielded, through 
incessant endeavor over 
several centuries, themost 
sublime insights. Surprising 
insights, too. The great 
physicists of the 
first half of the twentieth 
century proved in the most 
rigorous way that the 
core of matter cannot be 
separated from the observing 
subject. They 
demonstrated that the 
observation of a material 
object changes the object 

itself (“Looking at something, 
changes it,” Erwin Schrödinger
declared). 
Moreover, they relinquished 
the illusion that man could 
ever attain 
certainty. With his uncertainty
principle, Werner Heisenberg 
demonstrated 
that it is impossible to 
unambiguously determine even 
purely material 
“facts,” such as the location 
in time and space of material 
particles.4 The 

great minds who followed 
reason and facts most 
rigorously came to the 
conclusion that, ultimately, 
the essence of things is beyond
logic and cannot 
be grasped. Niels Bohr 
concluded that only poetry can
describe the absurd 
behavior of elementary 
particles: “When it comes to 
atoms, language can 
only be used as poetry.” 
Also the very idea of 
predictability in the material 
world—fanatically 

proclaimed by French scientist 
Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 
eighteenth 
century—was invalidated by 
the American mathematician and
meteorologist Edward Lorenz in
the twentieth century. Even 
if you’re able 
to capture a complex and 
dynamic phenomenon (which 
includes most 
natural phenomena) in 
mathematical formulas, you 
still, even with formulas 

in hand, wouldn’t be able to 
predict their behavior a second
in advance. 
And finally, the image of the 
universe as a dead and 
nondirectional 
(nonteleological) mechanical 
process also proved 
scientifically untenable. 
Chaos theory showed in a truly
revolutionary way that matter
is constantly 
organizing itself in ways that 
cannot possibly be explained in 
mechanistic 

terms. The universe is 
endowed with direction and 
volition. We’ll explore 
this more in detail in the last 
part of this book. 
Newton had already stated as 
much in the seventeenth 
century: The 
laws of mechanics apply to only
a very limited part of reality. 
As science 
progressed, this only became 
clearer—at least, for those 
who had eyes to 
see it. In the twentieth 
century, the great 

mathematician René Thom put 
it 
this way: “That portion of 
reality, which can be well 
described by laws 
which permit calculations, is 
extremely limited.” He 
continued, even more 
importantly, “All major 
theoretical advances, in my 
opinion, have arisen 
from the capacity of their 
inventors to ‘get into the skin
of things,’ to be 
able to empathize with all 
entities of the external 

world. It is this kind 
ofidentification that 
transforms an objective 
phenomenon into a concrete 
thought experiment.”5 
This sheds surprising light on 
the nature of science. Most 
are of the 
opinion that science consists of 
making dry, logical connections 
between 
“objectively” observable 
facts. However, science is, in 
fact, characterized 

by empathy, a resonant 
affinity between the observer
and the phenomenon 
under investigation. As such, 
science stumbles upon an 
unknowable and 
mysterious essence that 
escapes logical explanation and 
which can be 
described only in the language 
of poetry and metaphor. 
Encounters with that essence 
often result in what we might 
describe as 

the seminal religious 
experience—a religious 
experience that precedes and 
is untainted by religious 
institutions or dogma. Max 
Planck testified to that 
experience, in perhaps the 
most direct and vulnerable 
way: Science 
eventually arrives where 
religion once started, in a 
personal contact with the 
Unnameable (see also chapter 
11). 

Based on this experience, the 
physicists of the twentieth 
century 
reappraised the great religious
and mystical writings, such as 
the 
Upanishads. The content and 
structure of those texts, the
imagery and the 
symbolism, offer a better grip 
on reality than any logical, 
rational discourse. 
Science freed itself from all 
the dogmas of religious 
discourse, only to 

rediscover—at the end of a 
long journey—the mystical and 
religious texts 
and reendow them with their 
resplendent, original status: 
symbolic, 
metaphorical texts for that 
which is eternally hidden from
the human mind. 
As we will discuss in the 
latter part of this book, the 
faithful pursuit of 
Reason attained the highest 
and most sublime achievement: 
mapping its 

own boundaries. The human 
mind had accepted its own 
limitations and 
once more relocated the 
ultimate knowledge beyond and
outside itself. The 
ultimate achievement of 
science is that it finally 
surrenders, that it comes to 
the realization that it cannot 
be the guiding principle for 
man. It is not 
human reason that is at the 
heart of the matter, but man 
as an individual 

who makes ethical and moral 
choices, man in relation to 
fellow man, man 
in relation to the unnameable, 
which, at the heart of things, 
speaks to him. 
* * *However, from the 
beginning, the tree of science 
also sprouted a branch in 
another direction—the exact 
opposite direction of that 
original scientific 
practice. Based on the great 
achievements of science, some 
people tipped 

from open-mindedness to 
belief; for them, science 
became ideology. It was 
mainly the mechanistic-
materialistic branch, the so-
called hard sciences, 
that most enraptured us. 
Simple in its principles (the 
laws of mechanics), 
specific in its object (the 
tangible, visible world), and 
awe-inspiring in its 
practical applicability (from 
the steam engine to television 
and the atomic 

bomb to the Internet), this 
science has everything to 
seduce human beings. 
With this branch of science, 
man conquers space; it enables 
us to see and 
hear what is happening on the 
other side of the planet and 
visualize brain 
activity; it gives us the ability 
to move faster than sound and
to perform 
microsurgical procedures. In 
the past, people waited in vain 
for God to 

perform miracles, but this 
science made them actually 
happen. Man had left 
the stage of believing and 
could now rely successfully on
what he knew. At 
least, so he believed. 
From the Enlightenment 
forward, mechanistic thinking 
provided the 
Grand Narrative in Western 
civilization. According to that 
story, it begins 
with a big bang that sets an 
expanding universe in motion, 
generating a 

series of phenomena of growing
complexity. Hydrogen is formed
first, then 
helium, and then all the 
other elements through 
alternating processes of 
fusion and explosion. The 
elements clump together and 
form stars and 
planets and one of them, the 
Earth, contains water. This 
water allows for the 
formation of amino acids, often
regarded as the first form of 
life. From 

here, guided by natural 
selection, simple forms of life
gradually give way to 
more complex forms until, at 
long last, man emerges—the 
provisional end 
point of evolution. In this way, 
the scientific discourse spun 
its own creation 
myth. 
From this perspective, the 
entirety of human subjectivity
becomes an 
insignificant by-product of 
mechanistic processes. 

Man may not realize it, but his 
humanity does not really 
matter, it is nothing essential.
His whole existence, his 
longing and his lust, his 
romantic lamentations and his 
most superficial needs, his joy 
and his sorrow, his doubt 
and his choices, his anger and 
unreasonableness, hispleasure
and his suffering, his deepest 
aversion and his 
most lofty aesthetic 
appreciations, in short, the 
entire
