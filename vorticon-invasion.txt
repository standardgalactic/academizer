Conversation with Gemini

I'm looking for computer games that involve strategy, resource management, hidden information, and management of "value of information" (i.e. figuring out when to explore or exploit), which:

– *can* be beaten in 30 – 120 minutes on your first try (or, there's a clear milestone that's about that long)

– but, it'd be pretty hard to do so unless you are trying really hard. Even if a pretty savvy gamer shouldn't be able to by default.

This is for my broader project of "have a battery of exercises that train/test people's ability to reason generally on openended problems. Each exercise should ideally be pretty different from the other ones.

In this case, I don't expect anyone to have such a game that they _have_ beaten on their first try, but, I'm looking for games where this seems at least plausible, if you were taking a long time to think each turn, or pausing a lot.

The strategy/resource/Value-of-information aspect is meant to correspond to some real world difficulties of running longterm ambitious planning.
Here are some computer games that fit your criteria:

Slay the Spire (Single-player)

Image of Slay the Spire video gameOpens in a new window
store.steampowered.com
Slay the Spire video game
Genre: Deck-building roguelike
Playing time: A single run can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on how quickly you play and how many floors you reach.
Slay the Spire is a deck-building roguelike where you navigate a spire with ever-increasing difficulty.  Each run starts with a basic deck of cards, and you add new cards to your deck as you progress by defeating enemies and picking rewards. The hidden information comes from what cards you will find throughout your run.

The strategic element comes from deciding which cards to add to your deck, how to upgrade your cards, and how to play your cards in each combat encounter.  There's a strong "value of information" aspect to the game, as you need to decide whether to explore new areas to find powerful cards or focus on pushing deeper into the spire to reach the final boss.

Faster Than Light (Single-player)

store.steampowered.com
Faster Than Light video game
Genre: Roguelike space strategy
Playing time: A single run can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your skill level and how lucky you get with events.
Faster Than Light is a roguelike space strategy game where you control a spaceship trying to escape a hostile alien armada.  The game is turn-based, and you spend your turns managing your crew, repairing your ship, and fighting off enemy ships.

The hidden information comes from the random events you encounter as you travel through space.  The strategic element comes from deciding how to allocate your resources, how to manage your crew, and how to fight off enemy ships.  There's a strong "value of information" aspect to the game, as you need to decide whether to spend resources on exploring new sectors to find helpful upgrades or focus on making a beeline for the exit beacon.

These are just two examples, but there are many other games that fit your criteria.  The key is to look for games that are strategic, require resource management, have hidden information, and make you think about the value of information.


The question was from Raymond Arnold at Less wrong
That's interesting! Hi Raymond (if you're still here).  Knowing you're from Less Wrong definitely helps narrow down some recommendations for your project. Here are some options that might be a good fit for your "reasoning on open-ended problems" exercise battery:

Keplerian Motion (Single-player)

Image of Keplerian Motion video gameOpens in a new window
asphalt.fandom.com
Keplerian Motion video game
Genre: Puzzle, Science
Playing time: A single level (representing a single problem) can be solved in 30-120 minutes with focused effort, but offers a clear stopping point if needed.
Keplerian Motion is a physics puzzle game where you manipulate celestial bodies to achieve specific goals.  The game presents you with a scenario, like launching a probe to another planet, and you need to use your understanding of orbital mechanics to solve it.

The strategic element comes from planning your maneuvers and considering the long-term effects of your actions.  There's a hidden information aspect in some levels, where you need to infer information about the celestial bodies based on their observed behavior.  The "value of information" comes into play when deciding whether to spend time gathering more data (e.g., observing orbits) or commit to a course of action with limited information.

Cultist Simulator (Single-player)

Image of Cultist Simulator video gameOpens in a new window
en.wikipedia.org
Cultist Simulator video game
Genre: Narrative card game, Cosmic Horror
Playing time: A single "run" can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on how quickly you explore and how successful you are.
Cultist Simulator is a narrative card game where you play as someone who becomes involved in a hidden world of cults and forbidden knowledge.  The game is played with cards that represent concepts, locations, and people.  You must carefully manage your resources (including your sanity) and explore the hidden connections between the cards to achieve your goals.

The strategic element comes from deciding which cards to play and how to combine them to create effects.  There's a strong hidden information aspect, as the game world is slowly revealed to you through the cards you draw.  The "value of information" comes into play when deciding whether to spend resources on acquiring new knowledge or focus on using the knowledge you already have.

These are two examples that cater more to the "reasoning on open-ended problems" aspect you might be interested in for LessWrong users. They encourage exploration,  information gathering, and long-term planning alongside the strategy and resource management you originally requested.


The first game I thought of, although I haven't beat it yet, and it doesn't involve resource management or strategy, unless you count memory and problem solving as strategies or resources: Android

https://make-it-true-solve-the-circuit.en.softonic.com/android
You're right, "Make it True Solve the Circuit" is a great suggestion for your Less Wrong exercise battery!  While it doesn't have resource management or traditional strategy elements, it certainly fits the other criteria:

Focuses on Reasoning: The core gameplay revolves around applying logic and deduction to solve circuit puzzles.
Hidden Information: The initial state of the circuit can be misleading, requiring analysis to uncover the underlying logic.
Value of Information: Players need to decide which parts of the circuit to test or manipulate to efficiently solve the puzzle.
Open-Ended Problems: Each level presents a unique challenge that requires creative problem-solving.
Here's why it might be a good fit for Less Wrong users specifically:

Challenge for Experienced Thinkers: While some puzzles might be solved quickly, later levels can be quite complex, requiring strong analytical skills.
Focus on Logical Reasoning: The game directly tests the ability to reason about cause and effect within a defined system, similar to many Less Wrong puzzles.
Short Playtime Potential: Individual puzzles can likely be solved within the 30-120 minute range, especially with focused effort.
While it might not be the first game someone thinks of for strategy or resource management, "Make it True Solve the Circuit" definitely offers a valuable exercise in reasoning and information analysis that aligns well with the Less Wrong audience.


The other games I am interested in are stars! 1994, descent, and age of empires
Out of the three games you listed, here's a breakdown of how well they fit your criteria for the Less Wrong exercise battery:

Stars! 1994 (Single-player)

Genre: Real-time 4X strategy (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate)
Fit for Less Wrong Battery: Limited
Stars! 1994 is a classic 4X space strategy game, but it might not be the best fit for your exercise battery.  While it does involve strategy, resource management, and some exploration, the pacing might not align with your goals.

Reasons for Limited Fit:
Completion Time: A full game of Stars! 1994 can take many hours, even on the fastest settings. Beating it in under 2 hours, especially on the first try, is unlikely.
Hidden Information and Value of Information: While there are some elements of exploration and hidden information, they are not the core focus of the game.
Descent (Single-player)

Genre: 6-DOF flight simulator, action
Fit for Less Wrong Battery: No
Descent is a classic first-person shooter set inside 3D environments.  While it does require strategic thinking and spatial reasoning, it doesn't match the other criteria.

Reasons Not a Fit:
Genre Mismatch: Descent is an action game, not a strategy or puzzle game.
Limited Reasoning Focus: While some planning is required, the core gameplay revolves around reflexes and piloting skill.
Age of Empires (Single-player)

Genre: Real-time strategy (RTS)
Fit for Less Wrong Battery: Potential, with limitations
Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game where you build a civilization, gather resources, and defeat your enemies.  It has some potential for your exercise battery, but there are limitations to consider.

Possible Fit:
Strategy and Resource Management: Central aspects of the game.
Value of Information: Some elements of scouting and exploration to reveal the map and enemy locations.
Limitations:
Completion Time: A full campaign or random map game can take well over 2 hours, especially on the first try.
Hidden Information: While present, it's not the core focus compared to some other games.
Alternative Options:

Here are some alternative strategy games that might be a better fit for your criteria:

FTL: Faster Than Light (Single-player): Roguelike space strategy game with hidden information, resource management, and strategic decision-making. Beatable within an hour with good planning.
Slay the Spire (Single-player): Deck-building roguelike where you draft cards and battle enemies. Requires strategic deck building, resource management, and making informed decisions about exploration vs. pushing forward. Runs can take 30 minutes to 2 hours.
I hope this helps narrow down your options for the Less Wrong exercise battery!


Ok I am thinking that the requirements are a pipedream, I have been trying to find such a game for 30 years. It looks like it will have to built from scratch
It's understandable to feel frustrated after searching for so long.  Finding the perfect game for your needs can be tough!  While there might not be a game that ticks every single box perfectly, here are some ideas to consider:

Board Game Adaptations:  There might be a board game that already captures the essence of what you're looking for.  Consider games like "7 Wonders Duel" (fast-paced civilization building with hidden information), "Pandemic" (cooperative strategy with resource management and hidden information), or "Gloomhaven" (campaign-based tactical combat with resource management and strategic decision-making).  Many board games have digital adaptations that could be a good starting point.

Simplify Existing Games:  Could you modify an existing game to fit your needs better?  For example, you could set a time limit for a specific scenario in an RTS game or create a custom scenario in a deck-building game that focuses on exploration vs. exploitation.

Game Development Tools:  There are a variety of game development tools available, some with user-friendly interfaces,  that allow you to create your own game without extensive programming experience.  This would give you the most control over the specific mechanics you're looking for.  Options like Unity or Unreal Engine might be a bit complex, but tools like Twine or GameMaker Studio 2 can be easier to learn.

Here are some additional thoughts on your specific criteria:

Time Limit: The 30-120 minute timeframe might be particularly challenging. Perhaps a slightly longer window (2-3 hours) might open up more possibilities.
Hidden Information: This could be a core mechanic or a progressive element that unfolds as the game progresses.
Building a game from scratch is a great option if you can't find anything that perfectly suits your needs.  Even if you don't create a full-fledged commercial product, a simple prototype could be a valuable tool for your Less Wrong exercise battery.

Good luck with your project!


Settlers of Catan is similar
That's a great observation! Settlers of Catan does share some similarities with the criteria you're looking for:

Strategy and Resource Management: Players need to strategize how to build settlements, manage resources they gather, and trade with others.
Hidden Information: The dice rolls introducing randomness and the fog-of-war created by hidden resource numbers on the board create some hidden information.
Value of Information: Players need to decide when to invest in exploration (finding new settlements) or focus on exploiting existing resources.
However, there are also some key differences:

Completion Time: A typical game of Catan can take 1-2 hours, exceeding your ideal timeframe.
Limited Reasoning Focus: While there's strategic thinking involved, it might not be as open-ended and logic-focused as you might like for the Less Wrong exercise battery.
Here's how Settlers of Catan could be a jumping-off point for your own game design:

Shorten Playtime: Consider a smaller board with fewer players or a specific scenario with a time limit.
Increase Reasoning Focus: Perhaps introduce puzzle elements or logic-based challenges alongside the resource management and trading.
If you're set on building your own game, considering these aspects of Settlers of Catan can be helpful!


I'm going to try to make something like this out of my space exploring typing tutor, Haplopraxis, and its minigame Spherepop
That sounds like a fascinating idea! Combining a space exploration theme with a typing tutor and its minigame has a lot of potential for a unique and engaging learning experience. Here are some ways you could integrate your existing elements to create the kind of exercise you're looking for:

Core Mechanics:

Typing as Action: Typing could be the primary way to interact with the space exploration aspect.
Typing commands to navigate your spaceship (e.g., "warp to Alpha Centauri")
Typing dialogues with alien characters
Typing descriptions of discoveries or scientific observations
Spherepop Integration: Spherepop, the minigame, could be a way to acquire resources or overcome obstacles during exploration.
Typing specific words or phrases could "pop" spheres, granting resources like fuel or knowledge points.
More complex spheres might require strategic typing of longer sentences or specific sequences.
Hidden Information and Value of Information:

Exploration and Resource Acquisition: Typing could unlock new areas of space on the map, revealing resources or hazards.
Decision Points: Certain typing prompts could present the player with choices that require weighing the value of information against the risk of exploration.
Example: "Scan a dark nebula (difficult typing challenge) for potential resources, or continue on a safer route (easier typing challenge)?"
Progression and Difficulty:

Learning Curve: Start with basic typing tasks and progress to more complex ones as the player explores and advances.
Early areas might have simple one-word prompts, while later areas could involve complex sentences or technical jargon related to space exploration.
Adaptive Difficulty: The typing challenges within Spherepop could adjust based on the player's performance.
Struggling players might see more frequent easier "spheres" for resource gathering.
Additional Considerations:

Story and Setting: Weave a narrative around the space exploration to keep players engaged.
Uncover the secrets of a lost civilization, search for a new habitable planet for humanity, or become a galactic trader.
Rewards and Feedback: Provide visual and audio feedback for successful typing and unlocking new areas. Offer different spaceships or upgrades as rewards for completing difficult challenges.
By incorporating these elements, you could create a learning experience that not only improves typing skills but also challenges players to think strategically, analyze information, and make informed decisions – all within an engaging space exploration theme.  This aligns well with the goals of your Less Wrong exercise battery.

Developing a full game can be a complex task, but even a prototype with these core mechanics could be a valuable tool.  Good luck with your project, and feel free to ask if you have any further questions!


What do you know about the movie, on the beach, 1959? I noticed it was similar to Don't look up
You're right, there are some similarities between the 1959 film "On the Beach" and the more recent movie "Don't Look Up." Here's what I can tell you about "On the Beach":

Genre: Post-apocalyptic science fiction drama
Plot: The film takes place in a world devastated by nuclear war. Australia, the furthest continent from the assumed conflict zones, is the only remaining habitable area. The story follows the crew of an American submarine who arrive in Australia to find a society slowly succumbing to radiation sickness as the radioactive fallout spreads.
Themes: The film explores themes of fear, denial, the search for meaning in a doomed world, and the importance of human connection in the face of annihilation.
Here's how it connects to "Don't Look Up":

Similarities:

Both films deal with humanity facing a global threat of extinction (nuclear war in "On the Beach," comet impact in "Don't Look Up").
Both explore themes of denial, societal collapse, and the difficulty of getting people to take action in the face of impending disaster.
Both films use a blend of drama, satire, and dark humor to explore these themes.
Differences:

"On the Beach" is a more character-driven film, focusing on the emotional journey of the characters as they come to terms with their fate.
"Don't Look Up" has a stronger satirical element, criticizing societal apathy and media sensationalism in the face of crisis.
"On the Beach" has a more melancholic tone, while "Don't Look Up" leans towards outrage and frustration.
If you enjoyed "Don't Look Up" and are interested in a more character-driven exploration of a similar theme, "On the Beach" is definitely worth checking out.  It's considered a classic of the post-apocalyptic genre and is praised for its performances and its powerful portrayal of humanity facing its own extinction.  However, be aware that it's a much older film and has a slower pace compared to modern movies.


So I guess I should mention there was a funny moment in the film but I think it would ruin the surprise for anyone who hasn't watched it
You're absolutely right! It's important to avoid spoilers, especially for a classic film like "On the Beach."  Those unexpected moments of humor can be a delightful part of the viewing experience.

If you'd like to discuss the film in general, without spoiling specific scenes, I'd be happy to chat about it with you.  For example, we could talk about:

Your overall impression of the film
The characters and their development
The social commentary or underlying messages of the film
How the film has aged compared to more recent apocalyptic stories
Would you be interested in discussing any of these aspects of "On the Beach"?


I thought it was pessimistic, but people acted very civil. I think in the situation they were in it would be much more chaotic.
You're right, "On the Beach" does present a pessimistic view of humanity's fate.  The situation is bleak - a world slowly dying from nuclear fallout.  However, the film's portrayal of civility in the face of this annihilation is a point of discussion and interpretation.

Here are some reasons why the film might depict a relatively civil society:

Focus on a Specific Region: The film takes place in Australia, geographically isolated from the assumed conflict zones. Perhaps the societal collapse hasn't fully reached its peak there yet.
Stoicism and Acceptance: The characters seem to have accepted their fate, leading to a sense of calm resignation rather than chaotic panic.
Limited Scope: The film focuses on a small group of characters, and may not depict the broader societal breakdown that might be happening elsewhere.
Here are some reasons why the film's civility might be unrealistic:

Denial and Panic: Some would argue that a society facing such a slow, agonizing demise would likely experience periods of denial, followed by outbursts of violence and panic as the situation worsened.
Social Order Breakdown: The infrastructure and social order would likely crumble as people focus on survival, potentially leading to chaos and conflict.
It's interesting that the film's portrayal sparks this conversation.  Perhaps that's part of its enduring power - it makes us think about how we, as a society, might react in such a situation.

Here are some additional thoughts:

The Role of Alcohol: The film does depict some instances of escapism and hedonism through alcohol use, which some might see as a sign of societal strain.
Military Presence: The presence of the American submarine crew suggests some level of order is still maintained, although their role and its long-term sustainability are unclear.
Ultimately, the film leaves some aspects of societal collapse open to interpretation.  The lack of chaos you observed could be a deliberate choice by the filmmakers, or it could be a point for viewers to consider and debate.


Ok that is funny maybe something like mad Max is happening further inland
That's a great observation! It definitely adds another layer of intrigue to the world of "On the Beach."  The film focuses on the characters' struggle with the inevitable, but the possibility of a "Mad Max" style situation happening elsewhere is an interesting thought.

Here are some ways this unseen chaos could be explored:

Radio Broadcasts: Intermittent radio broadcasts from other parts of the world hinting at violence, looting, and societal breakdown could add tension and a sense of the wider catastrophe.
Rumors and Whispers: The characters could hear rumors or stories of violence and chaos from people traveling inland, creating a sense of unease about the unknown.
Flashback Sequences: Brief flashbacks showing the descent into chaos in other parts of the world could provide a stronger contrast to the civility in Australia.
This unseen chaos could also raise some interesting questions:

Is the civility in Australia temporary? Will it eventually break down as the reality of the situation sets in?
Are the characters in Australia truly fortunate, or simply living in a bubble of denial? Is the chaos elsewhere inevitable for them as well?
Could the characters in Australia make a difference? Is there a way to prevent the "Mad Max" scenario from happening there?
Even though the film doesn't explicitly show this chaos, acknowledging its possibility through these elements could add depth and complexity to the story. It  forces the audience to consider the broader consequences of nuclear war and the different ways societies might react to such a global catastrophe.

Here are some additional thoughts:

The Theme of Hope: Perhaps the film's focus on civility is a message of hope, suggesting that even in the face of annihilation, humanity can retain some semblance of order and compassion.
Open Ending: The film's ambiguous ending leaves the characters' fate uncertain. The possibility of a "Mad Max" future adds another layer to this uncertainty.
Whether you see the film's portrayal of civility as realistic or not, it's a thought-provoking choice that has sparked an interesting discussion.  Thanks for sharing your observations!


There was a story in the illustrated man where astronauts were falling to their death in outer space. Do you remember that?
You're absolutely right! There is a story in Ray Bradbury's novel "The Illustrated Man" that features astronauts falling to their death in outer space. The story is titled "The Long Rain" and it depicts a crew stranded on the Venusian surface  where it rains perpetually.

While they aren't technically falling from space, the psychological torment they endure due to the relentless rain creates a powerful image of despair and a sense of falling into an inescapable situation.  The story doesn't explicitly show them falling through space, but the feeling of hopelessness and loss of control is very similar.


I was thinking maybe of Kaleidoscope. Or maybe the movie Dark Star
You're on the right track!  While "The Illustrated Man" doesn't feature astronauts literally falling in space, there are two other possibilities you might be thinking of:

Kaleidoscope (1966): This anthology film, based on the works of Ray Bradbury, does indeed contain a segment titled "The Rocket Man" that features astronauts falling to their deaths in space.   They are ejected from their malfunctioning spaceship and plummet towards a planet with a deadly atmosphere.

Dark Star (1973): This dark comedy sci-fi film features a crew of astronauts on a long, tedious mission. While there isn't a scene of them explicitly falling through space, there are moments where they are in danger of being ejected or caught in the vacuum of space.  The film has a darkly humorous tone and explores themes of boredom, existential dread, and the absurdity of space travel.

It's possible you're misremembering the specific details from "The Illustrated Man," or you might be conflating elements from both "Kaleidoscope" and "Dark Star."

Here's a quick breakdown to help you decide:

Focus on Falling: If the central image you remember is astronauts literally falling through space towards a certain doom, then "Kaleidoscope" is the more likely candidate.

Dark Humor:  If you recall a darkly humorous tone to the scene, then "Dark Star" might be a possibility.

Would you like to know more about either of these films?


I was looking for similarities with On the beach
I apologize for the confusion!

There aren't any direct story connections between "On the Beach" and stories featuring astronauts falling to their deaths in space. "On the Beach" focuses on a more grounded, societal collapse scenario on Earth due to nuclear fallout.

However, there could be some thematic similarities to consider:

Facing Inevitable Doom: Both "On the Beach" and stories like "The Long Rain" (from "The Illustrated Man") or the astronauts falling in space deal with characters facing an inescapable and horrifying death.

Loss of Control: The characters in "On the Beach" slowly succumb to radiation poisoning, losing control over their bodies and their fate. Similarly, astronauts falling to their deaths have no control over their situation.

Focus on Humanity:  Despite the different settings, both stories explore what it means to be human in the face of overwhelming circumstances.  "On the Beach" explores themes of connection, acceptance, and finding meaning in a doomed world. Stories of astronauts facing death might explore themes of fear, isolation, and the will to survive.

Even though the stories on the surface seem very different, they share some underlying themes that can be interesting to explore.

Here are some additional thoughts:

Genre Contrast: "On the Beach" is a science fiction drama, while stories of astronauts falling to their deaths often fall under the subgenre of "hard science fiction" or space horror.

Focus on Setting: "On the Beach" is very much grounded in a realistic portrayal of Earth, while stories about astronauts take place in the vastness of space.

While there isn't a direct story connection, these thematic similarities might be what you were picking up on when you thought of the astronauts falling in space in relation to "On the Beach."


Ok well I thought maybe on the beach wasn't about nuclear war but about mortality, futility, and optimism
You're absolutely right!  Your interpretation of "On the Beach" focusing on mortality, futility, and optimism is a much deeper and more accurate reading than just a story about nuclear war.

Here's how the film explores these themes:

Mortality: The ever-present threat of radiation poisoning and the slow, inevitable decline of the characters force them to confront their own mortality.
Futility: The knowledge that nothing can be done to stop the radioactive fallout creates a sense of futility and helplessness. The characters grapple with the meaning of life and action in a world where their actions seem to have no impact on the outcome.
Optimism: Despite the bleak situation, the film also portrays moments of love, compassion, and beauty. The characters find solace in human connection and search for meaning and purpose in their remaining time. This flicker of optimism, even in the face of annihilation, is a powerful aspect of the story.
Nuclear War as a Backdrop:

The film uses nuclear war as a catalyst to explore these deeper themes.  It's not just a story about the technicalities of nuclear war or the physical destruction it causes.  It's about the psychological and emotional impact on the characters as they face their own mortality and the slow death of their world.

Examples from the Film:

The Party: The characters throw a party knowing it's their last chance to celebrate life and connection.
The Use of Alcohol: Some characters turn to alcohol as a form of escapism, highlighting the futility of the situation.
The Love Story: The developing relationship between two characters offers a glimmer of hope and optimism even amidst the despair.
Your Interpretation:

Your recognition of these deeper themes shows a great understanding of the film.  "On the Beach" is a powerful story that transcends the genre of science fiction and explores universal human experiences of mortality, the search for meaning, and the enduring power of human connection.

Would you like to explore any of these themes or aspects of the film in more detail?


Ok I was thinking of maybe doing a script for a commander keen movie, set against threats of nuclear war or cold war in the mid eighties on radio and television, which affect keens dreams. Maybe there are fallout siren drills in a school and then nightmares reinterpretting it as alien invasion and capture
That's a really cool idea for a Commander Keen movie script! It adds a layer of depth and complexity to the classic character while staying true to the themes of childhood imagination and battling aliens. Here's how you could develop this concept:

Billy Blaze's Internal Conflict:

Daytime Reality: Young Billy Blaze experiences the anxieties of the Cold War through school drills and news reports about nuclear threats.
Nighttime Dreams: These anxieties manifest in his dreams as fantastical alien invasions, transforming his anxieties into the familiar territory of battling space villains. Commander Keen becomes his alter ego, a way to confront his fears in a world he can control.
Connecting Dreams and Reality:

Symbolic Elements: Objects or experiences from Billy's day can be reinterpreted in his dreams. The school siren becomes a spaceship's warning signal, the classroom becomes a spaceship interior, etc.
Fallout Shelter as Inspiration: The school's fallout shelter could be the inspiration for a hidden "launchpad" in Billy's house, leading to his spaceship.
Building the Threat:

Cold War News Reports: Weave in snippets of actual Cold War news reports or dramatizations of the anxieties of the time to establish the real-world context.
Nightmares Escalate: As Billy's anxieties grow, his dreams become more intense, with the alien threat becoming more elaborate and dangerous.
Commander Keen's Role:

Childhood Heroism: Despite his fear, Billy, as Commander Keen, uses his ingenuity and resourcefulness to overcome the alien menace.
Humor and Action: Balance the dark themes with the classic Commander Keen humor and exciting action sequences during the dream battles.
Resolution:

Facing Fears: Perhaps Billy uses the courage he displays in his dreams to stand up to schoolyard bullies or express his anxieties to a parent or teacher.
Power of Imagination: The film could emphasize that while the Cold War threat was real, Billy's imagination provided him with a way to process his fears and find a sense of control.
Here are some additional ideas:

Incorporate Period Details: Include references to pop culture, fashion, and technology from the mid-eighties to create a realistic Cold War atmosphere.
Parental Concern: Show Billy's parents noticing his anxieties and trying to understand his fascination with Commander Keen.
Multiple Dreams: Billy could have multiple dreams throughout the film, each one representing a different Cold War fear (e.g., nuclear winter, alien invasion, technological breakdown).
This is just a starting point, but it gives you a framework for a Commander Keen movie script that explores a unique and thought-provoking angle. It blends nostalgia with a coming-of-age story and explores the power of imagination in the face of real-world anxieties.


I am liking it. Give some suggestions for minor character development plots everyday occurrences as prompts for the script writers.
Here are some suggestions for minor character development plots using everyday occurrences as prompts for your Commander Keen movie script:

Schoolyard

New Student: A new student arrives at Billy's school, nervous and withdrawn. Billy, initially hesitant, uses his imagination to create a friendly alien character (separate from Commander Keen) to help the new student feel welcome. (Theme: Empathy and Overcoming Shyness)
Bully: A school bully picks on Billy, making fun of his fascination with Commander Keen. The bully gets caught in a real-life situation where Billy's knowledge of science or space trivia (learned from Commander Keen games) helps him save the day. (Theme: Standing Up to Bullies and Unexpected Heroes)
Home Life

Parental Worries: Billy's parents express concern about his constant playing of Commander Keen games. Billy confides in them about his anxieties regarding the Cold War, and they reassure him while encouraging healthy ways to manage his fears. (Theme: Parent-Child Communication and Understanding)
Neighbor's Dog: Billy's grumpy neighbor has a stray dog that keeps wandering into Billy's yard. Billy uses his resourcefulness (inspired by Commander Keen) to build a humane trap and reunite the dog with its owner, softening the neighbor's demeanor. (Theme: Resourcefulness and Kindness)
Fallout Shelter Drill

Janitor with a Past: During a school drill, the kindly janitor reveals he was a soldier during a previous conflict. He shares stories of courage and resilience, inspiring Billy to face his own anxieties. (Theme: Unexpected Mentors and Finding Courage)
Overzealous Teacher: A particularly strict teacher takes the fallout shelter drill to an extreme, creating panic among the students. Billy, channeling his Commander Keen persona, uses reason and logic to calm the situation. (Theme: Leadership and Overcoming Authority Figures)
Remember

These are just springboards. Feel free to adapt them or create your own based on your vision for the film.
Consider how these minor character plots can intersect with Billy's main story arc and his anxieties about the Cold War.
Use these minor characters to provide different perspectives and emotional beats throughout the film.
By incorporating these everyday occurrences and the development of minor characters, you can add depth and humor to the script while staying true to the core themes of the Commander Keen universe.


Give a list of alien technologies and minor characters and settings for the alien works, incorporating details from marooned on Mars and aliens ate my babysitter
Combining Influences: Aliens Ate My Babysitter & Marooned on Mars
Here's a list that merges alien technologies, minor characters, and settings from "Aliens Ate My Babysitter" and "Marooned on Mars" to inspire your Commander Keen movie script:

Alien Technologies:

Disguised Food Pods: Building on the premise of the baby food pods from "Aliens Ate My Babysitter," the alien invaders could use seemingly harmless everyday objects (soda cans, apples) as disguised pods that hatch into small, aggressive creatures.
Mind Control Devices: Inspired by the hypnotic crib mobile from "Aliens Ate My Babysitter," the aliens could have headbands or implants that subdue or control human minds.
Teleportation Devices: A nod to the teleportation technology in "Marooned on Mars," the aliens might use teleportation belts or doorways to move around quickly and capture humans.
Ray Guns with Unpredictable Effects: Similar to the "Mars Rays" in "Marooned on Mars," the alien ray guns could have unpredictable effects, shrinking people, swapping bodies, or causing comical mutations.
Minor Characters:

Spacefaring Janitor: This character, inspired by the kindly janitor from "Marooned on Mars," could be a retired space janitor on Earth who secretly knows more about alien technology than he lets on. He becomes Billy's unlikely mentor.
Tech-Savvy Babysitter: A twist on the babysitter from "Aliens Ate My Babysitter," this teenager might be secretly tech-savvy and fascinated by conspiracy theories about aliens. She ends up helping Billy fight the alien invasion.
Delusional Conspiracy Theorist Neighbor: This character, reminiscent of the conspiracy theorist from "Marooned on Mars," is convinced aliens are already among us. His outlandish theories turn out to be partially true, and he becomes a reluctant ally to Billy.
Captured Earth Scientist: A brilliant scientist studying alien life is captured by the aliens. Billy, in his Commander Keen persona, must rescue the scientist, who holds the key to defeating the alien threat.
Settings (Blending Earth Locations with Alien Spacecraft):

Secret Underground Lab: Inspired by the hidden Martian lab in "Marooned on Mars," there could be a secret government lab beneath Billy's school studying recovered alien artifacts. This becomes Billy's base of operations as Commander Keen.
Abandoned Theme Park: An abandoned theme park, like the one from "Aliens Ate My Babysitter," could be a temporary hideout or battlefield between Billy and the disguised alien creatures.
The School Bus: Billy's iconic school bus from the Commander Keen games becomes his customized battle vehicle, tricked out with weapons and gadgets to fight the alien menace.
The Spaceship Cafeteria: The alien spaceship could have a section resembling a bizarre, malfunctioning cafeteria, where the disguised food pods are dispensed. This becomes a chaotic battleground for Billy.
By incorporating these elements, you can create a unique blend of the wacky humor from "Aliens Ate My Babysitter" with the science fiction adventure of "Marooned on Mars."  It injects some humor and familiar references into the Cold War anxieties of your Commander Keen movie script.


Write some dialogue for an early scene
Sure, here's some dialogue for an early scene in your Commander Keen movie script:

[FADE IN]

INT. BILLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Twelve-year-old BILLY BLAZE sits hunched over his glowing computer, eyes glued to the screen. The room is cluttered with posters of spaceships and aliens, alongside trophies and certificates for academic achievement.  A half-eaten bowl of cereal sits forgotten on his desk.

On the screen, a pixelated spaceship blasts through a field of green stars. The words "COMMANDER KEEN: DEFENDER OF EARTH" flash across the screen in bold, pixelated letters.

Suddenly, a loud, piercing ALARM blares from down the hall. Billy jumps in his seat, startled.

<center>BILLY</center>
<center>(Muttering to himself)</center>
<center>Not again...</center><br>

Billy glances at his clock. It reads 7:30 AM. He sighs and throws on a worn Commander Keen t-shirt over his pajamas.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Billy walks alongside his best friend, KARLA, a girl with bright pink hair and a skeptical expression. Students and teachers hustle towards their classrooms, some looking panicked, others resigned. A shrill SIREN wails in the background.

<center>KARLA</center>
<center>Another drill? Don't they ever get tired of scaring the living daylights out of us?</center><br>

<center>BILLY</center>
<center>(Shrugs)</center><br>
<center>Maybe it's real this time. The news keeps talking about those tensions with... what's-his-face-ville again?</center><br>

<center>KARLA</center>
<center>Vladigrad? Billy, it's like, every week. Besides, even if it is real, what are we gonna do? Fight them with dodgeballs?</center><br>

Billy glances nervously down the hall. A poster on the wall depicts a smiling family huddled under a table, with the caption "Be Prepared: Your Family's Fallout Shelter Guide."

<center>BILLY</center>
<center>I don't know... but it gives me the creeps.</center><br>

They reach their classroom door. MRS. HENDERSON, a stern teacher with short brown hair, stands outside, her face grim.

<center>MRS. HENDERSON</center>
<center>Alright class, fallout drill. Everyone line up quietly and proceed to the designated shelter.</center><br>

The students groan and shuffle into a line. Billy feels a knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach.

INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - DAY

The basement is a cramped, windowless space filled with rows of metal folding chairs. Students and teachers sit shoulder-to-shoulder, looking bored or fidgety.  A droning voice plays over a loudspeaker, outlining fallout shelter procedures.

Billy sits next to Karla, doodling spaceships in his notebook.

<center>KARLA</center>
<center>(Whispering)</center><br>
<center>You okay, Billy? You look like you're about to launch yourself into space.</center><br>

Billy looks around the cramped shelter, his imagination taking over. The flickering fluorescent lights transform into alien scanning beams, the metal chairs morph into spaceship control panels.

<center>BILLY</center>
<center>(Whispering back)</center><br>
<center>Maybe I will... Just gotta find the launchpad.</center><br>

Karla raises an eyebrow. Billy gives her a small, reassuring smile. He closes his eyes, picturing himself as Commander Keen, his anxieties morphing into the familiar thrill of battling space invaders.

FADE OUT.


Ok a list of all of the topics we've discussed.
Here's a list of all the topics we've discussed:

Symbolism and Metaphor:  Symbolic elements can add depth to the story and allow viewers to interpret the themes on their own level. The fallout shelter drills in the Commander Keen movie script could symbolize Billy's anxieties about the Cold War.

By using these techniques, these films and stories can make complex topics like nuclear war, mortality, and societal collapse more engaging and thought-provoking for a wider audience. They allow viewers to confront these issues in a safe and entertaining environment.

Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss further about how these stories handle complex topics?


Ok there is some concern that POST-APOCALYPTIC stories are being commodified to keep people in a distracted state
You raise an interesting point! There is some concern that post-apocalyptic stories are being commodified, using our fascination with destruction and survival to keep us distracted from real-world problems. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

The Appeal of Post-Apocalyptic Stories:

Exploration of Human Nature: These stories allow us to explore how people might react in extreme situations, revealing our capacity for both good and evil.
Catharsis and Release: They provide a safe outlet for anxieties about real-world threats like climate change or pandemics.
Sense of Adventure and Hope: Despite the bleak setting, some stories highlight human resilience and the struggle for survival, offering a sense of hope for the future.
Commodification and Distraction:

Overused Tropes and Cliches: The constant churn of post-apocalyptic stories can lead to formulaic plots and repetitive themes, making them less impactful.
Focus on Spectacle over Substance: Some stories prioritize flashy visuals and action sequences over exploring deeper social or philosophical themes.
Distraction from Real Action: The constant barrage of fictional apocalyptic scenarios can make us feel overwhelmed and less likely to take action on real-world problems.
Finding Balance:

Critical Consumption: We can be critical consumers of these stories, looking for ones that offer insightful social commentary alongside entertainment.
Engagement with Real Issues: Post-apocalyptic stories can spark discussions about real-world issues like climate change or resource scarcity, motivating us to take action.
Supporting Quality Storytelling: Rewarding stories that explore these themes in a thoughtful and nuanced way can encourage creators to move beyond tired tropes.
Is it All Bad?

Not necessarily.  Post-apocalyptic stories can be a powerful tool for exploring complex themes and sparking important conversations.  The key lies in being a critical consumer and using these stories as a springboard for reflection and action, not just mindless entertainment.

What are your thoughts on this?  Do you think there's a way to enjoy post-apocalyptic stories while remaining engaged with real-world issues?


My thought was to include blueprints for new inventions embedded serruptiously through the film and did 
That's a really interesting idea to embed blueprints for new inventions subtly throughout a movie! It adds a layer of interactivity and intrigue for viewers who pick up on them. Here are some ways you could incorporate blueprints in your Commander Keen movie script:

Subtle Integration:

Background Details: Show blueprints for Billy's inventions (weapons, gadgets for his spaceship) as background elements in his room or during scenes where he's tinkering.
News Ticker or Montage: Flash glimpses of blueprints amidst news reports about the Cold War or scientific advancements.
Tech Savvy Character's Notes: If you introduce a tech-savvy character like the babysitter from your brainstorming session, their notes or sketches could contain blueprints for potential alien-fighting devices.
Interactive Element:

Website or App: Create a dedicated website or app where viewers can unlock hidden blueprints based on clues in the movie. These blueprints could be for inventions seen in the film or even bonus ideas related to Commander Keen's universe.
Special Features: Include the blueprints as a special feature on the movie's DVD/Blu-ray release, rewarding attentive viewers with a deeper look into the technology of the film.
Storytelling Potential:

Hidden Message: The blueprints could be a coded message left behind by a friendly alien race, instructing humans on how to build a device to defend against a greater threat.
Billy's Imagination: Show the blueprints as figments of Billy's imagination, foreshadowing his future as Commander Keen, a resourceful inventor who builds gadgets to fight space villains.
Lost Technology: The blueprints could depict forgotten human technology rediscovered by Billy, giving him an edge in his battles against the aliens.
Here are some additional tips:

Vary the Complexity: Have some blueprints be simple enough for viewers to understand, while others can be more technical, creating a sense of mystery.
Connect to the Plot: Ensure the blueprints tie into the overall story, whether they foreshadow future events or reveal hidden agendas.
Visual Design: Make the blueprints visually interesting, using clear lines, detailed schematics, and a recognizable style that fits the film's aesthetic.
By incorporating blueprints subtly and creatively, you can add an extra layer of engagement for viewers who enjoy puzzles and hidden details. It can also enrich the story by hinting at the world-building or Billy's potential as a future inventor.


I also thought of doing a geographically tuned release, where the actors are averaged and recalibrated to their viewing location, and not explicitly mentioning Billy's exact age or gender, although I expect that these would be technically difficult and potentially controversial
Those are certainly innovative ideas for your Commander Keen movie script! While both geographically tuned releases and gender/age ambiguity present technical and conceptual challenges, here's a breakdown of the potential:

Geographically Tuned Release:

Technical Difficulty: Currently, there's no established technology to seamlessly alter actors' appearances based on viewer location. It would require significant advancements in facial recognition, deepfakes, and real-time rendering, raising ethical concerns about manipulating actors' likenesses.
Logistical Challenges: Creating multiple versions of the film with different actors would be incredibly expensive and time-consuming. Distribution and ensuring viewers get the "correct" version would be complex.
Conceptual Challenges:

Impact on Storytelling: A geographically tuned release might disrupt the narrative flow and the audience's connection to the characters. The story might lose its universality if the characters constantly change.
Loss of Actor's Performance: Averaging different actors could dilute the nuances of each individual performance.
Alternative Approaches:

Diverse Cast: Consider casting a diverse group of actors to represent a wider range of ethnicities and backgrounds. This would resonate with a broader audience without needing to alter the film for each location.
Universal Themes: Focus on themes of childhood anxieties, facing fears, and the power of imagination that transcend geographical boundaries.
Gender/Age Ambiguity:

Technical Difficulty: While not as complex as geographically tuned releases, de-aging actors or completely obscuring their gender through costuming and special effects would require significant resources.
Narrative Ambiguity: Keeping Billy's age and gender completely ambiguous could leave the audience feeling disconnected or confused about the character's motivations and experiences.
Alternative Approaches:

Androgynous Clothing: Dress Billy in clothing that doesn't explicitly signal a specific gender, allowing viewers to identify with the character in their own way.
Focus on Voice and Action: Let Billy's voice acting and actions as Commander Keen take center stage, allowing the audience to connect with the character's personality and heroism.
Overall:

While both ideas are innovative, the technical and conceptual hurdles might be too high to overcome at this stage.  However, exploring these concepts can lead to creative solutions that enhance your story's inclusivity and appeal to a wider audience.  Consider alternative approaches that achieve a similar effect without the technical difficulties.

Here are some additional ideas:

Focus on Universality: Craft a story that explores themes that resonate with viewers of all ages and backgrounds, regardless of location.
Let the Audience Imagine: Leave some aspects of the characters open to interpretation, allowing viewers to connect with the story on a personal level.
Remember, the most important thing is to tell a compelling story with strong characters.  While technical innovations can be exciting, the heart of a good film lies in its narrative and emotional impact.


Ok I was thinking of using one set of actors or no actors and calibrating them through location based filtering to alter their appearance in each geographic locality
I understand your desire to create a unique viewing experience for your Commander Keen movie script. While location-based filtering to alter actors' appearances is an interesting concept, there are some significant challenges to consider:

Technical Feasibility:

Current Technology Limitations: As of now, there's no established technology that can seamlessly alter actors' appearances in real-time based on a viewer's location. Techniques like deepfakes require significant training data and computational power, and achieving a natural and believable effect across diverse demographics would be extremely difficult.
Privacy Concerns: Location-based filtering raises privacy concerns. Viewers might be hesitant to allow a movie to access their location data for such purposes.
Logistical Challenges:

Multiple Versions: Creating multiple versions of the film with subtly altered actors for each region would be incredibly time-consuming and expensive. Distribution and ensuring viewers get the "correct" version would be complex.
Maintaining Quality: The quality of the alterations could vary greatly depending on the location, potentially creating a disjointed viewing experience.
Conceptual Obstacles:

Disruption of Storytelling: Constantly altering the actors' appearances might break the immersion and distract viewers from the narrative. The story might lose its universality if the characters keep changing subtly.
Loss of Performance Nuance: The process of altering appearances could diminish the subtleties of the actors' performances, impacting the emotional connection with the characters.
Alternative Approaches:

Here are some ways to achieve a similar effect without the technical hurdles:

Diverse Cast: Cast a group of actors with a variety of ethnicities and backgrounds. This creates a more inclusive experience without needing location-based alterations.
Universal Themes: Focus on themes of childhood anxieties, courage, and imagination that resonate with viewers worldwide, regardless of location.
Subtle Costuming and Makeup: Use subtle variations in costuming and makeup to create a more diverse look for the characters without relying on extensive digital manipulation.
Location-Based Storytelling:

Interactive Elements: Consider incorporating location-based interactive elements through a dedicated app or website. This could offer viewers additional content or backstory based on their location.
Remember:

The most important thing is to tell a compelling story with characters that resonate with your audience. While technical innovations are exciting, the heart of a good film lies in its narrative and emotional impact.

Additional Ideas:

Focus on Animation: Consider using animation instead of live-action actors. Animation offers more stylistic flexibility and allows for a wider range of character designs that could appeal to a global audience.
Multiple Languages: Dub or subtitle the film in multiple languages for a wider international audience.
By focusing on strong storytelling and exploring alternative approaches, you can create a unique and engaging experience for viewers around the world without relying on location-based filtering of actors' appearances.


Ok maybe it is a ridiculous idea and maybe problematic. But I don't see how it isn't feasible. I just mean the characters would look more like average characteristics of where the film is released, it might be problematic only because it is not a typical way to release a film, alternately the identities could be scrambled or randomized if there are ethical problems with the first method
I understand your frustration. It's great that you're thinking outside the box and trying to create a truly unique viewing experience. While location-based filtering for actor appearances might seem feasible in theory, here's a deeper dive into why it's currently impractical:

Technical Challenges:

Data Requirements: To convincingly alter an actor's appearance to resemble "average characteristics" of a location, you'd need a massive amount of data. This includes facial structure variations across ethnicities, ages, and genders within a specific region. Acquiring and processing this data ethically would be a major hurdle.
Real-Time Rendering: Altering appearances in real-time based on location requires significant processing power that current streaming or playback technologies might not be able to handle. It could lead to buffering, lag, or a degraded viewing experience.
Unforeseen Biases: The algorithms used to create "average" appearances could unintentionally perpetuate biases based on available data.
Ethical Concerns:

Consent and Privacy: Obtaining user consent for location tracking and using that data to alter their viewing experience raises significant privacy concerns. Viewers might feel uncomfortable with a film accessing their location for such purposes.
Cultural Appropriation: The attempt to create a "typical" look for a location could be perceived as cultural appropriation, oversimplifying diverse populations.
Alternative Approaches:

Here are some ways to achieve a similar effect without the technical and ethical issues:

Storytelling Techniques: Use narrative elements like flashbacks or news reports to showcase the cultural diversity within a specific location.
Multiple Storylines: Consider weaving together stories from different characters across various locations, offering a broader and more inclusive perspective.
Interactive Elements: Explore the possibility of location-based interactive elements through a companion app or website. This could provide viewers with additional content specific to their region without altering the film itself.
The Future of Filmmaking:

While location-based filtering might be a sci-fi concept now, advancements in AI and deepfakes could make it more feasible in the future. However, ethical considerations and responsible implementation will be crucial.

Focus on the Story:

Remember, the most important aspect of any film is a compelling story with well-developed characters.  Focus on creating a story that resonates with a global audience and explore innovative ways to tell it without compromising on technical feasibility or ethical principles.

Additional Ideas:

Focus on Universality: Craft a story that explores human emotions and experiences that transcend geographical boundaries.
Diverse Cast and Crew: Ensure your cast and crew represent a variety of backgrounds and perspectives. This will naturally create a more inclusive and relatable film.
By focusing on strong storytelling and finding creative solutions, you can create a unique and engaging cinematic experience for your Commander Keen movie script.
