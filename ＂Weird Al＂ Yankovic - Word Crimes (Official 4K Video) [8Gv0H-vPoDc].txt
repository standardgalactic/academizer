Everybody shut up
If you can't write in the proper way
If you don't know how to conjugate
Maybe you flunked that class
And maybe now you find
That people mock you on the cloud
Okay now here's the deal
I'll try to educate you
Gonna familiarize you with the nomenclature
You learn the definitions
Of nouns and prepositions
Literacy's your mission
And that's why I think it's a good time
To learn some grammar
Work on that grammar
You should know it
It's less or it's fewer
Like people who were
Never raised in us who were
I hate these word crimes
Like I could care less
That means you do care less
And it's a little bit more wrong
You better slow down
And use the right pronoun
Shut the world you're no clown
Say you got an IT
Followed by a puzzle
Say you still know what does that mean
You would not use this in this case
As a possessive
It's a contraction
It's a contraction
Okay now here's some notes
Syntax you're always bangin'
No X in Espresso
You're part of simple stang
But I don't want your dreams
If you really want
Leave out that Oxford kind
Just keep them under
Are you?
Are words not letters
Get it together
Just spell checker
You should never
Write words using numbers
Unless you're seven
Or your name is Prince
I hate these word crimes
You really need to hate them crimes
I need the crimes
I'm not free
Well you should hire
I got an M
To help you to sing
One thing I ask of you
Time to learn your homophones is past
To learn to diagram a sentence to
Always say to whom, don't ever say to who
And listen up when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis
You finish second grade I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well
Better figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
But it didn't event what's literal
But just now you said
You literally couldn't get out of bed
That really makes me want to literally smack a crowbar
I'm sick of stupid hate
I'm sick of email
It's quite apparent
You're a grander parent
You're incoherent
You're a bad boy
It's really fantastic
That was sarcastic
I hate these word crimes
I hate these words
I think you should always
Write an email to your lost cause
Go back to preschool
Get out of the gene pool
So your hands are not drool
Nevermind I give up
Really no I give up
Thanks for watching
